        <h1>Atonal Harmony - Mozart</h1>
        <p>According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        From the moment of the Consonias’ birth, music had been everything to them; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        The first breath of spring swept gently through the capital of music, Groove, brushing every corner of the city with life, and all that had slumbered through the cold winter began to awaken.

        Behind the Rotonda Music Academy, where young Consonias trained to be melodists, there was a forest that seemed to wear spring more boldly than anywhere else. The bare trees now bore tiny green leaves while bashful buds peeked curiously from the lush grasses on the hillside.

        An elegantly dressed girl strolled into the forest, her eyes scanning the trees, seemingly looking for something—or someone. After a long walk, she arrived at the top of a hill where a towering tree stood, and she found her target.

        “Wake up, Beethoven.” She circled around to the front of the tree and gently tapped the shoulder of the younger girl sitting on the ground who curled up with her knees close to her chest, fast asleep.

        “Ah…”  Beethoven awoke at the sudden call. Her eyes slowly fluttered open. She seemed confused at first, but then recognition dawned as she looked up at the confident and commanding figure standing before her.

        She blinked a few times before giving the girl, Mozart, a gentle, almost sheepish smile, and said, “Oh, it’s Mozart. You’ve found me again. Haha.”

        “Why do you keep taking naps in such strange places? It’s still cold these days, and you’ll catch a cold sleeping outside like this,” Mozart scolded, arms crossed as she looked down at Beethoven with a disapproving glare. Despite her young age, she carried herself with a maturity and decisiveness well beyond her years.

        “I didn’t mean to,” Beethoven replied in her soft, airy voice. “Spring’s here, so I thought I’d take a walk in the forest. I got tired, so I sat down to rest. I started watching the sounds of the birds, the forest, the wind… and then I ended up falling asleep…”

        Beethoven was completely truthful about her words—she could indeed see sounds.

        Beethoven was born with a hearing loss in one ear. She could barely hear with her left ear—a devastating flaw in the music-centric world of the Consonias. Because of her congenital defect, she had been rejected by her family and even bullied by her peers ever since she was little. Fortunately, she met Mozart, who stood up for her and taught her music. It was also Mozart, who discovered her unique gift: the ability to see sound.

        In Beethoven’s eyes, different tones and melodies appeared as vibrant colors. It was an extraordinary talent that allowed her to perceive music in a completely different way, setting her apart from the other talented melodists.

        “The sounds of spring are so beautiful… Ah-choo!”

        “I may not know whether they’re beautiful or not—because I can’t see them—but I do know one thing: you are extremely dense,” Mozart retorted sharply, but her actions contradicted her words as she took off her coat and draped it over Beethoven’s shoulders.

        “Haha, it’s fine because I got you, Mozart,” Beethoven chuckled, snuggling into the coat which was still warm from Mozart’s body heat. As she slipped her hands into the pockets, her fingers brushed against a piece of folded paper. Curiously, she pulled it out and gasped with delight, “This is… a musical score! Did you compose a new piece?” 

“Mm, it’s not finished yet,” Mozart answered, “I’m still working on the ending and it needs polishing.”

        “I want to hear it!”

        “No, it’s not ready…” Mozart’s voice faltered when she saw the eager, excited look on Beethoven’s face. Breathing a resigned sigh, she relented. “Fine.”

        Placing her hand over the musical sigil on her skin—a magical tattoo that all Consonias were born with—Mozart summoned her instrument, a violin. She brought it to her shoulder and began to play.

        The piercing sound of strings echoed through the forest, cutting through the air like the final chill of winter that lingered in the recently awakened verdancy. Just as the icy tension reached its peak, a warm and gentle harmony joined in—it was Beethoven, who joined the performance with her instrument.

        Two contrasting melodies began to intertwine, chasing each other through the air. Although they seemed discordant at first, an intricate harmony emerged as the music unfolded. They weaved smoothly into each other like the alteration of seasons—different yet connected—full of changes and vibrant energy.

        Their extraordinary collaboration drew the attention of the forest’s animals. They gathered to listen to their music in awe. Even students nearby were drawn by the sound, quietly forming a crowd in the forest as they played.

        Deeply immersed in the music, Beethoven did not notice the growing audience. Her heart nearly leaped out of her chest when she opened her eyes at the end of their performance and found herself surrounded by a wall of people. She scrambled to hide behind Mozart, trembling as a burst of applause greeted her.

        Due to her hearing impairment, Beethoven had lived a life filled with rejection and bullying which eventually led to her timid personality. She could only let her guard down around close friends like Mozart.

        “It’s okay. They mean no harm,” Mozart said, her voice unusually soft as she tried to comfort the frightened Beethoven. At the same time, she reflected on the remarkable performance she and Beethoven had just shared.

        Her latest composition, which had previously stagnated in its creation, was now completed effortlessly thanks to Beethoven’s improvisation. In fact, their collaboration had elevated the composition to an entirely new level. Mozart could not help but marvel once again at her friend’s extraordinary talent.

        ‘She has such exceptional talent, one that needs to be protected and guided, and I have to take that role. Only by helping her gift flourish can I push myself further and reach the unprecedented realm of music.’

        Despite her musical and intellectual precociousness, Mozart was still a child—one who had yet to face the trials and hardships of life. Her world was simple, black and white, and her thoughts were pure. At the time, she genuinely cared for Beethoven and wholeheartedly appreciated her friend’s brilliance while firmly believing in her own possibilities.

        However, time mercilessly flowed on, and both of them grew into women.

        As the years passed, both Mozart and Beethoven, each possessing promising talent, became melodists. Beethoven’s gift grew ever more dazzling, reaching a level no one could hope to bridge with sheer effort. It was then that Mozart came to understand the bitter sting of jealousy. Though she tried to suppress this negative emotion with reason, her attempts were as futile as trying to extinguish a wildfire with a single cup of water.

        She was ultimately defeated when she learned that Beethoven had acquired the miraculous instrument. It was at that moment she finally understood: the one truly chosen by music itself, was not her—it was Beethoven. She loathed Beethoven’s talent, yet, at the same time, she could not help but admire it. The realization plunged her into a whirlwind of conflicting emotions, and she became unsure of how to face Beethoven, a feeling that she once had toward her parents.

        Mozart’s parents were part of the ordinary masses who had been eliminated early due to the lack of musical talent. Living humble lives, they revered the orchestras from afar while pouring all their love and hope into nurturing their daughter.

        Mozart loved them deeply and had always been grateful for their care. Yet, at the same time, she resented their complacent attitude about mediocrity. Unable to understand their mindset, she concealed this contradictory mix of love and disdain, not knowing that it continued to fester quietly in her heart.

        Mozart, finding it impossible to reconcile these extreme emotions, chose avoidance as her solution, and she repeated the same pattern when she faced the same dilemma with Beethoven—she avoided her.

        Yet, Beethoven had no knowledge of her inner turmoil. She continued to seek Mozart with tireless determination. One way, Beethoven waited outside the rehearsal room, refusing to leave for even a moment. Her patience paid off when she finally saw Mozart finish her rehearsal and step out.

        “Mozart!” Beethoven greeted her with a radiant smile, “I’ve been waiting for you. You must be starving after all the practice… I bought your favorite snacks. Take one.”

        “No, thank you,” Mozart responded, her tone cold and distant as she stepped back to maintain space between them.

        “Oh… is that so…” Beethoven faltered, her hands fidgeting nervously. She did not want to leave, but neither did she know how to stay.

        “Do you need something?” Mozart asked curtly.

        “N-no… nothing… Oh! Good luck with leading the performance tomorrow!” Beethoven earnestly wished.

        The Consonias often received requests for aid from other races for the power in their music was capable of purifying and suppressing curses and malevolent forces, and the Chelidonian Winds Orchestra, to which both Mozart and Beethoven belonged, was tasked with a quest to prevent a ferocious monster from wreaking havoc by sealing it on a distant planet at the border of the realm of gods.

        Mozart had been chosen by Haydn, the conductor of the Chelidonian Winds Orchestra, to serve as the lead melodist for the mission—a critical role that bore great risks, perhaps for most of the melodists but definitely not for a sophisticated genius like Mozart. In response to Beethoven’s encouragement, she only gave a curt nod before turning and walking away.

        Unexpectedly, disaster struck during the performance.
 
        As the lead melodist, Mozart’s execution was flawless. Not a note or beat was missed. However, the orchestra was not composed of her alone.

        There was a newly promoted melodist who was on her first mission. Despite being protected by the barrier formed by their music, she involuntarily faltered at the sight of the ferocious monster. Paralyzed by fear, she forgot to play, and without her part, the purifying melody became incomplete, thus weakening the barrier and causing a crack to form on its surface.

        The monster, of course, did not miss the opportune moment, launching relentless attacks on the crack. The new melodist, even more terrified by the escalating danger, froze completely. Her fear spread to the nearest melodists like ripples. Haydn, the conductor, immediately tightened his control over the orchestra by intensifying the tempo and stabilizing the other melodists, but he had no time to cover for the missing part left by the new melodist.

        ‘I have to do something, or everyone will be dead if that monster breaks through the barrier!’ Mozart, as the lead melodist, quickly noticed the problem, but she could not think of a solution on the spot. Then, she heard it—a melody rising above the chaos.

        ‘It’s Beethoven!’ Mozart instantly recognized the sound. ‘She’s altering her part… to cover the missing section!’  

        Beethoven skillfully rewrote her part on the spot to fill in the gap left by the new melodist. She seamlessly incorporated the missing section into her part, stabilizing the crumbling barrier while allowing the other melodists to collect themselves. Thanks to her improvisation, the purifying power returned to full strength, and together, the orchestra successfully sealed away the monstrous menace.

        “Thank you, Beethoven! ” The new melodist was the first to rush over, grabbing Beethoven’s hands with tearful gratitude. “I don’t know what we would’ve done without you!” 

        “Uh… it was… it was everyone’s effort…” Beethoven stammered, her voice barely louder than a whisper.

        “You’re being way too humble. If you hadn’t stepped in to fill the gap, that monster would’ve broken through our barrier!”

        “Yeah, exactly! Beethoven, you’re incredible!”

        Other melodists followed and gathered around Beethoven. Flustered by their enthusiastic praise, Beethoven scratched her cheek and gave them a sheepish smile.

        Mozart, however, did not join the crowd. She stood at a distance, silently watching the scene with a conflicted expression.

        Two melodists approached Mozart, their voices laced with bitterness as they said, “Hmph! What’s so great about her? She’s nothing without the miraculous instrument.”

        “Yeah, she’s just lucky, that’s all.”

        “If you two are so capable, why didn’t you step up and fill in for the missing part?” said Mozart with an icy tone.

        “It was a dire situation! It was already hard enough to keep playing our parts!” one of them retorted defensively. 
“Y-yeah! Besides, you didn’t step in to help either!”

        “You’re right—I didn’t. I couldn’t. That’s why what Beethoven did wasn’t luck—it was her skill.” Mozart’s voice was sharp, her words cutting. “Neither of you could have done what she did even if you had the miraculous instrument. If you really have complaints, make them heard with your musical talent like a true melodist.”

        Mozart’s words were not just aimed at the two melodists; they were a reminder to herself. Still, no amount of reason or self-reproach could fully suppress the jealousy burning in her heart.

        The next day, Haydn, the conductor of the Chelidonian Winds Orchestra, summoned Mozart for a private meeting.

        The gentleman hesitated for a moment as if searching for the right words to avoid wounding the pride of the proud melodist standing before him.

        “I’d like to have Beethoven be our lead melodist for the next performance,” Haydn finally cut to the chase, “It’s not that there’s anything wrong with your performance. I simply want to explore more possibilities and I hope you won’t overthink this.”

        Mozart remained silent. She seemed neither surprised nor flustered but utterly calm. “I understand. I’ll follow your decision.”

        Although Haydn attempted to reassure Mozart, she barely heard him. She nodded mechanically as her mind became adrift. Eventually, she excused herself and walked away, her thoughts clouded and unfocused. It was not until she passed by the instrument workshop that she stopped her aimless wandering.

        ‘That’s… Beethoven’s instrument…’ Mozart immediately recognized the miraculous instrument sitting inside. As if drawn by an invisible force, she walked into the workshop and approached the famed instrument everyone had spoken of with such reverence. The marks on the instrument’s surface told her all she needed to know.

        ‘These scratches… They’re from yesterday’s mission. Beethoven must have damaged it when she improvised on the spot. The additional part must have inflicted strain on the instrument, forcing her to bring it here for repairs.’

        Mozart could not help but reach out her hand toward the miraculous instrument, and an idea formed in her mind:

        ‘No one’s here right now… No one will know if I… No… I can’t… I shouldn’t…’

        “Mozart?” Beethoven’s voice snapped Mozart out of her dark thoughts. Startled, she turned to see Beethoven standing at the doorway, looking at her with concern.

        “You look awful,” Beethoven said, stepping closer. “Are you feeling unwell?”

        Beethoven was like a mirror that reflected everything Mozart lacked—her inadequacies, her insignificance. Mozart envied Beethoven’s talent, but even more so, she loathed how effortlessly Beethoven earned the admiration of everyone around her. With the feeling of jealousy coiling around her heart like a venomous serpent, she despised herself for being incompetent, unable to rid herself of this suffocating envy and pain.

        And now, Beethoven’s concern only deepened her wound, cutting like a blade. Like a glaring spotlight, the kindness in Beethoven’s eyes exposed the ugliness festering within her soul. Unable to face Beethoven’s gaze, Mozart shoved her away and fled the workshop, slamming the door behind her. She did not know where she was going; she only knew she needed to escape—escape from this place where she had almost done something unforgivable.

        While she ran, her breath became ragged, and her heart pounded like a drum. It was not until she ran out of breath that she finally stopped, leaning against a wall to steady herself.


        “You look like you’re in a lot of pain, my dear,” a sultry voice sounded. Mozart turned only to see a beautiful woman, gazing at her with a knowing look and an alluring smile.

        “...Maestra Paganini,” Mozart said, recognizing the woman immediately. It was Paganini, the conductor of the Rhapsody Orchestra and Haydn’s lover.

        “Mozart,” Paganini whispered, stepping closer. Her fingers tilted Mozart’s chin upward, her breath warm and intoxicating as it brushed against Mozart’s face. Her words numbed the young melodist’s aching heart. “Do you want to end your suffering?”

        “Come, Mozart. Join my orchestra,” she cooed, “Only by staying away from that girl will you find salvation.”

        Paganini’s words struck Mozart to her core. It was as if Paganini could see straight into the darkest corners of her heart, exposing her deepest fears and desires—the truths she had never dared to speak aloud.

        Mozart hesitated, her mind waging an agonizing battle. Slowly and inevitably, the scales in her heart tipped, and she finally made her decision—she placed her hand over Paganini’s, closing her eyes in silent agreement.

        She had no other choice. She could not reconcile with herself. No matter how hard she tried, the boundless sea of jealousy continued to drown her, and she could not free herself from its grip. And so, once again, she chose to run—to flee from the suffocating prison.

        She fled into the shadows, to a place where the light could no longer reach her, where no one could see the monstrous, twisted ugliness festering in her heart.</p>
