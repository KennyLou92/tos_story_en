        <h1>Ode to Fate - Beethoven</h1>
        <p>According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        Music had been everything to the Consonias from the moment of their birth; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        In the corridor of the preschool division of the Rotonda Music Academy, a group of young Consonias, around four to five years old, hopped energetically toward their practice rooms with their instruments in hand. Every one of them beamed with joy—except for one girl who trailed at the very back of the line with her instrument tightly held in her arms, lowering her head as much as possible as though attempting to erase her presence. 

        Unfortunately, things did not go as she planned.

        Two boys in the group quietly slipped to the rear of the line. One gave the girl a sudden push while the other snatched her instrument from her hands.

        “No!” the girl gasped, her timid voice barely more than a whisper as she looked at the dark-haired boy holding her instrument. “P-please... give it back,” she pleaded.

        “Not a chance!” the boy sneered and pulled a face at her before tossing the instrument to the brown-haired boy. “If you want it, come and get it.”

        “Please… give it back…” The girl stepped toward the brown-haired boy only to see him throw the instrument back to his friend, leaving her no choice but to spin helplessly between them. She desperately begged, “P-please stop… Don’t break it…”

        The girl’s face was filled with worry. Still, the boys showed no repentance for their actions. They continued to toss the instrument around, each toss narrowly avoiding a fall. The girl, growing more frantic, broke into a run in an attempt to catch it.

        “Ah!” The girl tripped in her haste and fell hard to the ground. Her knees scraped across the floor, and blood began trickling from her wounds. Tears streamed down her face as the pain overwhelmed her, and she wailed, “Why… Why do you have to bully me… Sob…”

        “Ugh, you’re just so annoying, Beethoven!” The dark-haired boy clicked his tongue in irritation. Glaring at her with disdain, he continued, “You’re born deaf—you don’t deserve to learn music. I don’t understand why you’re even allowed to attend school with us!”

        “I… I’m not deaf… I just can’t hear well in my left ear… My right ear is still fine… Sob…” The girl, Beethoven, protested weakly.

        “Who cares! Either way, you have no talent for music.” The boy flashed a malicious grin as he raised the instrument high and sneered, “You don’t even deserve to hold an instrument!” Just as he was about to smash it to the ground, a sudden force struck him from behind, sending him sprawling forward in a humiliating fall.

        The instrument flew into the air. However, instead of falling to the ground tragically, a slender figure gracefully caught it mid-air. She landed softly like an elegant bird descending from the sky, her movements mesmerizing everyone present.

        “W-why did you kick him?” the brown-haired boy shouted at the unexpected guest. It was a girl with budding beauty who looked slightly older than them.

        “Because he disrespected an instrument,” the girl replied, her gaze piercing and cold. Her voice carried a sharp disdain as she remarked, “How ridiculous that is for a member of the Consonias, a clan honoring the mission of spreading music across the universe, to steal another’s instrument and even attempt to destroy it.”

        “W-what are you talking about?” The dark-haired boy, obviously flustered, pointed at the frightened Beethoven and stammered, “It’s her fault! Her music is awful! I was just trying to put the instrument out of its misery!”

        “Her music is awful? So, you think hammering the keys like a dying ox gasping for breath, as you do during the final measures of your music, is any better?” the girl retorted sharply.

        “You—you— UGH!” The boy’s breath quickened as he felt humiliated. He lunged at the girl, gritting his teeth. Yet the girl remained unflinching. She calmly watched as he charged at her full speed and sidestepped his attack at the last moment, causing him to stumble and fall to the ground again.

        However, it did not end with just a humiliating fall this time. The girl stepped on the boy’s right hand before he could get up. She used the perfect amount of strength just enough to restrain his movement without actually hurting his bones.

        “You are a terrible musician who yet refuses to admit the truth, and instead of improving your skill with diligence, you bullied your peer and even tried to destroy her instrument…” The girl said as she slightly strengthened her foot on the boy’s hand, her beautiful countenance frigid as ice. “I don’t see much love for music from you. Perhaps I should simply destroy this hand of yours.”

        “N-no… No… Please don’t… I’m sorry! I was wrong… Waaaaah!” The boy finally broke down in fear and began wailing, begging for mercy.

        “Quiet,” the girl said in annoyance.

        The boy immediately quieted, and she continued, “Next time if I see you bullying anyone again, I won’t hesitate to break your hand. Now, get lost.”

        As soon as she withdrew her right foot, the boy frantically scrambled to his feet and fled with his friend.

        Here.” The girl handed the instrument back to Beethoven, who stared at her in awe. It was not until a moment later that she collected herself and held the instrument tightly in her arms. Her eyes sparkled with admiration as she exclaimed, “You… Y-you’re amazing!”

        “It’s nothing. Those boys pick on the weak. Just remember to stand up for yourself next time,” the girl advised.

        “No, I wasn’t talking about that… Oh! I mean, of course, what you did for me was amazing too, but your music is even more incredible!” Beethoven’s timid demeanor vanished as she spoke enthusiastically. “I know who you are. You’re Mozart, one of Maestro Haydn’s students! I’ve seen you play before in the practice room—your music is so colorful and beautiful just like… oh! Just like a rainbow reflected on a lake!

        “…What are you talking about?” Mozart asked, puzzled. “...You mean you can see my music?”

        She thought Beethoven must be telling some kind of joke but the girl nodded earnestly and said, “Yeah… Is that strange?”

        Mozart looked at Beethoven with a rather complicated expression. “No… Perhaps it’s a miracle.”

        Afterward, Mozart introduced Beethoven to her teacher, Haydn, and told him about what Beethoven had said to her. The renowned conductor was first astonished by Beethoven’s unique condition, but he quickly regained his composure. Together, he and Mozart tested Beethoven, and it turned out that this little girl held a rare talent—she could see the magical essence of music, a gift that no other Consonias in history had ever possessed and a blessing that seemed to compensate for the partial hearing loss in her left ear.

        To help this rare talent flourish, Haydn and Mozart began teaching Beethoven, instilling different kinds of musical knowledge into the little girl and ultimately fostering a young brilliant musician.

        Time passed. As years went by, Beethoven developed her own unique musical style—gentle and delicate—and eventually became a melodist. She even garnered wide recognition that allowed her to stand alongside Mozart, the most promising star of their clan.

        Even so, Beethoven never stopped holding Mozart in high regard, seeing her as the greatest melodist and herself as merely a shadow under the prodigy’s brilliance.

        One would expect that she might hold some resentment toward her supporting role, but it was quite the opposite; she embraced her role with excitement and genuinely hoped that she could perform alongside Mozart forever. However, life is unpredictable—the brilliance of the chosen cannot forever stay hidden, and no one can escape the destined future.

        One day, Beethoven and Mozart arrived at the Music Plaza for their usual rehearsal routine. Two entirely distinct melodies intertwined in the tranquil square, weaving an invisible breeze that circled in the air and touched the fluffy clouds before fading into an almost imperceptible silence and leaving a tantalizing trail.

        When the duet ended, the plaza fell quiet and only the sounds of nature remained. It was not after a moment that Beethoven, overcome with excitement, threw her arms around Mozart, her face alight with joy as she exclaimed, “This new piece is absolutely stunning! Mozart, you truly are a genius!”

        “There are still a few harmonies that need adjusting—”

        “It’s gonna be alright, Mozart! I know you’ll perfect them!” Beethoven released Mozart and turned her gaze toward the center of the plaza, where a bronze statue stood behind a peculiar instrument. 

        The instrument’s surface was suffused with an iridescent glow. It was a legendary instrument, said to perform miracles, crafted from pearly white bones that were remnants of a fallen Encanto Whale.

        The Encanto Whales were creatures born from the laughter of the joyous creator, Arwassa, during the primordial dragon era. Traversing the deep sea, these rare beasts carried the memories of countless beings and possessed the ability to visualize and conjure illusions from their emotions, which made their physical remains the most ideal materials for crafting instruments.

        The statue, on the other hand, was a memorial to an extraordinary melodist known as the Stella Melodist whose talent was as bright as the stars.

        In the distant past, a Maestro of Terror rampaged across the cosmos, spreading fear and causing catastrophic disasters wherever they went. Countless lives were lost during their destruction. In order to restore peace to the universe, the Stella Melodist used their miraculous instrument and finally subdued the great menace after numerous fierce battles

        The heroic story eventually became a legend, and to commemorate the Stella Melodist’s valiant deeds, the Consonias built a statue in their memory and placed the miraculous instrument that had become dormant after the loss of its master beside it, hoping someday another talented melodist would awaken its powers.

        “I have no doubt in you, Mozart. With your talent, you will surely become someone even greater than the Stella Melodist!” Beethoven said with utmost sincerity like the most devout believer.

        Her earnest words and expression brought a smile to Mozart’s face. With her lips curving slightly, she replied with a teasing lilt, “I’ll try my best, but you must also—”

        Mozart’s face instantly turned to horror before she could finish her words. In a split second, driven by instinct, she threw herself at Beethoven to shield her with her body.

        A massive figure hurtled toward the statue with unstoppable force, sending violent tremors throughout the Music Plaza upon the crash. The impact shattered the floor and pavilion into pieces, and the deafening crashes resounded one after another, echoing around the square for some time.

        “Ugh…”  Beethoven groaned as she clutched her throbbing head, dazed from the collision. When her vision cleared, she saw Mozart lying unconscious, her back marred by a gruesomely bleeding gash that was obviously left by that mysterious figure during its ferocious charge.

        “Mozart!” Beethoven cried out in panic. However, Mozart, gravely injured, simply could not respond to her call, and her face grew paler with each passing moment.

        ‘Mozart will bleed to death! I-I have to get her to a hospital!’ Beethoven thought desperately. She hoisted Mozart onto her rather petite frame and staggered forward. Yet, a feral roar froze her in her tracks after she had only taken a few steps.

        She turned back only to see a metallic wolf standing amidst the shattered remains of the statue. Its crimson eyes burned with murderous intent as it bared its teeth. Its claws scraped the ground, prepared to pounce. 

        ‘That… that’s a Terrion!’ Beethoven screamed inwardly.

        Terrions were minions created by the Maestro of Terror. After the death of the Maestro of Terror, the Terrions hid in the dark, waiting for opportunities to exact vengeance for their creator. The Terrion standing before Beethoven had likely mistook the statue in the plaza for the Stella Melodist due to their lingering presence on the miraculous instrument nearby, which resulted in its vengeful charge.

        Now that the Terrion’s bloodlust had been fully provoked by the shattered statue, it then turned toward the only two living beings present—Beethoven and Mozart.

        ‘No… I have to do something or both Mozart and I will be killed before we can escape…  But our instruments have been destroyed in the quake, and I can’t subdue it without music…’ While Beethoven thought frantically, her gaze landed on the miraculous instrument lying next to the Terrion. To her astonishment, there were faint rainbows swirling around the dormant instrument.

        ‘That light… The instrument is resonating…  It’s calling for a melodist… ‘ Beethoven took a deep breath and closed her eyes. She knew she had no other choice but to take the risk.

        After hiding Mozart behind a large piece of rubble, she dashed toward the Terrion. The wolf lunged at her, and she could only try to evade its attacks clumsily. The number of cuts and bruises on her skin increased as the chase continued. Despite blood dripping from her wounds, she pressed on.

        Just as she inched closer to the instrument, the Terrion struck again, this time with a cruel, playful swipe. Yet, by a twist of fate, its blow flung Beethoven directly to the miraculous instrument.

        The goal became within reach. Beethoven summoned the last vestiges of her strength and crawled toward it. She strenuously placed her bloodied hands on the keys. Her blood stained the instrument, adding a haunting beauty to its white surface.

        “Now…” Beethoven involuntarily murmured, her eyes staring blankly, as though guided by an invisible force. “Awaken and let your melody resound.”

        The Terrion, smelling danger, promptly lunged at her again, but it was too late. 

        Like streaking meteors, Beethoven’s fingers began moving across the keys in an incredible speed. A thunderous note reverberated through the air as she pressed a key, forming a pressure that poured down on the Terrion with the unimaginable weight of destiny. Yet, that was not all. The labyrinthine complexities of fate unfolded in her music, holding the wolf in place.

        Complicated notes, sharp as blades, materialized from her melody. Under her deft and powerful playing, the lethal blades plunged and severed the wolf’s limbs with precision. The turbulent rhythm surged like a tempest, battering the beast relentlessly. Finally, under an unyielding crescendo, the Terrion let out a final, harrowing shriek before it succumbed to her attacks, becoming a phantom in the abyss of fate.

        As the last note faded, the music settled into a profound stillness, as though every sound had found its rightful place. Beethoven, her spirit momentarily transcendent, reached out to the miraculous instrument before her.

        Her music seemed to have given the instrument a radiant glow of life. A beam of iridescent light emerged from the instrument and wrapped around her hand as if greeting her. Mysteriously, she felt an inexplicable connection between herself and the instrument.

        “...Thank you. I’ll cherish you,” Beethoven whispered. However, no sooner had she spoken than exhaustion claimed her and her mind slipped into darkness. By the time she awoke, it was three days later. She opened her eyes and saw Mozart, her wounds well bandaged, sitting by her bedside.

        “You’re finally awake,” said Mozart, her calm expression betraying a hint of relief. “You saved my life, thank you.”

        “Haha, it’s my honor,” Beethoven replied, her voice warm as she grasped Mozart’s hand. She gave her a gentle smile and said, “You’ve always helped me. I’m glad I could finally repay the favor.”

        Yet, little did they know what kind of cruel future awaited them…</p>
