        <h1>Firefist Monk</h1>
        <p>        After bidding farewell to the Butterfly, Emerald Monk decided to continue his journey with the Paladin for a while longer because of his curiosity about the latter’s obsession with the ancient ruins. On their way, the Paladin started several fierce fights to protect the ruins. Yet, his suicidal style of fighting always left him scarred. 

        ‘Is this worth it?’ asked Emerald Monk.

        ‘Humph, you don’t understand. Only by protecting the ruins can ancient knowledge be preserved for humanity in the future.’

        What the Paladin did not tell Emerald Monk was that he often saw those ancient memories hidden in the armor. The power and wealth of the ancient civilizations he saw inside became his yearning which eventually turned into fixation…

        One day, Emerald Monk and the Paladin found a crumbling ruin occupied by a powerful beast. Almost all the stone pillars and structures of the ruin were destroyed.

        Emerald Monk, who sensed the beast’s powerfulness, was about to give the Paladin a heads-up, only to find that the latter had already drawn his bow and shot a wind-breaking arrow at the beast furiously.

        The arrow thrust into the beast's body yet it didn’t injure it fatally. As the stab of pain drove the beast mad, it galloped towards the Paladin and Emerald Monk with a growl.

        ‘Run!’ Emerald Monk warned the Paladin. Unexpectedly, the latter showed no intention of escaping even in the face of the hurtling beast. Instead, he anchored his bow again and aimed at it while channeling a huge power onto the tip of his arrow.

        At that moment, countless thoughts flashed across Emerald Monk’s mind.

        Along the way, Emerald Monk had gradually felt envy at the Paladin’s preoccupation. In the past, golems were made to protect the Enochian Tower. Yet, now with the tower being split into two, the golems also lost their meaning of life. That was why he still felt envious even though he knew that the Paladin had gone too far with his fixation…

        Just when the beast was about to pounce on them——

        Daringly, Emerald Monk grabbed the racing beast’s body with both his hands. The beast dragged him across the ground with its great strength, producing flying sparks along the way.

        ‘You’ll only stop the transmission of knowledge if you die from your obsession with protecting the past! No matter how powerful and prosperous the ancient civilizations were, they hold no meaning if there is no one to pass them on!’ Emerald Monk scolded the Paladin.

        The flying sparks and Emerald Monk’s words awaken the delusional Paladin. It was only until then did the Paladin realize that he was not protecting the ruins for the humans but chasing after an illusion all along.

        The Paladin was no longer fixated on killing the beast; he chose to fight together with Emerald Monk while luring the beast into a deep pit nearby. The two then retreated after the beast had fallen into their trap.

        The words of Emerald Monk made the Paladin realize the importance of inheritance, and thus he no longer risked his life to protect the ruins on their further journey...</p>
