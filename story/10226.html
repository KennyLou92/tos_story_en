        <h1>Chalice System: Avalon</h1>
        <p>
        A medical and combat system that has existed since the days of yore. The system pierces its patient with a huge key-shaped medical instrument to immobilize their body and soul, then uses its many interior arms to treat them.
One day, Avalon found an unconscious young girl and took her in for treatment. Once awake, the girl's immature ego could not differentiate between her body and the Avalon system, becoming one with Avalon. Sensing the girl's anxiety toward the strangers that sent her into a coma, Avalon activated its armament systems to eliminate those that would stand in her way.</p>
