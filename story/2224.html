        Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 9

        Inside an isolated country, there nurtured a special sort of elves. The species was called minerelf, for their body structure consisted of jewels. The nation gradually thrived under the king’s rule, and this story began at the thriving age…

        A young girl Obsidian stormed through into the hallway of Minerelf Girls’ School, scaring off the students nearby to step back.

        None standing in the way, Obsidian came to the destination smoothly——Principal’s Office.  Taking a deep breath to suppress her anger, she knocked on the door.

        Knock knock!

        “Principal, I’m Obsidian, Chairladyman of Student Association.  I have something to discuss with you in person.”

        “Hold...Hold on!  Obsidian, wait——!” Despite the principal’s flustered response, Obsidian opened the door directly——Wearing lovely pajamas, the principal looked at her in dismay; both actions were frozen.

        “AhemCough!” The principal pretended that nothing had happened, put on his her coat to cover the pajamas inside and went back to the principal’s seat.  “Obsidian, how can I help you?” The principal gazed at her sharply as she placed her palms together.

        “Principal, please drop Ruby out of the school,” she requested agitatedly.

        “This is a serious accusation.  Your reason is?”

        “She has been harassing other students frequently, resulting in great nuisances.  To be fair, such punishment is inevitable.”

        “Sigh...Indeed, sometimes Ruby has gone too far.  But she did not hurt anyone, didn’t she?”

        “So we just let it be?”

        “School is a place of education.  If students all get expelled once they do things wrong, it’ll be against the meaning of education.  Therefore, I’m not gonna drop her out for the moment.”

        Obsidian beat the desk hard angrily.  “You’re just covering her up!”

        As the words slipped out, Obsidian regretted.  She knew she had provoked the principal, who then hid his her lenient side and started putting on a cold face.

        “Obsidian, your effort into the school is understandable.  However, making rash accusation purely out of your anger is not appropriate.”

        “Sorry, I lost my manners.” Obsidian apologized in awe.

        “I accept your apology,” smiled the principal.  “This is education, you understand?  As the Chairladyman of Student Association, I hope you can set an example to Ruby.”

        “An example...Right, as the Chairladyman of Student Association, I should supervise her misconduct.  Thank you, principal.  Even if I have to sacrifice, I’ll complete this mission!”

        “Urh...that’s too muchis is scary.”

        “For the sake of the school, I fear nothing!” Obsidian was enlightened and full of energy.  Overwhelmed by her over reaction, the principal forced a smile.  “Try your best then.”

        Obsidian left after making a salute.

        “Phew, just like a storm passing by——”

        “Oh, I almost forgot.  Your pajamas are cute, principal.” Obsidian opened the door again and praised loud enough to spread through the entire hallway, which had sent the principal into flurry.   Leaving proudlyObviously, Obsidian had obviously no clue that what she did was embarrassing the principal and left proudly.

        “Better start off today.  Now I’m gonna lecture Ruby myself!” Obsidian immediately headed to Ruby’s classroom.  Given that no one responded after knocking on the door, she went in directly, but shocked by the mess inside.

        “This is ridiculously messy…” Obsidian pulled up her sleeves.  “Alright, during my wait for her, let me tidy clean up the mess.”

        Then, Obsidian started sweeping the classroom.  During which, that elf came in——

        “Obsidian, what are you doing here?” Ruby was amazed by the neat and clean classroom.  “I knew it!  You’re trying to get revengeto revenge by throwing my research away, aren’t you!”

        “What are you talking about.  I was just cleaning up the rubbish!”

        “What!  You said my research is rubbish…” Ruby, flying into a fury, triggered element to prepare for a battle.  “Apologize!  You cunning elf!”

        Ruby’s nonsense had collapsed Obsidian’s sanity.  Circulating power, she pulled out a sharp sword made of its mineral from her arm and retorted.  “You unreasonable elf...Apologize to me!”

        The fuse between them would soon be exploded!</p>
