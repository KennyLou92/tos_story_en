        <h1>Voracious Thirst - Ruslan</h1>
        <p>
        A citizen of the United States of Asgard, a nation located on the northern Tarones. He was a tycoon before he was imprisoned in the prison of the Court of International Justice for serious charges.

Driven by his obsession with power, he spent all his wealth seeking a golden liquid that could mechanize his body. He gained immense power after consuming the liquid but suffered severe side effects: he had to constantly devour other living beings to maintain his power, which led to the slaughter of over a hundred people.

Although he can utilize the powers of those he devours, he is incapable of replicating the strength of the original users.</p>
