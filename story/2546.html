        <h1>Axe of Doom - Beowulf</h1>
        <p>        After Scrubia had awakened Beowulf, they went on a journey to find the cure for her nightmare. At last, they found Idun and learned the cause of Scrubia’s nightmare from her—the faint dragon soul in Scrubia was a part of Nidhogg.

        Idun wasn’t able to remove it, while Beowulf and Scrubia weren’t strong enough to climb up the Enochian Tower where Nidhogg was. So they looked around for the clues about the dragon soul instead.

        One day, they went into the woods after hearing about a relic of a primordial dragon there. By the time they arrived, it was already sundown so they stopped at a village nearby for the night.

        Sitting on the side of the bed, Beowulf watched Scrubia sleep—he had gotten used to it—so that she would have someone on her side when she woke up from the nightmare, the same nightmare that caused her suffering over the years.

        Under the slightly pale moonlight, Beowulf ran his fingers through Scrubia’s hair gently. The power of the dragon soul resonated through the ends of her hair, bringing him peace of mind as usual.

        However, that tranquillity was soon shattered—Beowulf felt a sudden commotion in his chest with a sense of searing heat sweeping over him!

        “I’ve found it! The one I’ve been looking for… is right outside! Right at my fingertips!”

        Beowulf had no idea what he was looking for but his body stood up involuntarily as if it was controlled by another mind. Then he walked out of the hotel and ran towards the woods, leaving Scrubia and the fallen chair behind.

        Following his instinct, he kept running forward against the cutting leaves and the spiky thorns, as if he was chasing a lost soul.

        As the sense of searing heat grew stronger, he knew that he was getting closer to what he desired. Eventually, he saw it—a slender and graceful figure in the moonlight standing among the ruins at the end of the woods.

        As white as the first snowfall, her long hair fluttered in the breeze with a touch of forlorn solitude that was yet thriving tenaciously in the crack amongst the debris of decay.

        Solely with her presence, that woman brought life to these dilapidated ruins which went beyond the description of beauty or hideousness.

        Beowulf’s chest rose and fell vigorously; scalding tears fell from his eyes uncontrollably, just like a returned prodigal son and a lost child that finally found his way home.

        However, he didn’t dare to make a sound nor move, worried that even his breath would break this moment so he could hold his breath strenuously.
　　
        Still, the woman found him. As she turned her face, her azure eyes slightly widened when she saw Beowulf. She seemed surprised, yet soon composed. All her emotions eventually turned into light words.

        ‘It’’s you…’

        ‘It’s me…’ With tears rolling down his face, Beowulf dropped to his knees and held his hand palm-up as though he was trying to grasp or embrace something. Then he murmured like a mad man, ‘I’ve found you… I’ve finally found you… My dearest—— No, that isn’t me… I… Who am I…’

        A flood of memories flashed across Beowulf’s mind——

        A golden figure flew across the boundless universe. With a swing of its tail, it left a trace on the cosmic canvas, followed by stardust gathering on it. Closing its eyes, it then raised its hands and shaped the stardust. In a flash, a flat planet was formed. As it stretched its body and circled the asteroid, greenery spurted on the planet.

        Beowulf was fascinated by that creature’s picturesque posture, yet soon someone broke his thought——

        ‘The corrupt warriors! Are you here for your judgment?’ Accompanied by Tyr’s interrogation, his long sword was shattered into pieces… That scene of Gods holding their swords against him because of the demonic blood jolted his hatred for them.

        However, another voice emerged and invaded his mind, with mounting anger that turned into a dragon growl—just like the one of Nidhogg—‘ROARRR——!’

        The crisscrossing memories bewildered Beowulf, nearly ripping his mind into shreds.

        “His body and mind are too fragile and weak that he still can’t beat such a transcendent existence even though that is just one piece in a million…” At long last, the woman stretched her hand to Beowulf after a while of ponderation——</p>
