        <h1>Imperious Command - Boreas</h1>
        <p>        It was a weekend evening in Olympus, the capital city of Odyssey, the mother planet of the Holy Gods. On this perfect night for an extravagant feast, numerous elegantly dressed Holy Gods gathered in the grand banquet hall to celebrate the transition to adulthood of the grandchildren of the twelfth major god.

        All the guests were either of wealth or high social status, including high-ranking military officials, prominent heirs of wealthy merchants, or renowned scholars, each with numerous accomplishments and achievements.

        Everyone mingled with each other with wine glasses in their hands and perfect smiles on their faces, trying to establish connections that would pave the way for their future and aspirations.

        Suddenly, the banquet hall doors swung open, and a tall, robust man in military attire strode in. The man was not conventionally handsome, but his rugged and primal charm exuded an irresistible allure.

        His name was Boreas, one of the twelve major gods who commanded the Sorcery Corps. Just last month, he became engaged to the daughter of the Queen of Gods, which further raised his prestige in addition to his influential family background.

        “Boreas, you finally came. We’ve been waiting for you,” a well-dressed gentleman approached Boreas, his smile fawningly warm and enthusiastic.

        “I came right after I finished my military duties. By the way…” Boreas’ lips curled as he cast a  contemptuous glance at the gentleman and asked, “Who are you?”

        Boreas’ question stirred a wave of whispers among the gods around, followed by derisive gazes directed at the gentleman. The feeling of public humiliation turned the man’s face pale. Nevertheless, he maintained his composure and forced a strained smile, attempting to defuse the situation. “You’re funny, Boreas. You were just at our winery yesterday finalizing the contract for next year’s red wine supply, remember?”

        “I have no recollection of that. My time is too precious for such trivial matters,” Boreas glanced at the gentleman who still stood in his way. Furrowing his brow in displeasure, he said, “You’re in my way. Move.”

        “You—” The gentleman was about to retort but another young man stopped me. Gritting his teeth in frustration, the gentleman reluctantly stepped back and hastily left the banquet.

        As soon as the unimportant gods were gone, Boreas could finally go to a dining table. There, he picked up a glass of red wine and drank it down heartily.

        Suddenly, his body tensed but soon relaxed as an alluring fragrance reached his nostrils. Then, he felt a warm and tender touch on his back—it was a woman pressing her body against his back, her beautiful face inching forward from his shoulder. With a mischievous spark in her eyes, she coyly said, “Oh, Boreas, your temper remains as fiery as ever.”

        After Boreas finished his wine in one gulp, he placed the glass down and turned to put his arms around the woman intimately, burying his face in her shoulder in the public gaze.

        “And you’re still as beautiful as ever, Aphrodite.”

        “Haha, you’re sweet,” Aphrodite giggled sweetly. Although Aphrodite seemed gentle and harmless on first impression, she was actually one of the twelve major gods and a marshal who was more ruthless and manipulative than Boreas.

        “You just caught me after having some candy. Would you like a taste?” Boreas asked while licking his lips suggestively.

        “The audacity. Aren’t you afraid your fiancée might see? She’s here today, look, standing by the window over there,” Aphrodite said. Yet, contrary to her words, she pressed her body even closer to Boreas, seemingly unconcerned about the presence of his fiancée.

        Boreas lifted his gaze and saw a meticulously dressed blonde woman standing reservedly by the window. Her exquisite face displayed impatience, suggesting her resignation from attending this banquet.

        The woman was named Nesoi. She was the daughter of the Queen of Gods, and she possessed strength that befitted her prestigious title, serving as Boreas’ vice commander in the Sorcery Corps. She was betrothed to Boreas by her mother, Semele’s arrangement to gather influence and consolidate her power.

        “Everyone knows that our betrothal exists in name only. She doesn’t care about me; she probably wishes I’d stay away from her,” Boreas remarked.

        “So she is a rigid princess. What a shame. Her beautiful face would surely glow if she were to fall in love,” Aphrodite said.

        “Her, falling in love?”  Boreas tried to imagine Nesoi falling head over heels for someone, but he failed to envision it. “That’s highly unlikely.”

        “Ha, who knows? Love isn’t something one can predict or resist. Even Athena fell for a mortal man, remember?” Aphrodite remarked.

        “You’re such a romantic,” Boreas responded dismissively, tightening his grip and pulling her closer. With a mischievous smile tugging at the corners of his mouth, he continued, “Let’s not waste our time on those elusive notions of love. Come, let’s enjoy ourselves.”

        “True, love is too much for us. We just need momentary happiness,” Aphrodite replied, returning Boreas’ embrace. Together, they enjoyed themselves at the banquet, savoring the exquisite food and wine, while gracefully handling the flattery that came their way.

        After reveling for a while, Boreas began to feel a slight dizziness in his head. So, he pushed Aphrodite away and left the hall, stepping into the garden.

        As soon as Boreas stepped outside, a gust of wind blew over him, instantly clearing his clouded mind and sharpening his senses. He faintly heard some voices, the murmurs of a conversation.

        ‘That’s… A man and a woman are talking… The woman’s voice sounds familiar…’ Boreas closed his eyes, focusing on the sound. After a moment, he recognized the voice. ‘It’s Nesoi… Who is she talking to?’

        Driven by curiosity, Boreas stealthily made his way toward the source of the voices. And there, he witnessed a spectacle that left him stunned—Nesoi was engaged in a passionate kiss with a man.

        The princess, who had always been cold and obstinate, never showing weakness or vulnerability, was now standing within a man’s arms, succumbing to his dominant kisses.

        Her pale skin was tinged with a rosy flush, and her indifferent gaze transformed into a tender one, shimmering with affection, looking nothing alike the usual fierce princess who was sometimes even more assertive than men. At that moment, she was merely a woman deeply in love.

        Mesmerized by the unexpected sight of Nesoi’s vulnerable side, Boreas continued to spy on his fiancée’s secret rendezvous with another man while his heart accelerated with each beat. He remained hidden, watching the two’s intimate interaction until they left.

        ‘So, she does fall in love… I didn’t know she would have that look on her face…’ Boreas mused. A hint of infatuation sprouted in his thoughts as he recalled Nesoi’s demeanor, causing a possessive desire to surface in his eyes.

        ‘I always get what I want, and I will make her mine!’</p>
