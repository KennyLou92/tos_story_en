        <h1>Burning Dukkha - Agni</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.2

        In the grand palace of Sinha, Agni hurriedly walked along the corridor and shortly he arrived at the King’s study. He took a moment to compose himself before gently knocking on the door. It was only after the man inside the study gave permission that Agni cautiously pushed open the door. He then kneeled before the man dressed in extravagant clothing. Respectfully, he asked, “Your Majesty, may I ask why you summoned me?”

        “Have you found that guy named Shiva yet?” the king of Sinha, Varuna, said while picking up a coral instrument, a trophy of his recent triumph over the war against the blue-skinned tribe days ago. However, one of the blue-skinned men, named Shiva, hit Varuna in his thigh during the war and unexpectedly cured his congenital insensitivity to pain. 

        The first experience of pain struck fear into the heart of Varuna; the invincible king was no longer fearless. For such reasons, Varuna harbored deep resentment toward Shiva and swore to capture him alive, and Agni was the officer responsible for the task.

        “...I am sorry, Your Majesty, but we haven’t found him yet.”

        Crash! Varuna violently hurled the instrument at Agni. The instrument shattered upon impact. “Tut! Useless! Days have passed, and yet you haven’t managed to find him. How dare you come back to see me!”

        “I am truly sorry! I have dispatched more personnel to search for him, and I believe we will soon apprehend him!” Agni, who felt Varuna’s wrath, quickly prostrated himself on the ground and begged for forgiveness.

        “Soon you said… All of you just keep using the same excuses—”

        Knock, knock! A knock on the door interrupted Varuna’s complaints. Then, a refined male voice sounded outside the door, “Your Majesty, it’s Brahma. May I request an audience?”

        “Brahma? Come right in.” Varuna’s grim expression brightened as soon as he heard Brahma’s voice. He promptly welcomed Brahma into the study, his demeanor completely different from the one he had shown toward Agni.

        That was because Brahma had restored Varuna’s insensitivity to pain by closing the chakras in his body that Shiva had accidentally opened. The disappearance of pain delighted Varuna, which was why he treated Brahma with utmost reverence.

        Brahma entered the study, but he paused upon seeing Agni prostrated on the ground. Puzzled, he asked with a smile, “Did... I interrupt something?”

        “No, you interrupted nothing,” Varuna reassured Brahma with a friendly gaze. Then, he turned his gaze on Agni and kicked him in the back with his foot while shouting angrily, “Get up! Get out now and bring that man back to me!”

        “...Yes, Your Majesty,” Agni replied and hurriedly stood up. He passed by Brahma as he made his way toward the door. An overwhelming wave of jealousy and resentment washed over him when he caught a glimpse of Varuna happily engaged in conversation with Brahma, the final straw that caused his pent-up anger to erupt. His fixed Brahma with a bitter gaze filled with hatred as he reluctantly left the study.

        “It’s all that guy’s fault! Brahma! The moment he appeared, he stole His Majesty’s trust and reliance on me. He will eventually replace me someday if this continues, and then I’ll lose my power… I have to get rid of him!”

        In the mysterious workings of fate, one of Agni’s subordinates reported a sighting of Kubera, a merchant known to be friendly with Brahma, near the border when he returned to the command room.

        ‘Near the border? That’s suspicious. Perhaps I can find some leverage against Brahma there,’ Agni grew excited the more he pondered. ‘I must go and find out his secret!’

        So, Agni ventured alone to the border. Unfortunately, he did not find any useful clues despite his thorough search. Just as he was about to give up and return to the palace, he heard footsteps coming from below. He quickly hid behind a large boulder, quietly peering out from the shadows to see who the comers were.

        Agni’s eyes widened in astonishment as a blue-skinned man emerged from the mountain path below a moment later. Then, an exultant smile spread over his face.

        ‘Though I couldn’t find Brahma’s secret, I’ve found the man Vuruna wants. What a delightful surprise,’ Agni thought to himself as he observed the man, Shiva, accompanied by a woman whose name was Parvati. Strangely, the woman appeared injured as she weakly leaned against Shiva’s back.

        ‘Perfect. The woman has all his attention, and he seems less vigilant than he used to be. What a perfect moment for an ambush!’ Agni tensed his muscles and grabbed the boulder in front of him, which was twice his size. Summoning every ounce of his strength, he hoisted the boulder and hurled it toward Shiva.

        By the time Shiva noticed the flying boulder, it was too late for him to evade. He had no choice but to set Parvati down and open his chakras to strengthen his body with an intense burst of prana. Then, he leaped into the air and swung a punch to the boulder—

        Boom! The boulder shattered upon impact in mid-air. However, it was only the beginning of Agni’s plan, who had been lying in wait behind another boulder, waiting for the opportune moment to strike. With his hands clenched into a fist, he abruptly charged at Shiva. However, unfazed by his sudden attack, Shiva raised his knee to block the punch while placing both his hands on Agni’s shoulder and chest.

        An invisible energy flowed into Agni’s body and neutralized the strength he had summoned, making his punch weak. Finally, he helplessly tumbled to the ground after Shiva gave him a gentle kick that sent him into the distance. Severely wounded, he could only lie on the ground, looking at the blue-skinned man in front of him.

        “It’s you again… Shiha soldier…” Shiva looked down at Agni. His eyes narrowed as he noticed the emblem of Sinha on Agni’s clothes. With a sharp glint appearing in his eyes, he said, “Apparently, killing my people wasn’t enough for you since you have come here to capture me. It seems you people don’t know how to give up unless I give you a lesson… Very well, let’s start with you.”

        Shiva’s murderous intent made Agni realize that his life was hung by a thread. The instinct for survival drove him to search for hope, and he did find one—the woman, Parvati, who had been lying on the ground nearby.

        To prevent Shiva from noticing his plan, Agni suppressed his smile and lowered his head, pretending to be defeated while scooping up a handful of sand from the ground. The moment Shiva stepped toward him to give him the final blow, he abruptly raised his head and scattered the sand over Shiva’s eyes.
　
        “Ugh!” Agni’s unexpected assault momentarily blinded Shiva, creating an opportunity for him to run toward Parvati. By the time Shiva regained his vision, Agni had held Parvati hostage with a pocket knife pressed against her vulnerable neck.

        Some days ago, Parvati had opened her seven chakras to save Shiva. However, the exhaustion of power left her in a weakened, nearly unconscious state, which was why she failed to break free from Agni’s overpowering grasp.

        “Do as I say if you don’t want this woman dead!” 

        “You—” Shiva glared at Agni, his chest heaving vigorously with fury. Unexpectedly, he reluctantly closed his eyes. Raising his hands in surrender, he said, “Let her go, and I’ll go with you.”

        Parvati, weakly gasping for breath, pleaded, “No… Shiva… just go… now…”

        “It’s okay, Parvati. I will come back for you,” Shiva reassured her, offering a tender smile. She had no choice but to agree to his plan with tears in her eyes.

        “Aww, how touching,” Agni scoffed coldly, “Unfortunately, that won’t work on me. Now hurry up!”

        Agni, knowing that he was no match for Shiva, believed it would be unwise to keep him awake. So, he swiftly rendered Shiva unconscious with a hand chop after instructing him to walk closer. Only then did he release his grip on Parvati and carry the unconscious Shiva away.

        “Great! Now I just have to present Shiva to Varuna, and then I will regain his trust!”</p>
