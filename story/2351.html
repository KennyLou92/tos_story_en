        <h1>Maes Hughes</h1>
        <p>A soldier. His rank is lieutenant colonel, and he works at the Central Headquarters Investigations Office. 

Very much devoted to his family, and none can brag about their wife and daughter like he can. 

He may come across as a dunce, but he is a quick thinker. He is also a busybody who cannot leave people in distress. 

An old friend and comrade of Roy who always supported his ambitions. However, he soon notices the homunculi's plot that involves the military, and as a result loses his life to Envy, disguised as his loving wife Gracia.
