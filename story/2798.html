        <h1>Flaring Masquerade - Medea</h1>
        <p>
                In the sheet of flames, Medea was weeping tears alone with a headless corpse in her arms. To mollify her in the depths of despair, the elements created an illusion in which she made another choice and lived a different life…

        Jason won the martial arts tournament and earned the eligibility to marry the princess, Medea. However, the king forcibly imprisoned Jason lest his royal bloodline was contaminated by a peasant. In order to save her lover, Medea planned on a jailbreak, only to be intercepted by the prince, her elder brother.

        ‘Medea Sarmatia!’

        ‘Brother?’

        ‘You really think that you can solve the problem by running away?’ the prince asked coldly.

        ‘Get out of my way!’ Medea uttered a threat to him through clenched teeth, ‘I won’t hold back even if you’re my brother!’

        In order to stop Medea, the prince turned himself into a centaur with the animal morphing magic and charged at her. After a while of tussling, the prince began to be disadvantaged by the unequal powers between him and his sister. Just when Medea was about to throw a fireball at him——

        “After all, he is still my brother by birth. Should I really kill him for love—for Jason?” Medea’s attack paused for a second at such thought. Seizing the moment of advantage, the prince trapped her with magic.

        ‘Dang it! Let go of me!’ Medea struggled in desperation, but to no avail, so she looked at Jason, who was standing aside, and called for help, ‘Jason! Save me!’

        However, instead of helping Medea, the man who had exchanged vows with her just a moment ago wore an awkward expression on his face.

        ‘...I’m sorry, Medea, but I don’t want to die yet.’ Leaving those words, Jason turned around and ran away without a backward glance. At that moment, Medea felt the flames of her dignity had been quenched by cold water along with a biting chill running through her whole body as if she had fallen to the glacier.

        Deeply traumatized, Medea barely had any memory of the things that happened after that, but only a vague one of her brother taking her back to the castle and the enraged king locking her up in the room. Under the king’s order, she was betrothed to the prince of the neighboring kingdom shortly thereafter.

        It was only until the day of Medea’s wedding when she put on an exquisite wedding dress that she truly realized a fact.

        “I have been betrayed and abandoned by my brother, my father, and my lover who said he loved me.” Medea let out a soft sneer. Then she burst into hysterical laughter and lost herself as though she had fallen into utter madness. Due to her indecency, the wedding was put off and she was sent directly to the prince’s bedroom.

        That night, when the prince of the neighboring kingdom came to the room to copulate with her, she did not resist. She just let him play with her body on the bed like a lifeless doll, which bored the prince and resulted in him leaving her for amusement somewhere else.

        Medea’s heart completely sank; even the emotional abuse from her husband could not send a ripple through her. She simply sat by the window and watched as the days went by.

        The maid who followed Medea to the neighboring kingdom could not bear to watch the princess suffer from chronic depression, so she suggested that Medea go out and get some fresh air during the town’s festival.

        “The festival… Right, the first time I met Jason was at the festival…” The sweet memories of the past slightly enlivened Medea. After a short hesitation, she accepted the maid’s suggestion, changed her clothes, and went to the town, roaming around the bustling streets alone.

        Suddenly, someone gripped Medea hard by the wrist. She tried to break away, but her body froze when she heard that familiar voice.

        ‘Medea! I… I finally found you!’ Even though it had been years since the last time the two saw each other, Jason’s face still looked attractive. The traces of time only served to make him more charming and magnetic than before, which gave Medea a bitter-sweet ache in her heart.

        However, rage passed through her body when she recalled the sight of him leaving her alone and fleeing. Hence, she raised her other hand and gave him a sharp slap with so much strength that even stung her palm.

        ‘How dare you show your face to me again!’ Medea said with a heavy note of sarcasm, turning a frigid gaze on him.

        ‘I was wrong!’ Jason did not slacken his grip on Medea’s hand despite the slap but only tightened it. With guilt and remorse shimmering in his deep eyes, he looked perfectly genuine and he said, ‘I was too weak back then. I was afraid that I would be executed if the prince caught me and that would mean I could never see you again!’

        Jason’s word melted Medea’s heart. The churning agony and regret in her heart made her lost for words. She only began to speak after a while with a softer tone, ‘...What's done is done. We can never go back to the way we used to be, so I don’t want to see you again. Let me go.’

        ‘No, I won’t!’ Jason could tell that Medea was wavering, so he forcibly drew Medea into her arms and held her tightly.

        ‘What are you doing?!’ Flushing with embarrassment and anger, Medea raised her hand as if to cast a magic spell. ‘I will burn you to ashes!’

        ‘Then burn me! I’ll gladly take the punishment if that makes you happy!’

        ‘You——’

        ‘I love you, Medea.’ Jason looked Medea deeply in the eye. Tears fell off his eyes that were brimming with great affection.

        Medea could not help but indulge herself in his eyes. She knew that she lost again—she lost to love again. She rested her head on Jason’s shoulder; her tears wetted his clothes. Then she whispered with a choked sob, ‘Don’t… leave me again this time…’

        Jason’s vehement confession rekindled their love and the two began to meet secretly in the town. With the nourishment of love, Medea regained the confidence and grace she had had as the “Kolchis” in the past.

        Unfortunately, no secret can remain hidden forever. Their love affair eventually reached the prince’s ears, and they were caught on the spot in one of their secret meetings.

        ‘How dare you cheat on me! Catch this tramp for me!’ The prince commanded the soldiers bitterly to besiege Medea and Jason.

        Just when Medea was racking her brain to find a way to break away, out of the blue, Jason pushed her toward the soldiers. Her left eye coincidentally hit the sword of a soldier and blood splattered. While everyone was stunned by this accident, Jason took the opportunity to run out of the door.

        “You made a promise that you wouldn’t leave me again… Jason... How many times are you going to lie to me… So all those words of love were nothing but a lie?” Covering her bleeding right eye, Medea curled her lips and let out a short laugh, then she exploded with hysterical laughter again just like the time she did at her wedding.

        “I won’t let you get away this time!”

        Putting a hand on her left chest, Medea summoned a fire drakon at the expense of her own heart. As the drakon spewed inextinguishable flames, the fire immediately spread across the land and engulfed everything, including the building, the soldiers and the prince, turning all of them into ephemeral blossoms of bright flares.

        ‘What a loathsome world. I shall burn it all down and purge all the betrayals and pains…’ Leaning against a wall, Medea looked up at the sky that had turned an apocalyptic shade of red because of the fire, then she slowly closed her eyes…

        “It is impossible for people to detach themselves from others as long as they are alive, and one should never contemn others for their own desire.”</p>
