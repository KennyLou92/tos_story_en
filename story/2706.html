        <h1>KAMEN RIDER SABER</h1>
        <p>
        Once upon a time, the world was formed by an omnipotent “book”. The book, written about an origin of myth, narratives, biology, technology, and human history, was what the Sword of Logos had been preserving. The soldiers had been designated by saint sabers and the world was at peace in secrecy. However, one day, a villain attempts to steal the book and a battle between the villain and the Swords of Logos begins. The book has dispersed and it brings an epic fight lasting at this moment in time.

Kamen Rider Saber is transformed by Touma Kamiyama using the Seiken Swordriver and the Brave Dragon Wonder Ride Book​.</p>
