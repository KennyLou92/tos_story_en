        <h1>Light Chaser - Lancelot</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.4

        After Lancelot accidentally injured Arthur under Morgan le Fay’s control, he followed Morgan le Fay back to the palace. As Gawain sneaked into the palace with his crew to steal the Star Stone, he met Lancelot on his way. He awakened Lancelot’s will during the fight that helped the latter get rid of Morgan le Fay’s manipulation.

        Gawain and Lancelot wanted to retrieve the Excalibur yet they were chased by battalions of soldiers armed with dark metal. Gawain stayed behind so that Lancelot could break through. Without further hesitation, Lancelot ran to the palace’s interior.

        “Where the hell did Mordred go?” Clueless, Lancelot could only walk from room to room. Suddenly, a searing heat arose in front of his chest, as if it sensed his trouble. He took out the thing in his pocket-it was the Star Stone. Arthur entrusted one of the Star Stones to Lancelot. He had kept it in an inside pocket of his clothes since then. Luckily, Morgan le Fay did not find out.

        “The Star Stone is glowing… Tristan must have gotten the other Star Stone and awakened it. King Uther once said the awakened Star Stones will be drawn to the Excalibur for return… Let me give it a try.”

        Lancelot moved while observing the Star Stone. Its radiance changed as expected. So he followed the Star Stone’s guidance and soon arrived at the palace hall.

        “The Excalibur is right inside...” Lancelot pushed the gate open and saw Mordred sitting proudly on the throne on the top of the stairway in the hall. As the Mordred caught sight of Lancelot, he frowned, 'You’re awakened. What happened to Mother? How could she let a pawn get out of her control? '

        'She died.' Lancelot thought his words could waver Mordred but, contrary to his expectation, Mordred simply pursed his lips and said with a hint of disgust on his face, 'She’s too weak. Not only she couldn’t keep her pawn under control, she even got killed by it.'
　　
        'Are you still a human?! Your mother died helping you! Not only you don’t feel sorry about it, now you’re despising her for her vulnerability!?'

        'Is humanity helpful for a king?' Mordred said indifferently, 'I’m the destined king and I shall eradicate whoever interferes with my kingship.'

        'You don’t deserve to touch the Excalibur! Give it back!' Lancelot roared in anger.

        'Humph. What an overweening guy. I’ll let you know how inferior you are.' As Mordred drew another long sword from his waist, he strode down from the throne and slashed at Lancelot fiercely.

        Every move of Mordred was in absolute precision, neat and decisive. His sword was strong and skilled. On the contrary,         Lancelot with an injured right hand was rather ragged that every defense he made seemed like an impending crisis.

        As time went by, the scratches on Lancelot’s body increased with blood oozing from the wounds, leaving crimson bloodstains on the floor.

        Seeing that, Mordred began to gloat. For the young man’s inflating vanity, he couldn’t help but bawled, 'The strongest knight of the Juvenile Knights is nothing but crap.'

        Ridiculed, yet, Lancelot was not angry. Instead, he flashed a smile and stabbed Mordred noiselessly. Mordred took a step but he accidentally slipped then a stab of pain shot through his shoulder that weakened him and caused him to kneel on the floor.

        Lancelot walked towards Mordred and stopped in front of him, looking down on his opponent. With all the wounds and scratches all over his body, still, his spirit was unyielding.

        'As I thought, jeune monsieur.'

        'Did you take the attacks and leave the trails of blood on purpose?!' Mordred champed with rage.

        'Yeah. You’re strong but you can’t withstand the test of storms. You are strong only when you’re in a predictable place and favorable conditions. It only takes one accident to break you down because you’re just a little bird kept in a golden cage——'

        'NO! I’m born to be a King!' Mordred said hideously, 'You despicable bastard. Don’t you look down on me… No one can look down on me!'

        Mordred took out a purple round stone and shoved it into his wound. Then a sheet of black flame burst out! As the purple light rotated around his body, his wound was healed immediately and his bones and muscles grew and changed. With his eyes full of greed, he murmured, 'I… am a king…I’m born a king...'

        'You… are really crazy!'

        Looking up at the taller and black-magic-distorted monster that could barely call a human, Lancelot turned around and ran to the exit hastily.

        Instead of chasing after Lancelot, the monstrous Mordred blocked Lancelot’s way easily with just one leap and grabbed him with one hand. Mordred’s immense strength almost suffocated Lancelet.

        “Arthur… I’m sorry but it seems like I can’t see you again...”
Lancelot thought regrettably as his consciousness slowly became fuzzy...
