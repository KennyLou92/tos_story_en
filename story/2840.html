        <h1>Debacle Expulsion - Yibb</h1>
        <p>Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.3

        As a follower of the lord of creation, Yibb became disillusioned with Daoloth’s imperfections and left in pursuit of the perfect life. It was only after beholding the awe-inspiring power of Azathoth, the lord of destruction, that it realized the diversity of strength and converted itself to destruction.

        Yibb’s frenzied exploration persisted until Azathoth disappeared one day. Together with the other followers of destruction, Yibb ventured to the land where Azathoth was last seen—Tarones. It was only through the sacrifice of Fthaggua that they learned Azathoth’s whereabouts.
　　
        Yibb advanced to rescue Azathoth, only to discover that Daoloth’s body harbored a putrid force that originated in the higher dimensions during the process.

        Azathoth desired to sever the alien force from Daoloth’s body, in hopes of saving it from its ill-fated end. Yibb, too, recognized the baneful nature of the high-dimensional force and thus collaborated with Azathoth. Together they convinced Ubbo, a follower of creation, to join forces with them.

        With all preparations in place, the determined party decided to set their plan in motion.

        Ubbo took the initiative and managed to separate the alien force from within Daoloth, making the ultimate sacrifice. Meanwhile, Azathoth marshaled the power of constellations to obliterate the malevolent force, but an unexpected interloper arrived and stopped it.

        It was Y’golonac, one of the followers of destruction, who ensnared Azathoth with the thread of causality, intending to drain away its powers, existence, and fate. With its powers slowly consumed by the thread of causality, Azathoth was unable to exterminate the alien force.

        Upon witnessing the scene, Yibb immediately commanded Y’golonac, shouting, “Y’go! Untie the thread at once!”

        “Huh? After all the effort I put into this, why would I possibly untie it?”  The headless mass of flesh the size of a fingernail gave out a sardonic chuckle, sitting on the other end of the thread of causality.

        “What do you want?”

        “Destruction, of course! I want to dismantle the very fabric of creation and destruction, breaking the rules that govern this world!”

        Rarely succumbing to anger, Yibb was about to charge forward and slay Y’golonac but a shadow lunged from behind, toppling Yibb with such a brute force that caused Yibb to lose its grip on the instinct of creation.

        The contorted iridescence slipped from Yibb’s grasp. Yibb vigorously shook off the figure on its back, attempting to retrieve the alien force, but the latter intercepted it again, revealing its true form—a reptilian creature with numerous arms and orifices.

        “What are you? Beat it!” Yibb questioned in fury.

        “I am Mordiggian, the one who shall replace Azathoth!” said Mordiggian, an inferior by-product of Daoloth’s creation of Tarones. An accidental glimpse of Daoloth’s true form sparked an intense sense of self within it and an ambition to rise to Daoloth’s status. For that purpose, it did not hesitate to consume the remnants of Arwassa, a follower of creation, to be rid of its inferior soul.

        Later, Mordiggian hunted and murdered Y’golonac when it arrived on the Tarones. After assimilating Y’golonac, Mordiggian learned of its deepest desires and decided to conspire with each other, plotting to disrupt the universe’s fate.

        “Preposterous!”

        “I think we should let the results speak for themselves!” Not wasting another second more, Mordiggian mustered the intricate powers in its body. Its physical form transformed, sprouting two spiked appendages that were poised to strike at Yibb with fierce velocity.

        With a nimble turn, Yibb evaded Mordiggian’s attack and darted past it, determined to retrieve the instinct of creation. However, Mordiggian swiftly leaped over Yibb’s head and blocked its way effortlessly, swaying the two burly beast-like legs that emerged from the bottom part of its body.

        None of the appendages and beastly legs were congruous with Mordiggian’s torso, for they were not its own. They belonged to Atlach and Ghatanothoa, the siblings born of the same celestial essence.

        “So you captured Atlach and Ghatanothoa, and made them your raw material for making the thread of causality.” Yibb discerned the truth with astuteness and calm clarity.

        “Indeed, I’ve devoured their powers, and now I shall use them to defeat you!” Mordiggian grinned, arrogance evident in its voice.

        “Humph! An imposter shall forever remain an imposter! You can never be the original one! Everything you do is nothing but a pitiful imitation!” Yibb retorted.

        “Silence! I will show you who the true imposter is!” Yibb’s words exasperated Mordiggian, whose eyes now burned with crimson resentment. Ignoring the potential consequences to its soul, Mordiggian unleashed all its powers, controting its grotesque form with more appendages and beastly limbs.

        With a mighty kick, Mordiggian generated an immense force that propelled itself toward Yibb at high speed. Unwilling to take the attack head-on, Yibb tried to evade but a voice suddenly sounded from its back.

        “Yibb! You can’t escape!” Y’golonac stealthily appeared behind Yibb, embracing its body tightly  with two arms. Yibb struggled to break free but found itself trapped as Mordiggian closed in. Narrowing its eyes, Yibb harnessed the powers within its body—

        Pfft! Pfft! Two strong and powerful arms sprouted from Yibb’s waist, swiftly grabbing hold of the charging Mordiggian. Leaving the assailant no time to react, Yibb pulled it close to its faces that combined into one monstrous visage and squirted Mordiggian with a viscous and corrosive fluid!

        “ARGH—!” Mordiggian wailed in pain as the fluid dissolved its body into a shapeless mass, forcing it to wraith helplessly in the vast space.

        Without letting its guard down, Yibb attempted to seize Y’golonac at once. Yet, the sly creature  quickly released Yibb and slipped away from its back as soon as its partner’s attack proved unsuccessful.

        Yibb contemplated pursuing Y’golonac but a resounding roar from Azathoth halted its steps. It raised its head to gaze upon Azathoth, whose form continued to grow and disintegrate simultaneously. With curses filled its body for eternity, the continuous distortion persisted to consume Azathoth’s soul, plunging it into the grave of madness.

        However, the crisis was far from over. The thread of causality had transformed into a wellspring of powers due to the backlash of karma after Azathoth had forcibly torn it apart. It attached  deeply to Azathoth’s skin and continued to absorb its soul.

        “Azathoth… It has broken free from the thread of causality and swallowed the instinct of creation, but that also leads to its second infection, coupled with the backfiring thread of causality… Azathoth will eventually disappear. Following the demise of the perfect species, the world will wither because of deficient powers… No! I will not accept this ending!”

        Yibb summoned every ounce of its powers and ventured into the range of Azathoth, disregarding the danger. The high-dimensional forces that leaked from Azathoth’s body immediately assaulted Yibb, releasing countless invisible blades that left numerous gashes on its skin. Thick fluid slowly oozed from the wounds but Yibb did not care—more precisely, it could not spare a glance at its own wounds for the high-dimensional forces had demanded all its will just to retain its sense of self.

        Fortunately, Azathoth’s rampage had just begun, meaning that the storm of distorted powers had not reached its peak, which allowed Yibb to drag its scarred body to the front of Azathoth. By the time Yibb made it to Azathoth, it had lost four of its hands. With the only one face left, its opened its mouth and sank its sharp teeth into the core of powers on Azathoth’s body—

        Boom! A wake akin to a supernova explosion spread out from Azathoth.

        Yibb managed to tear the thread of causality away from Azathoth, punctuating the disintegration of its soul. However, Yibb’s intrusion also triggered the clash between the two opposing high-dimensional forces within Azathoth, which shattered both its physical and spiritual forms as they instinctively rejected its existence.

        Yet, creation emerged amid the destruction of Yibb—the fragments of Yibb’s body unified with the powers that overflowed from Azathoth’s body and gave birth to a new species. In an embryonic form, they spread throughout the boundless space and eventually form a new kind, which was later known as the ancient demons.

        Right before the demise of Yibb’s soul, it bore witness to the birth of this new life whose exquisite beauty captivated it. With its remaining will, Yibb bestowed a final blessing upon the new species and said, “Born in between destruction and creation, you carry the mission of evolution. You shall resist the fate of elimination and seek your true belonging in this realm while I shall observe you from the depths of the void… ”</p>
