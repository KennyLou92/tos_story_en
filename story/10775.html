        <h1>Psychological Observer - Clark</h1>
        <p>
                It was a snowy day in Verdilles, a kingdom located in the western Tarones.

        Amidst the heavy snowfall that blanketed everything with a layer of white, a young girl struggled to make her way through the snow on the border. Even her long eyelashes were covered with snowflakes.

        ‘It’s too dangerous to walk in a blizzard like this. Since there’s still some time left, I should take shelter until the snow stops,’ the girl, Clark, thought to herself while scanning her surroundings. She then decisively headed toward the mountainside where she spotted some flickering lights.

        A moment later, Clark arrived at an elegant manor that stood resolutely amidst the biting wind and snow. She hastened her steps to the door. Yet, she did not knock on the door right away; instead, she dust off the snow on her body at the entrance before raising her hand to gently knock on the door. However, no one answered the door.

        ‘Is there no one inside? But the lights are on,’ Clark thought. She then knocked once more and patiently waited, but still, no one responded.

        Just as Clark was about to give up, she heard a few muffled sounds from inside, and soon the door was opened—

        Standing behind the door was a beautiful woman. She seemed a bit flustered as her breath came in short gasps. Yet, her nervous expression softened when she saw Clark.

        The woman asked with a warm smile, “May I help you with something?”

        “I’m sorry, but the blizzard is kind of strong. Would you mind if I take shelter in your house for a while?” Clark asked with such a youthful and amiable smile that made it impossible for one to refuse.

        “Oh, indeed the blizzard is quite fierce today,” the woman nodded understandingly. Stepping aside, she warmly invited Clark in, “Please come in, I can’t let a young girl walk in a dangerous blizzard like this.”

        “Thank you,” Clark bowed gratefully to the woman and then entered the house. She walked into the living room that had a cozy and simple decor.

        “Do you live here alone?” Clark casually asked after she quietly surveyed the room.

        “Yes, I prefer to live in solitude,” the woman replied.

        “That’s strange. If you live alone, why do you have so many pairs of slippers of various sizes?” Clark smiled as she glanced toward the shoe cabinet near the entrance, which indeed held shoes of different sizes.

        The woman’s face changed for a second. However, she quickly regained composure. She said with a hint of melancholy, “If I’m being honest, I just went through a divorce recently. The shoes belong to my ex-husband and children. I haven’t had the chance to tidy them up yet.”

        “Mm Hmm,” Clark made a mystifying nasal sound, causing the woman to tense herself. However, she quickly chuckled and said, “I see, I’m so sorry for bringing up your past troubles.”

        “It’s okay. It’s all in the past now.” The woman breathed an inaudible sigh of relief. Resuming her relaxed demeanor, she asked, “You must be tired and hungry after all the walking in the snow. Let me get you some food and hot beverages to warm your body up a little.”

        “Wouldn’t that be too much trouble for you?”

        “Not at all, I was just thinking of having a cup of tea,” the woman said.

        “I’ll have some then, thank you.”

        As the woman turned around, a flicker of malice appeared in her eyes. Clark, on the other hand, remained oblivious, sitting comfortably on the sofa in the living room with her back against the woman. Suddenly, she noticed something at her feet.

        Clark bent down to pick it up only to find that it was a small flower hair clip, the kind a little girl aged five or six would adore.

        ‘Hmm… I see,’ Clark pondered. Then, she abruptly stood up and shouted to the woman in the kitchen, “Madam, your house is truly beautiful. I’ve always wanted one like yours. Would you mind if I take a look around?

        In response to Clark‘s request, there was a clattering sound of falling dishes.

        “Madam, what happened? Is everything alright?”

        “Oh, nothing, just a slip of my hand,” the woman’s voice sounded slightly distraught. With bated breath, she said, “I’m really sorry but I’ve been very busy lately and I haven’t had time to clean the house. This place is too messy for me to give you a proper tour. ”

        “Oh, really? Or is it because you’re hiding something?”

        “Ah!” The woman suddenly exclaimed.

        “Are you alright?” Clark looked toward the kitchen and noticed that the woman seemed to have accidentally cut her finger. She immediately rushed into the kitchen to check on her, but the woman forcefully pushed her back and sternly exclaimed, “DON’T come in!”

        The woman, realizing her discourteous outburst, quickly adopted a remorseful look as she apologized, “I-I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scold you. I just got startled a little bit.”

        Clark gazed silently at the woman for a while, her expression indecipherable.

        “Is there something wrong?”

        Clark shook her head and replied calmly, “Nothing. I should be the one apologizing since it was my joke that startled you.”

        After that, Clark returned to the living room and remained seated on the sofa until the woman brought out the food.

        “Let’s enjoy it in the dining room,” the woman invited Clark to the dining room where she placed a cup of steaming coffee and a slice of appetizing cream cake before her.

        “Here, enjoy it while it’s hot. Make yourself at home,” the woman enthusiastically served Clark, as if the awkward conversation they had a moment ago had never happened.

        “Thank you,” Clark politely nodded. She picked up the cup and took a sniff, “It’s such a fragrant coffee, so fragrant that I almost can’t smell the hypnotic drug you put inside it.”

        “...Oh, ar-are you joking again?” The woman forced a smile, but it appeared somewhat strained.

        “No, I’m not,” Clark said while picking up a fork. However, instead of taking a bite of the fluffy cake, she prodded it with the fork as she commented, “Well, it seems you didn’t put drugs in this cake, but you added a lot of sugar. Let me guess. You added it to make sure I would drink the coffee, am I right? Madam, or should I say, Madam Widow, the wanted fugitive?”

        “I-I have no idea what you’re talking about,” the woman denied, her face turning dark.

        “Oh really?” Clark chuckled softly, “Well, then let me explain it to you. You’re not the owner of this house but a wanted fugitive, a widow who has fled from Romansh, the neighboring country, after poisoning your five husbands for their inheritance. By coincidence, you found this manor during your escape, and seized by a wicked thought, you killed the couple who lived here and hid their bodies in the kitchen. That’s why you panicked when I rushed into the kitchen earlier.” 

        “How do you know all of this?”

        “You told me yourself,” Clark pointed at the woman, “Your face, your breath, your words, they told me everything. I also know that you planned to kill their daughter, but she escaped upstairs when I came, which is why you refused to give me the house tour.”

        “Who… WHO are you?”

        “Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself,” Clark gracefully stood up and bowed, “I am Mary Higgins Clark, a detective working for the Mensa Academy. It’s such a pleasure meeting you.”

        “The Mensa Academy you said…” The woman, now exposed, dropped all her pretense and gave a hysterical laugh, “Humph! Just because you’re exceptionally intelligent doesn’t mean you can take me down!”

        The widow swiftly retrieved a dagger secured by her thigh. She folded her body and extended one leg in the air, showcasing extraordinary flexibility as she prepared to hurl the dagger. However, several magical beams composed of starlight enveloped her, thwarting her attack before it could be unleashed.

        “My apologies, I forgot to mention, I’m also an eldus who has a fair understanding of magic,” Clark twirled the wand in her hand and said with an apologetic smile.

        “Dammit… I was so close!”  the restrained widow cursed in frustration, knowing that she had no hope of escape.

        Turning a deaf ear to the widow’s resentful words, Clark went straight to the attic and found the girl, the only survivor of the family, hiding in a secret wardrobe.

        Clark felt great compassion upon seeing the trembling girl. With a gentle smile, she drew the girl into her arms and comforted her, “There, there. It’s all over. I’ve defeated that bad woman. You’re safe now.”

        Surrounded by Clark’s warmth, the girl who had lost her parents could no longer hold back her tears. Instead of offering more words of comfort, Clark simply held the girl tightly, hoping to alleviate as much of her sorrow as possible.

        Later, after the blizzard stopped,  Clark informed the Verdilles police to take the fugitive back to the station for her deserved trial and notify the girl’s relatives to take care of her.

        It was already noon the next day when everything was taken care of.  Clark looked up at the sun hanging high and murmured to herself, “I have to hurry, or I’ll be late for the ceremony and miss my chance to find the holy grail.”</p>
