        <h1>Alex Louis Armstrong</h1>
        <p>A soldier and a State Alchemist with the alias “Strongarm.” 

His rank is major, and he works for Central Command. 

Despite his intimidating and burly physique, he is needlessly compassionate and easily moved to tears. And for some reason, he is quick to strip down. 

During battle, he uses the backhand armor drawn with transmutation circles to punch anything and everything to transmute things, along with his martial arts skills that makes use of his bulky frame to nimbly attack the opponent. 

He was born into the Armstrong family, a noble clan with a tradition of sending out dignitaries from each generation.
