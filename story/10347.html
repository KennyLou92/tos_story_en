        <h1>Super Sailor Chibi Moon & Helios</h1>
        <p>Super Sailor Chibi Moon is a future Sailor Guardian and the protector of the Moon. 
As the future daughter of Usagi and Mamoru, she is also the first Princess of the 30th Century utopia “Crystal Tokyo”.
Having a rather precocious side, Chibi-Usa often argues with Usagi, who she actually admires and looks up to.

Helios was once the priest of Elysion, which is hidden deep beneath Earth, but he was later captured by Queen Nehelenia. 
On the day of solar eclipse, he appeared before Usagi and Chibi-Usa as a Pegasus and asked for their help.</p>
