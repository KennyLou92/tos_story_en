        <h1>Blustering Chain - Shangguan Wan’er</h1>
        <p>        On the capital planet of the demon territory, Canaan—

        Far away from the bustling downtown district, there was an impoverished slum, enveloped in an eerie gloom that drove most of the people away. In such a desolate place, however, there was an unusually crowded corner hidden in a certain street where people entered a particular door, and once inside, they disappeared.

        Three tough-looking thugs stood guard in front of the door, engaging in idle chatter when no one was passing by.

        “We’ve got so many guests today, twice as many as usual,” sighed the young thug with pink hair.

        “No surprise. The grand prize for this tournament is a weapon from Square Obelisk, the Arms Association. Who wouldn’t want it?” the green-haired man replied.

        “Yeah. Besides, the winner gets that too,” he orange-haired man leered, raising his hand to make a playful gesture. The green-haired man and the pink-haired youth exchanged knowing smiles upon seeing that. Just as they were about to say something, a sweet and charming voice interrupted their conversation.

        “Hey!”

        “Who is it?!” The thugs were startled with a chill of apprehension. Despite their casual conversation, the three of them had not let their guard down. Yet, the comer managed to approach them without arousing their notice, which caused them to be on high alert.

        The thugs turned their heads, but the owner of the voice was nowhere to be seen. While they were puzzled, the voice sounded again, “Look down!”

        The three men reflexively looked down, only to see a little girl standing in front of them. The girl was only as tall as their waists. Still, they can tell she had very stunning features despite her young age.

        Regardless of the dangerous ambiance of the street, the girl showed no signs of fear. With her hands casually tucked into her jacket pockets, she leisurely chewed on a piece of gum, blowing a round bubble.

        As soon as the thugs saw the face of the comer, they lowered their guard and, with a lewd grin, teased the girl, “Kiddo,, this isn’t a place for you. Now go back home and find your mommy for a glass of milk.”

        Pop!

        The thugs was momentarily distracted by the sound of the gum bubble bursting. Before they could regain their composure, another loud boom followed, accompanied by a barrage of flying debris.

        Then they found a pit half the height of a person appeared on the ground who was still smooth a moment ago. The culprit casually swung her right arm, shaking off the dirt and gravel that had stuck to her clothes. Emotionlessly, she asked the thugs, “Can I go in now?”

        “Y-yes!” The astute thugs immediately escorted the girl inside, their earlier frivolous grin replaced by a look of fear.

        “Humph! Those men needed a lesson!” muttered Shangguan Wan’er, crossing her arms, displeased. She then walked toward the basement. As soon as she pushed open the door, the noisy chatter behind fell silent the moment she stepped in.

        None of the guests inside were decent people; their appearances contrasting sharply with Wan’er’s innocent look, making her stand out like a little lamb in a pack of wolves. Nonetheless, Wan’er did not care the silence she had caused. Instead, she walked straight to the stage at the front, gazing at the chainsaw—the size of a human—displayed on the podium.

        “Oh, it’s truly a Square Obelisk creation. It’s a perfect chainsaw!” Completely mesmerized by the chainsaw before her, Wan’er admired the state-of-the-art weapon with undivided attention.

        Under the spotlight, the sleek metal casing of the chainsaw shone with a dazzling gleam. Every component, every structure, was exquisitely crafted.

        Overwhelmed by a surge of excitement, Wan’er could not help but imagine herself rubbing her entire body against the flawless chainsaw. However, she managed to suppress the urge, swallowing hard and forcing back the drooling saliva.

        Finally, the host who had been standing on the side approached Wan’er and whispered, “I’m sorry, may I ask if you are here to participate—”

        “Hey! Is it real that I can get this chainsaw by defeating all the small fries here?” Wan’er rudely interrupted the host. Since she did not bother to lower her voice, her question echoed loudly in the silent underground arena, drawing the angry glares of the “small fries” present.

        “Well… That’s correct.”

        “Then enough with the chitchat. Let’s get this over with!” As Wan’er summoned her power, her slender limbs instantly bulged. Two horns grew from her head and pushed back her hood. With her fair skin turning dark, she shed her previous facade of fragility and innocence.

        “Fiend! She is a fiend!” Someone in the crowd who recognized Wan’er race exclaimed in shock.

        The shout sparked a flurry of discussions. Even those who had previously underestimated Wan’er changed their attitudes, raising their weapons in vigilance.

        However, their vigilance and struggle proved futile against Wan’er’s overwhelming power.

        As Wan’er drew the whip that had been coiled around her waist, she infused all her power into it. With a single flick of the whip, the little girl struck down every opponent around her with a vigorous force, causing them to all collapse to the ground. Yet, she did not stop. She continued to lash her opponents with the whip. Every crack of the whip displayed an unrivaled strength. In mere moments, everyone on the stage, except for the host and Wan’er herself, lay defeated.

        “Phew, finally all down. So now the chainsaw is mine, right?”

        “Y-Yes.”

        “Then I’ll take it now.”


        Wan’er’s heart brimmed with joy at getting the weapon of her dream as she skipped lightly to the chainsaw, allowing her youthful demeanor to shine through. However, her elation turned out to be momentary as a metallic cage descended from above and trapped her inside when she was about to reach the podium.

        “My apologies. Your performance was truly remarkable. Our boss took notice of your resilient body and found you quite amusing, so we had to ask you to stay,”  the host said with a gentle smile.

        “Are you kidding me? What you’re doing is nothing but a scam!” Although Wan’er attempted to pry the metallic bars open, none of them budged.

        “We demons have always valued strength above all else. You can only blame yourself for falling for our trap. And don’t waste your stamina on escaping. This cage was specially designed by our boss. No one can break it, not even a fiend like you. So I recommend you to stay quiet so as to save yourself from unnecessary suffering.”

        “Is that so?” Wan’er sneered. Once again, she channeled her demonic power, gripping the prison tightly with both hands. Her entire body was tense with strained muscles. Through gritted teeth, she said, “Sorry, but I hate following orders! HA—!”

        “You can’t break it—what?! N-no, it can’t be!”

        Wan’er had no intention of destroying the cage. Instead, she exerted all her strength to lift it and hurled it toward the opposite wall, causing a thunderous crash as half of the underground arena was destroyed.

        However, that was not enough to quell Wan’er’s anger. She took the chainsaw, pulled the cord, and started the engine. The roaring sound of the chainsaw further stimulated her hidden frenzy. With a wide grin on her face, she swung the chainsaw in all directions, wreaking havoc in the arena.

        “Wait! Not that pillar! The whole place will collapse if you destroy it!” The host, who had been cowering in a corner, finally mustered the courage to rush toward Wan’er, shouting in an attempt to dissuade her. Unfortunately, his pleas fell on deaf ears and only fueled Wan’er’s violent nature.

        “I’m in the middle of having fun! Get out of my way!” Wan’er shouted while kicking the host aside. Just as she raised the chainsaw and prepared to strike the central pillar, a cold and commanding voice interrupted her.

        “Wan’er.”

Wan’er’s movements froze immediately, as if struck by a petrification spell. The raging aura within her extinguished in an instant. Stiffly, she turned her body and locked eyes with a long-haired girl sitting in a wheelchair.

        The girl possessed breathtaking beauty, but what truly captivated and memorable was her resolute demeanor. There was a profound strength emanating from her clear eyes, revealing the steadfast essence of her soul hidden beneath her beautiful form. That was the most enduring charm.

        “Lady Hitomi! Wh-what brings you here?” Wan’er stammered in surprise.

        “Because someone forgot their mission,” said the girl, Hitomi Tsukishita, who was also known as the representative of humans and the princess of Tōwa Teito, in a gentle tone infused with undeniable authority.

        “I… I didn’t forget! I’m here exactly for our citizens who have been abducted by the demons!”

        “I thought you were trying to bury them instead, considering your attempt to destroy the main pillar just now,” Hitomi Tsukishita said with a gentle smile, but her words carried a mocking undertone.

        “I…” Wan’er’s shoulders slumped in dejection like a deflated balloon. Remorsefully, she apologized, “I’m sorry. I got carried away.”

        “I’m glad you understand your mistake. Otherwise, I’ll have to find a replacement to do my bidding,” Hitomi Tsukishita’s eyes flashed with a sharp glint, revealing an icy gaze that contradicted her appearance. “But never repeat the same mistake. You should know that I owe someone a favor for locating your whereabouts.”

        “I-I won’t! Please don’t send me away, Lady Hitomi!”

        “Then work harder, make amends for your mistake, and show me your worth,” Hitomi Tsukishita  paused. After surveying the chaotic underground arena, she sighed, “But before that, let’s clean up this mess.”</p>
