        <h1>Reneging Supremacy - Zeus</h1>
        <p>
        A Holy God, who once started wars on the Tarones and caused uncounted miseries and disasters. Regarding himself as the King of Gods, he believes that all creatures besides the Holy Gods are just ants.

He was resentful since Enoch had liberated the power of the origin; he even formed a rebellion with other defiant Gods. Yet, he was captured in Year 119. </p>
