        <h1>Blessing of Yata Mirror - Chizuru Kagura</h1>
        <p>Chizuru Kagura is a member of the Kagura that holds one of the three ancient artifacts that initially sealed the serpent monster Orochi. Her family crest is the Yata Mirror. Chizuru is the only inheritor of Kagura-ryuu, an ancient martial art. Her real name is Chizuru Yata. Kagura is  a family name to hide her true identity. The Kagura has always been led by twin sisters. Chizuru is mature and calm but sometimes naive. She is more focused on sealing Orochi than Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami. Most of the time, she is the key to the success of Kyo and Ioriâ€™s cooperation.</p>
