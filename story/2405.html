        <h1>Petty Theft - Rupert</h1>
        <p>        A series of yells sounded in a bustling market.

        “Wallet! I lost my wallet!”

        “Some of my fruits are missing!”

        “Where the heck is my butcher knife?”

        A janitor yelled too, “who took my broomstick?”

        There was only one person who would do such a thing——Rupert the most notorious thief of the town.

        Rupert had an uncatchable stealing speed. Nothing was safe as long as he had his eyes on the prize, no matter the governor’s precious gem and the broomstick of the janior. So far, he hadn’t been caught for once yet.

        All his victims gathered around to grumble together.

        “That’s enough! He literally steals everything!”

        “That boy is a bugger!”

        “He only steals things from mortals. I bet he doesn’t have the gut to steal from Alice in her Wonderland!”

        Alice the owner of the Wonderland had the ability to manipulate elements. With her powerful magic and dark personality, no one would dare to mess with her.

        Everyone in the conversation agreed.

        “Exactly. All Rupert does is picking on commoners like us. He would never challenge Alice!”

        None of them knew that Rupert was eavesdropping at the street corner. The conversation was an utter cut to his ego.

        “Damn it. How dare you underestimate me! I’ll prove myself by doing the exact same thing you said I didn’t have the gut to do!”

        Rupert found the entrance of the Wonderland by tailing Mad Hatter, Alice’s right-hand. Soon, he arrived at the perimeter of Alice’s manor.

        Numerous pawns were patrolling, making the place impenetrable. 

        This wasn’t a problem to Rupert at all. He stole the sword of the pawn closest to him, and threw it at another pawn. A fight then began between the two pawns.

        Rupert repeated the trick a few times to create a chance to sneak into the manor.

        Stepping into the building, Rupert entered a sealed chamber with six walls and a table at the center.

        There was a tiny door on one of the walls, which only fitted Rupert’s arm. Meanwhile, three identical bottles labelled “Drink me” were placed on the table.

        Rupert knew that there was only one real shrinking potion, and he would be dead immediately if he drank the wrong one.

        He laughed.

        “This trap is stupid. Only rookie thieves would fall for it. Why would the house owner use such a troublesome way to get in and out? There must be another door.

        A pocket watch was hung on another wall. Taking it down, Rupert winded the hands to twelve o’clock. Click! Another door opened.

        “This is too easy! Alice’s manor is just another piece of cake!”

        Right after Rupert celebrated his success, he found his feet trapped on the check-patterned floor by plant roots.

        The interior of the room shifted immediately, turning into a bedroom. There was no other furniture except the king bed at the center.

        “Who is a piece of cake to you?”

        A cold voice spoke behind Rupert, who was apparently Alice. The petite girl had a pale poker face, exuding with a creepy vibe.

        “I’ve been expecting you,” Alice sneered. “Everything in the house is enchanted. Strangers will get trapped once they touch my stuff. Who told you to touch my pocket watch?”

        “Alright! I lost! Just kill me! Even if you don’t, I’d rather be dead because I don’t wanna hear people saying “Rupert didn’t steal anything in the Wonderland”!” Rupert yelled with utter embarrassment.

        Alice squinted for Rupert’s determination in theft. At this moment, she decided to teach him a lesson of frustration. 

        “Actually you did steal something. You stole Mad Hatter’s heart.”

        In the meantime, someone in a hat was looking at Rupert shyly at a corner.

        “What?” Rupert was stunned.

        “He fell in love with you, Rupert. From now on, Mad Hatter will live with you and stick around you. Promise me to take good care of him,” said Alice.

        Rupert finally surrendered himself and knelt before Alice for mercy.

        “Sorry! I’m sorry! I...I shouldn’t have disturbed your peace, and your right-hand! Please let me go! I...I’ll never steal again!”

        “What? Surrender already? You’re pathetic. The spot for my right-hand is not for you! Forget it. Get out of my sight!” Alice was disappointed. The moment Alice unlifted the chant, Rupert fled the Wonderland as fast as he could.

        “He deserved it. Hope he’ll behave himself,” Alice thought.

        At this moment, Alice spotted something on her bed had gone missing. 

        “Damn!”

***

        “HAHAHA!”

        Rupert was bouncing joyfully on his way home. He was holding a retractable claw with his trophy hanging on it——Alice’s panties.

        “I didn’t touch it, Lady Alice.” Rupert continued in laughter, “I’m the greatest thief of all time!”
