        <h1>Impermanent Aggregates - Dipankara</h1>
        <p>
                In the middle of the night, a man ran through the dense forest, his footsteps frantic with fear. Unsurprisingly, he soon tripped over a rock and fell to the ground. In that fleeting moment, a massive black shadow leaped from behind and pinned the man down as he struggled to get back up.

        It was an agile wolf, appearing exceptionally robust under the moonlight. While its fur was stained with fresh blood accentuating its ferocity, its deep golden eyes fixated on the man beneath it, whose eyes widened in terror.

        “Please! Do-Don’t kill me!” the man pleaded in anguish, but the wolf remained unforgiving. It opened its jaws, ready to sink its teeth into the man’s neck, only to feel a sudden blast of scorching heat coming from afar. Instinctively, it leaped back, narrowly evading a torrent of pneuma-powered flames.

        “Who dares stop me?” the wolf growled with a deep, wrathful voice.

        “I am Dipankara, a disciple of the Abbey of Perfect Enlightenment,” a clear and youthful voice echoed through the silent forest as a young man walked toward the wolf. Undeterred by the wolf’s intimidation, the young man, Dipankara, gazed at the beast with his crystal-clear eyes and  a hint of youthful determination in his brows.

        “Ve-venerable Master!” The moment the man heard Dipankara’s name, he crawled toward the young man as if he had found a savior. Clutching onto Dipankara’s robes, he tearfully implored, “This demon wolf is a heinous murderer! It slaughtered everyone in our village. Please, Master, rid us of this monster!”

        “Hah! Yes, I did massacre the entire village but they had it coming! Boy, walk away now, or else I’ll kill you too!”

        ‘I knew demons are all born evil, with a natural inclination toward slaughter and violence. They shall not be spared!’ Dipankara thought. He had detected the scent of blood on the wolf’s fur right from the start, knowing that it had taken numerous lives. He hoped his words could turn the wolf away from its wicked path, yet its unrepentant nature extinguished his meager trace of compassion.

        “Since you persist in your sanguinary ways, you leave me no choice but to eradicate you for the world’s sake!” Dipankara formed intricate hand seals and chanted incantations, concentrating the essence of his pneuma-powered flames at his fingertips.

        “Humph! Bring it on!” The wolf let out an enraged howl and lunged toward Dipankara only to be blocked by an eruption of pneuma-powered flames. Yet, it remained undeterred as it rolled on the ground to put out the flames that licked its furs, and launched another attack.

        The battle continued, each exchanging blows, and neither gaining the upper hand. The standoff persisted until the moment the man attempted to flee.

        “Not a chance!” The demon wolf’s eyes, now bloodshot from the fierce battle, bulged with fury. Despite Dipankara’s blast of flames, it raced toward the man, enduring the scorching burns while baring its fangs to sink into the depth of the man’s flesh.

        ‘At last… I have avenged you all, my children…’ Tears of grief streamed down the wolf’s crimson eyes. Upon the completion of the wolf’s revenge, losing the reason to fight with Dipankara, it fled toward the peak of the mountain with its heavily wounded body, its bloodstained countenance revealed a hint of desperate longing.

        However, Dipankara was unaware of the wolf’s intent. Infuriated by his inability to prevent the wolf’s bloodshed, he muttered in a low voice, “Demon! I shall ensure your demise!”

        Soon after Dipankara formed hand seals to muster his powers, the wind gathered around his feet, propelling him through the clouds, chasing after the wolf until they reached a cave in the mountain.

        Inside the cave, the injured demon wolf could no longer support its own body. It crawled on the ground, painstakingly gathering several desiccated bodies of young wolves into its embrace. Each of the young wolves had a concave chest with visible knife wounds on their bodies, which indicated that someone had cut open their chests and extracted their hearts.

        It was then that Dipankara came to the realization of the reason behind the wolf’s massacre. Standing at the cave entrance, he gazed upon the barely breathing wolf. A profound sorrow welled up within him as he softly inquired, “So, you annihilate the village for revenge…”

        “Ha… Yes, those ignorant humans believed that consuming the heart of a demon wolf would grant them immortality. But those cowards didn’t dare to fight me, so they waited for me to leave the cave in search of food. Then they sneaked in and cut open the hearts of my children…” The wolf suddenly grinned, revealing its sharp, bloodstained teeth as it continued, “So I went and cut theirs open, one by one!”.

        “...Two wrongs don’t make one right. Only by letting go can we find solace and end the cycle of hatred.”

        “I don’t need solace, nor redemption. I only need a swift end…” The demon wolf lifted its head, an eerie light flashing across its dying eyes fixated on Dipankara. “So, monk, why don’t you join us?”

        “You—” It was until then that Dipankara realized that while the wolf was speaking to him, it had crushed the demon core within its body. A sudden wave of tremendous power erupted, bearing down on the defenseless Dipankara. Just as he was on the verge of death, someone arrived, scooping him up and swiftly carrying him away from the cave.
 
        Boom!

        A deafening explosion reverberated through the forest as the cave collapsed, crushing the ground around.

        The two miraculously escaped unscathed, finding solid footing in a safe spot. After steadying himself, Dipankara looked at the old man beside him, his voice filled with confusion. “Master, what…brings you here?”

        “I divined that you were in danger, so I hurried here,” said the Enlightened Master, placing his hands on Dipankara’s shoulders. After ensuring that Dipankara was unharmed, he gave him a faint smile and continued, “Fortunately, I came just in time.”

        “...Master, I don’t understand,” Dipankara asked while gazing at the collapsed cave. “Who was wrong between the mother wolf and the villagers? The wolf did kill a hundred people but she did it because the villagers had taken the hearts of her young children…”

        “Dipankara, don’t get too involved,” the Enlightened Master spoke with profound wisdom, “We meet and we part, it is merely a part of life; karma will take its course, and we, as ascetics, shall observe and seek insights. Never get too attached or you’ll lose yourself.”

        “I still don’t understand…”

        “Don’t worry,” the Enlightened Master comforted Dipankara with a gentle pat on his shoulder, “Time will lead you to the path of truth.”

        With a mind full of doubts, Dipankara returned to the Abbey of Perfect Enlightenment alongside his master. It was not until the wars of the gods’ investiture broke out, after witnessing scenes of chaos and conflict, that Dipankara finally grasped the meaning behind his master’s words...</p>
