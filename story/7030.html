        <h1>Rodan</h1>
        <p>
        Rodan is a gigantic pterosaur-type kaiju that hatches underground from prehistoric eggs as a result of global warming. The creature made its debut in RODAN (1956). After the shockwave force of its wing movement strikes the Saikai Bridge and destroys part of the city, Rodan is defeated when the military uses explosives to cause an eruption of the volcano at Mount Aso, Kyushu. Rodanalsostars in GHIDORAH, THE THREE HEADED MONSTER (1964) and returned for two more Showa-era films: INVASION OF ASTRO-MONSTER (1965) and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS (1968). The Rodan of the Heisei era first appears in GODZILLA VS. MECHAGODZILLA II (1993). In a new island setting, the creature emerges and, as its power grows, evolves into Fire Rodan. Like the original Rodan, it is capable of creating a sonic boom shockwave with its wings. It also has a new beam-like weapon known as the Uranium Heatwave.</p>
