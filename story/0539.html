        <h1>Shen Gongbao the Tao Achiever</h1>
        <p>        Lightning flashed across the sunny sky and struck the floating mountain.  There a figure jumped onto a floating rock at his back.  Shen Gongbao put away his thunder whip as he reached his opponent.  He guessed, the pneuma of his opponent should have been exhausted, and he had always been more skillful in flying on the clouds than his opponent did.  This time he would definitely win.  They chased after each other between the floating rocks.  Shen Gongbao yelled at his opponent - “Ziya, there’s no way you can run - ”

        Suddenly a divine crane landed from the clouds and said, “Master Jiang Shang, the Celestial Divinity summons you.” Shen Gongbao heard its words and sighed, for the duel between him and Jiang Shang was interrupted yet again before the winner was determined.  He then stood still to adjust his breath, yet he found his opponent was still going farther.  Shen Gongbao turned his head abruptly to see his fellow standing on the floating mountain, nodding to the divine crane.

        “Ziya!”

        “You have mastered the art of spells so skillfully that I could hardly fend off.  Please kindly forgive me for escaping now as I was summoned by our mentor!”

        Shen Gongbao stared at him in rage and he never knew if his fellow had seen that.  Being left alone in the mountains, he was angered as he saw Jiang Shang left together with the divine crane.

        Though Shen Gongbao bore Jiang Shang no grudge, he could not help regarding Jiang Shang as a useless rascal.  Shen Gongbao was the most junior disciple of the Celestial Divinity, for he was the latest to began pursuing asceticism.  But it was publicly known that Shen Gongbao was highly talented, that the Trinity of the Heavenly Kingdom were the only ones he could not surpassed.  The celestial children recited, “As all the elder xian have heard, the sky with thunderstorm he girds.  Having the clouds beneath his feet, in the wind that sweeps his rope he fleets.  Riding on his tiger he travels through kingdoms, on his journey is the man of freedom.” Shen Gongbao was delighted to be praised, yet among his peers, he could never grasp how much had Jiang Shang got.  He always attempted to try Jiang Shang out under the name of sparring, but his fellow always rejected his invitations.  Even if he agreed to practice, he never gave his best.  Shen Gongbao had been refining his skills for centuries, so it was impossible that he was no match for Jiang Shang.  Through divination he learnt that Jiang Shang would be leaving the mountains soon, so he forced his senior to spar with him using both carrot and stick.  But once again Jiang Shang turned him down, and the winner could not be determined even after Jiang Shang’s departure.  Later, Shen Gongbao was made known to the investiture of Gods and went to the realm of men on his own. 

        ‘I don’t hate him,’ In front of the water gate, Shen Gongbao adjusted his breath.  ‘This is more like a solid friendship, isn’t it?’ His tiger leaned against him as he wished when he was picturing the realm of men.  Together with his tiger, Shen Gongbao jumped through the gate and into the secular world.  At the coming on of a squall of smoke, he saw soldiers tangling with their enemies in the fire.  Their voices aroused Shen Gongbao.  He held his thunder whip up high.  At the moment the soldiers encountered the mischievous ascetic, a thunderbolt struck the armies -</p>
