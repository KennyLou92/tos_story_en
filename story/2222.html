        <h1>Diamond</h1>
        <p>Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 1

        “Hmm, I can’t see the outer world even from here,” a slender teen Diamond mumbled at the watchtower of a castle. Messed up by the strong wind, his silver hair was reflecting countless dazzling sparks.

        He put his hand above his eyes when he gazed at the skyscraping walls afar.

        The walls separated the nation from the outside by forming an enclosed circle, where the inner ring was the Kingdom Raimonia, the homeland of “minerelves”. The kingdom was ruled by the royal family in the castle, and Diamond would be the first heir to the throne.

        “I will explore the outer world no matter what lies ahead!” Diamond clenched his fists and swore. After the pep talk to himself, he returned from the watchtower to his room. Strangely, he took out a female school uniform in his closet.

        It took Diamond a round of effort to put on the uniform and tidy up his shoulder-length silver hair. After the makeover, he already became a stunning “beauty” without makeup.

        He checked his outfit in front of the mirror and nodded in satisfaction. “No one will suspect that I’m actually a boy——Ouch!”

        Someone bumped Diamond at his back and cut off his self-obsession. Turning around, his gaze contacted another pair of glittering eyes——his second sister.

        Meanwhile, another female minerelf walked in slowly——Diamond’s eldest sister, who crossed her arms in disapproval while staring at his legs.

        “You totally failed in this. No girl will stand with her legs spread open.”

        “Huh?” Diamond closed his legs immediately, who didn’t notice another minerelf sneaking from behind——his third sister. She leaned close to Diamond and tickled his ear.

        “AHHH——!” The startled Diamond pushed his third sister in pale. The next second, he covered his mouth as if he would throw up anytime.

        “Aw, you’re still in disgust whenever you have skinship with girls. How does that make you survive in girls’ school? Why don’t you just give up——”

        “Giving up is not an option!” Cutting in, Diamond waved his hand as a gesture to show his determination. “I’ll be free from the throne and that fiancee once I graduate, and I get to explore the outer world!”

        “What makes you insist on your adventure with all dangers lying outside…” Diamond’s second sister grumbled.

        At this moment, the chimes of the clock reminded Diamond of his business. “I don’t have the time for a debate. I must explore no matter what, and this is something that you old ladies won’t understand!”

        With the fear of his sisters’ retaliation, Diamond ran away immediately, but he didn’t forget to grab a toast for breakfast.

        “I hate this dress. It makes me feel weird when I walk. I’m gonna be late at this pace...Let me take the shortcut.”

        Diamond leaped over the fence while grabbing his dress, which was supposed to lead him right onto the ground. Yet an accident happened this time——a minerelf passed by at the moment Diamond landed. Bang! The two elves collided with each other.

        “Ouch…” Diamond stood up, stroking his painful waist. Then he took a look at the elf he had knocked down——a teen minerelf in school uniform.

        “I’m sorry! Are you alright,” Diamond asked with regret.

        “I-I’m fine.”

        “Good...There’s my ride! Bye!” Diamond left in a rush as he noticed the school carriage was departing.

        Yet Diamond would never expect a disaster induced by this accident in the future. All he cared about now was catching the school carriage, which he made it at last. Relieved, he arrived at the school’s faculty room on time.

        Diamond looked around cautiously, but he was confused when no one showed up as he had expected.

        “This is weird. Why hasn’t she shown up...I thought she had sworn to stop me...Anyway, no time to care about her. She won’t come here anyway.”

        Diamond knocked on the faculty room’s door after tidying himself up a bit...</p>
