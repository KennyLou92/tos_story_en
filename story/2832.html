        Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.4

        On the day of the Century Feast, May Lily learned dreadful news from the soldiers—Cornflower was dead. However, he refused to believe it without seeing the prince’s body himself so he left the soldiers and ran straight to Blossomville, where the Mother Tree was.

        In the middle of his way, he spotted that the towering Mother Tree was engulfed in purple flames which only continued to grow without any signs of going out. The unusual phenomenon sent a sense of dread in his chest so he broke into a sprint, fearing the worst.

        May Lily knew that there had been a bloody battle the moment he stepped into Blossomville; the flowerbeds were all trampled and there were petals scattered over the ground soaked in different elves’ sap.

        By then, the war seemed to have come to an end. The rebel army who had been defeated by the imperial troop was detained on the right side of an open space while the wounded soldiers gathered on the left. Meanwhile, the remaining soldiers who were still able to walk were busy carrying buckets of water to douse the flames on the Mother Tree.

        ‘Where’s the prince?’ asked Cornflower, grabbing a soldier’s collar. He could not care less about the Mother Tree for nothing mattered more than Cornflower to him. Panicked, the soldier pointed to a corner where three soldiers were squatting in a circle around someone.

        With a few strides, May Lily walked to the soldiers and shoved them aside only to see Cornflower motionless on the ground. His face looked deathly pale and he seemed to have no sign of life.

        ‘May Lily, Prince Cornflower has…’ One of the soldiers stumbled choking with tears.

        ‘No! There’s no way he’s dead!’ May Lily refused to accept the reality since he had a feeling that he would be denying the possibility of Cornflower being still alive once he nodded and accepted it as the truth, even though the chance was faint. Holding the prince’s body in his arm, he put both his hands on Cornflower’s chest and channeled his power so that the elements could heal his body. Still, there was no response from Cornflower.

        ‘You said you’d be my purpose of living . You asked me to live for you so you can’t die before I do!’ Instead of giving up, May Lily continued to send his power into the prince’s body.

        ‘Lub-dub.’ Suddenly, May Lily felt an extremely faint pulse inside Cornflower so he put his ear to the latter’s chest and listened carefully—the prince’s heart was beating slowly.

        “I can hear his heart beat. Even though it’s slow, his heart is still beating!” May Lily straightened up his body in excitement and shouted at the soldiers, ‘The prince is still alive! Call the doctor, now!’

        The soldiers immediately ran to fetch the doctor. A senior doctor soon came and performed a careful examination of Cornflower. After a moment, he said in a deep tone, ‘There is an extremely rare poison in Prince Cornflower’s body. It is a deadly poison that can paralyze an elf and cause heart failure as it circulates around the body through blood flow. It seems that the Prince had great blood loss that helped reduce the amount of toxin in his body, but I’m afraid he won’t be able to make it.’

        ‘Then what are you waiting for?! Just give him the antidote!’ said May Lily hastily, forgetting all his manners.

        ‘Unfortunately, there’s no antidote to this poison. The only cure is to replace his sap with another floral-elf’s but it is only a temporary solution—the other elf will die of the poison.’

        ‘That’s easy. Take my sap—’ Just when May Lily lifted his arm to give his hand to the doctor, a delicate dagger decorated with gems fell out of his sleeve. The dagger was a gift that Cornflower had given him in the past.

        Back then, May Lily and Cornflower accompanied Sakura to the mountain to collect some herbs but they encountered a ferocious giant spider on the way. In order to help Sakura and Cornflower escape, he used himself as bait to distract the spider only to put himself on the brink of death. Luckily, Cornflower came back just in time with a troop of soldiers to save him.

        It was only until later when Cornflower and Sakura expressed their anxiety and anger that May Lily finally realized how much they cared about him and began to value himself.

        On the next day after the incident, Cornflower paid him a visit. Putting both his hands on May Lily’s shoulders, he said seriously, ‘May Lily, don’t glorify the acts of sacrifice. You’d only be self-absorbed to think I wanted you to do that for me.’

        ‘But… How am I gonna help you then?’ A rare look of vulnerability and confusion appeared on May Lily’s face.

        ‘It’s simple.’ Cornflower took out an expensive dagger and shoved it into May Lily’s arms. He looked incredibly radiant as the sunlight fell on his azur hair.

        ‘If you really care about me and want me to be happy, then never sacrifice yourself for me. Instead, use this dagger to cut through all difficulties and live for me!’

        As Cornflower’s words sounded in May Lily’s head, they brought a resigned smile to his face.

        “You still manage to find a way to remind me not to sacrifice myself for you when you’re literally on your deathbed, don’t you?” May Lily took a deep breath to calm himself down and organize his disquieting thoughts.

        ‘Sir May Lily?’ The doctor asked in bewilderment after seeing May Lily lapse into silence.

        ‘...No. He would never want any elf to sacrifice their life for his.’ Clenching his hands into fists, May Lily said with determined gaze, ‘There should be another way! I will save him no matter how!’ 

        Coincidentally, a miracle that could save Cornflower happened the second after May Lily said those words—Sakura was there in Blossomville. To his astonishment, she came out of the deep coma and ran straight to the burning Mother Tree!

        When May Lily was going to rescue her after hearing the news, a burst of blinding light came from the Mother Tree, then it burst across the sky and scattered like sparkling dust, melting into every elf’s body, inside and outside the enchantment, including the poisoned Cornflower.

        The power of the Mother Tree purified the poison in Cornflower’s body and pulled him away from the brink of death, bringing him back to life.

        ‘Mmm…’ Cornflower utter a low groan.

        ‘Cornflower!’ May Lily shouted Cornflower’s name emotionally with tears brimming over his eyes uncontrollably; he completely lost his usual composure. Seeing May Lily like that, Cornflower could not help but burst into laughter. He raised a hand to wipe away May Lily’s tears and asked softly, ‘I’m still alive. What are you crying about?’

        ‘...Because I’m so mad at you!’ May Lily roughly wiped away his tears. Staring at Cornflower fiercely, he asked through clenched teeth, ‘Do you know you almost died?!’

        ‘I’m going to be the king so I won’t die so easily.’ With a smile, Cornflower looked into May Lily’s eyes and said in a tender tone, ‘...Thank you for living for me.’

        May Lily looked back at Cornflower. Knowing what the prince meant, he returned him a smile and whispered softly, ‘Yeah.’

        “Hope only exists when we live. Self-sacrifice is nothing but a way of giving up,” May Lily whispered to himself silently while gazing at the horizon. “Father, I will not follow your footsteps.”</p>
