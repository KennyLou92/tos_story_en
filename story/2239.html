        Minerelves’ Record Story (Prequel) Ch. 5

        Inside an isolated country, there nurtured a special sort of elves. The species was called minerelf, for their body structure consisted of jewels. The nation gradually thrived under the king’s rule, and this story began at the thriving age…

        The sky was overcast in the afternoon; the air was heavier than usual.  In the Minerelf Girls’ School, the elves in the classroom were unable to focus.  Usually, the teacher Aquamarine would wake the students up from the daze.  But today, rarely did he act like the students, staring through the window blankly.

        “Sigh, I shouldn’t have said those heavy words...She is stubborn after all...Maybe I should comfort her after school.” Aquamarine was occupied with his fiancée Rhodochrosite.

        “Sir, Mr. Aquamarine!” The monitor sitting in the front could not help but shout.  After several times, Aquamarine finally responded.  Knowing that every student was looking at him, he felt embarrassed inside.

        “What am I doing!?  It’s totally a shame with my mind wandering in class.” Aquamarine lectured himself seriously.  Shaking off the unnecessary thought, he was able to finish the class at last.

        Then, he dragged his own heavy body back to the staff office and threw himself on the chair with stricken exhaustion.  When Aquamarine tried to take a cup of water, he accidentally pushed a book off the table; a pile of papers scattered over the floor, revealing beautifully-written paragraphs with crazy contents——

        “Teacher, I like you.  And I know you like me pretty much the same.”
        “Why would you marry that bitch!  You betrayed me!”
        “I knew it!  You must have been deceived by that bitch! Don’t worry.  I’m coming to save you.”

        Disturbed, he picked up the papers and stuffed into the drawer.  However, haunting restlessness still made him unable to sit properly.  As he was about to leave the office, Amethyst, a female elf coming by, almost bumped into him.

        “Woah.  What’s the hurry?” She gloated with a smile.  “You’re going to apologize to Rhodochrosite, aren’t you?”

        “Yes.  Did you see her?”

        “Yup, she is at the school entrance with another student.”

        “Another student?” Aquamarine’s eyelids kept twitching as he saw the drawer was stuffed with threatening letters.  A chill immediately came down his spine.

        “Right.  She said she was going to the buffer zone with Rhodochrosite together——AHH!” Before her conversation finished, Aquamarine could not wait to rush to the entrance.  By the time he had arrived, Rhodochrosite was long gone.

        Then, he headed straight towards the buffer zone——an area within 1km from the city walls.  It was a deserted place with no elves living there.  Sometimes ferocious beasts even wandered around the zone.  Therefore, only a few elves, particularly for those who liked challenges, would sneak in.

        “Oh NOO——Help!”

        After searching for a while, a scream sounded somewhere nearby.  There was a giant centipede catching a female elf, attempting to eat her.  Aquamarine gathered power to glitter in blue; soon a pair of gemblades fell onto his hands.

        He leapt into the air to land on the giant centipede.  With a spin, Aquamarine cut off the podomeres holding the elf with the blades in a flash, and made another jump to the abdomen of the centipede.

        Bang!  The centipede was kicked off to scream and tremble.

        Aquamarine came to the elf and found that she was wearing the school uniform.  Pulling a long face, he pointed the blade close to her neck.

        “You...where is Rhodochrosite!  Say it!”

        “...In-inside...inside that pit…”

        Aquamarine then ran towards the direction she pointed.  In the midway, he saw the appearance of that centipede; heart-wrenching feeling surged within.

        “Rhodochrosite...please be safe…” It was the first time that he prayed sincerely.

        Luckily, the centipede was already dead, just staying down beside the pit.

        “Hey, good to see you here.  I sprained my leg.  Mind to give me a hand?” Rhodochrosite waved at him excitedly at the bottom; apart from a few scratches, she was alright in general.

        At the moment, Aquamarine finally felt relieved.  He slid down the pit, carried her in the back and made it to the top.  As soon as they arrived, that student was already there.

        “Teacher, I love you that much.  Why didn’t you look at me even once?” She yelled.

        “Because I don’t love you,” he responded with a cold face.  “Rhodochrosite is my one and only.  If you dare to hurt her one more time, I’ll make you regret it for the rest of your life!”

        After dropping the words, he and Rhodochrosite then left.

        A moment later, Rhodochrosite spoke gently.  “You’re cool back then.”

        “Of course,” Aquamarine smiled.</p>
