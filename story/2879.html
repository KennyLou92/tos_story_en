        <h1>Arctic Pursuit - Dodo</h1>
        <p>        In the bitter cold tundra, where snow fell endlessly with howling wind, there was only one igloo with a gentle radiance seeping through the walls of ice. Inside the igloo, a girl lay on a bed made of stones, her face plastered with a sickly green pallor.

        By the girl’s side was a young boy who gently wiped her face with a towel dampened with hot water. His movements were delicate and tender as if tending to the most precious treasure.

        The boy was a Druid named Dodo. Long ago, his tribe was annihilated by the demons but a Penguin Druid saved him, making him the only survivor of his kind. Since then, he lived with the Druid and penguins, holding a deep resentment toward the demons who had slaughtered his tribe. Ironically, fate led him to save a girl who turned out to be one of them.

        Dodo called the girl—who had lost her memory—Sasa, and he took her back to his teacher so she could be treated. However, Sasa ran away after Dodo mistakenly believed she hurt one of the penguins and attacked her. Later, Dodo learned of his mistake and decided to bring Sasa back. It was after much hardship that he finally found the unconscious girl and took her back to his teacher.

        Still, the series of incidents and injuries left Sasa’s body in a feeble state, and it filled Dodo with guilt. Therefore, Dodo volunteered to take care of Sasa while his teacher was away searching for herbs.

        Perhaps sensing Dodo’s tender care, Sasa gradually awakened from the coma. As her long, thick lashes fluttered slightly, Dodo exclaimed with excitement, “Sasa!”

        “Hmm… Where am I… Ah!”  Sasa opened her eyes, bewildered as she surveyed her surroundings. When she caught sight of Dodo, her entire body immediately tensed up. She crawled to a corner of the room despite her frail boy, fixing a wary gaze on the boy.

        “You… I…” Sasa’s distrustful gaze brought Dodo a profound sense of shame and distress. Not knowing what to say, he instinctively approached her only to intensify her hostility, prompting her to arch her back and glare at him.

        “St-stay away from me! Go away!” Sasa shouted in fear. She even grabbed something nearby and hurled it toward him, trying to drive him away.

        “I… Ouch!” Although Dodo tried to explain, his words were disrupted by the object that hit him. The room descended into chaos for a moment until the Penguin Druid came.

        “Dodo! Out of the igloo now!” The Penguin Druid grabbed Dodo’s shoulder and pushed him toward the igloo’s entrance.

        “But…”

        “You’ll only agitate her by staying here. Both of you need a moment to calm down.”

        “I… Okay.” Following the Penguin Druid’s advice, Dodo left the igloo. Right before he stepped out of the room, he saw the Penguin Druid gently draw Sasa in her arms to comfort her. He heard her crying inconsolably, which filled his heart with inexplicable emotions.

        ‘I jumped to the conclusion too quickly and misjudged her. I hurt her when she didn’t do anything wrong.’ After a moment of hesitation and inner struggle, Dodo decided to wait outside the igloo. He stayed in the snow for the entire night until the first light of dawn jolted him awake.

        Dodo rubbed his eyes. Just as he was about to head to the river to wash his face, he caught a glimpse of a petite figure walking out of the igloo.

        ‘It’s Sasa!’ Dodo recognized the girl at a glance. Worried that she might hurt herself again, he stealthily followed her and noticed that she was heading toward the river, looking for water to freshen up. However, unfamiliar with the tundra, she accidentally stepped onto an unsafe thin ice.

        As expected, the ice soon broke beneath Sasa’s feet. Just as she was about to fall into the icy river, someone hurried over and caught her. He then leaped onto a safe patch of thick ice before he released his grip on her hand.

        “Are you alright?” Dodo asked, his face filled with concern.

        “...Yes. Thank you.” Despite the terrifying experience with Dodo, Sasa could sense his genuine care at that moment, so she slightly lowered her guard, feeling less hostile than she had been the day before.

        “No-no need to thank me.” Meanwhile, Dodo, who detected Sasa’s softened stance, quickly took the chance to apologize, “I-I misunderstood you earlier. I thought you were hurting the penguin, but you were actually trying to protect him from the seals… It was all my fault. I wrongly accused you, and I’m sorry! Could you forgive me?”

        “...No,” Sasa softly refused after a brief moment of silence.

        ‘Right, it’s only natural. Of course, she wouldn’t forgive me that easily after what I did to her.’ A wry smile tugged at the corner of Dodo’s mouth as he turned around to walk away. However, two hands grabbed the hem of his clothes and stopped him. He lowered his head and saw Sasa’s sparklingly innocent eyes.

        “Unless you take me to see the penguins, then I’ll forgive you.” Sasa shyly smiled.

        “...Of course, I can do that.” It was only then that Dodo felt a great sense of relief, and he responded with a radiant smile.

        “Let’s go see them now!” Sasa eagerly held Dodo’s hand and ran toward the penguins. Meanwhile, the Penguin Druid, already awake, stood by the igloo, watching the two with a warm and doting gaze...</p>
