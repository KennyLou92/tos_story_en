        <h1>Unobtrusive Invasion - Huangdi</h1>
        <p>        It was a sunny day in the Heavenly Kingdom so Huangdi, one of the three Divine Xians moved his chessboard to the pavilion in the courtyard, engrossed in studying the chess game. Enjoying the pleasant warmth of the sun, he even arranged a table filled with exquisite pastries and a pot of fragrant tea warmed by candlelight.

        It was an idyllic afternoon, perfect for contemplating chess puzzles. However, Huangdi’s peaceful musings were abruptly interrupted by a rough push of the door. 

        ‘Only that guy could cause such a commotion,’ Huangdi sighed silently as he raised his head to see a tall and tanned man striding toward him—Chiyou, one of the three Divine Xians.

        “Chiyou, what has caused such a panic?” Huangdi set down his chess pieces and looked at Chiyou, who seemed visibly distressed.

        “Something big has happened, of course!” Chiyou exclaimed, slamming himself down on the opposite seat of Huangdi. He unceremoniously grabbed a teacup and poured himself some tea, gulping it down as if he had not drunk for a long time.

        Huangdi felt a pang of sadness for his precious tea being treated so casually. Holding his aching forehead, he said, “And what is it?”

        “Three days ago, a Xian fell into a deep sleep and hadn’t been awake since then. At first, everyone thought that he might just have been overworked. However, for the last two days, more Xians have experienced the same symptoms, and over twenty Xians have fallen unconscious up until this morning!”

        “What?” Huangdi’s expression immediately turned grave upon hearing such extraordinary news. He asked, “Has this been reported to Yuanshi Tianzun and the others?”

        “Not yet. Yuanshi Tianzun is currently in seclusion, Taishang Laojun has gone to the astro palace, Tongtian Jiaozhu, as usual, is nowhere to be seen, probably gallivanting around the human realm again. That’s why all the Xians have come to me…” Chiyou spoke with a look of puzzlement on his face, “But why haven’t they come to you and Yandi?”

        ‘That’s because you’re simple-minded, compassionate, and easy to talk to, so everyone knows they can just throw their problems at you.’ Huangdi, of course, did not voice his inner thoughts. Instead, he wore a serious expression and continued, “Well, let’s put that question aside. Take me to those unconscious Xians and see if we can find out the cause.”

        And so, Chiyou led Huangdi to the palace to visit the unconscious Xians—it was He Xian’gu, a senior Xian.

        “He’er, how are they?” Chiyou called out gently, and He Xian’gu turned around to greet them.

        “They still haven’t awakened, but thankfully, their condition hasn’t worsened,” He Xian’gu reported with a heavy expression. She looked at Huangdi and said, “We didn’t want to disturb you, but the situation is beyond our knowledge. We couldn’t figure out the cause despite repeated investigations, which is why we asked Chiyou to find you.”

        “No need to worry about disturbing me. It is my responsibility to address the problem in the Heavenly Kingdom. Let me take a look,” Huangdi said. As soon as he approached one of the sleeping Xians, he sketched an intricate symbol in the air, with Xian energy flowing between his fingertips.

        Extending a finger to touch the sleeping Xian, he closed his eyes and focused his mind. After a moment, he withdrew his finger, deep in thought with an expression so grave that left Chiyou and He Xian’gu anxious.

        “What’s wrong with them? Don’t keep us in suspense!” implored the impatient Chiyou.

        “Patient. Give me a moment to think,” Huangdi pondered for a while before finally speaking, “Their bodies are fine, but half of their souls are missing as if they have been imprisoned elsewhere. We must find them as soon as possible, or they may never wake up again.”

        “What?! Who did that?!” Chiyou exclaimed.

        “Yeah, Huangdi, can you tell where the culprit is? Let’s go find them immediately.”

        “Don’t panic. Let me investigate once more with my soul,” Huangdi closed his eyes again, touching his forehead with two fingers. A faint thread of light appeared on his fingertips and stretched as he moved his fingers away to touch the forehead of the sleeping Xian. The thread then dissolved and disappeared.

        The thread of light was a fragment of Huangdi’s soul, allowing him to connect to the Xian’s body and trace the location of the lost soul using the connection.  However, such Xian art was spiritually draining, and within moments, Huangdi was covered in cold sweat. Nevertheless, he did not disappoint the others. He said wearily, “I’ve found them. They’re near the waterfall in the mountains at the back of the Heavenly Kingdom.”

        “Then let’s hurry,” Chiyou turned toward the door, and He Xian’gu wanted to join them, but Huangdi stopped her. “You stay here and guard the unconscious Xians, in case it is some kind of the culprit’s tricks.”

        “...Alright, be careful, both of you.”

        After nodding in acknowledgment, Huangdi and Chiyou turned and leaped toward the location of the waterfall.

        However, before they reached their destination, a dense mist suddenly surged in front of them and enveloped everything in a thick haze, separating Huangdi and Chiyou amidst the mist.

        ‘This is the Stone Sentinel Maze… Humph! Such petty tricks can’t stop me!’ Huangdi sneered, raising two fingers to gather his power. A brilliant light burst forth, precisely shattering the stones that triggered the illusion array. The mist dissipated, revealing a night sky instead of the midday sun.

        The moon, round as a silver disc, hung high in the sky, casting a shimmering and silky hue upon the waterfall. Standing before the waterfall was a graceful figure, exuding an otherworldly charm.

        “I knew the Stone Sentinel Maze couldn’t stop you, Huangdi. You’re still clever and extraordinary as ever,” the young woman smiled enchantingly, her eyes sparkling with waves of allure. Yet, what astonished Huangdi was not the woman’s beauty but her identity.

        “...Tongyu… My sister-in-law… What are you doing here?” Huangdi asked with his eyes widened in shock, his usual mask of composure shattered.

        Tongyu seemed amused by Huangdi’s stunned reaction. With a joyful smile, she walked gracefully toward Huangdi, touching his chest with her slender fingers. Sweetly, she chuckled, “I came to find you, of course.”

        After some time to process, Huangdi finally collected himself. He looked around and noticed the translucent figures floating near the waterfall—those were the souls of the sleeping Xians. Alert, he took a step back from Tongyu and asked sternly, “So, you’re the one who has imprisoned the Xians’ souls?”

        “Yes, but I did it all for you. Back then, you had feelings for me. Yet, I broke your heart when I married your brother, causing you to turn to the path of cultivation. Now I know that you’re the one I truly love, so I came for you,” Tongyu explained.

        Tongyu approached Huangdi again, letting her voluptuously soft body lean toward his arms. With a delicate fragrance permeating through her skin, she softly whispered, “By consuming the Xians’ souls, I can achieve Xian-hood and be with you. Don’t you want us to be together forever, my love?”


        Huangdi remained silent in Tongyu’s embrace. Her emergence evoked memories from the past that flooded back like an irresistible wave, forcing him to close his eyes. After a moment, he let out a deep sigh and placed his hands on her shoulders to gently push her away.

        “What's wrong? Don’t you love me anymore?”

        “...Tongyu, you are indeed the long-awaited wish of my past, but I have come to realize that my goal is to protect all living beings. Besides, you are not Tongyu.”

        Huangdi opened his eyes, clear and bright, seeing through the illusion before him. He firmly said, “You are just a wicked demon disguised as her. The real Tongyu would never cheat on my brother nor harm the innocent for her own gain!”

        “Tut! You’re such a fool for love. You left me no choice. Now perish!” Tongyu’s expression completely changed, turning cold and ruthless. She quickly formed hand seals, gathering her power to attack Huangdi.

        Unfortunately, Huangdi, well-prepared, deflected her attack. Relentlessly, she took advantage of the opportunity to break free from his grasp and once again summoned her power to attack him. Unfazed, Huangdi conjured a protective shield and pulled out a talisman. With a burst of green light, the talisman transformed into multiple arrows made of branches that shot toward the fake Tongyu.

        “Humph! I may have lost this time but I’ll beat you in our next fight!” Tongyu agilely evaded Huangdi’s attacks while attempting to escape. However, Huangdi remained calm and confident, smiling as he shouted to the sky, “It’s time to work! Come out and catch her!”

        “What?!” By the time Tongyu realized something was amiss, it was too late. Someone swiftly pounced on her and firmly captured her with his muscular arms.

        “Chiyou, what took you so long? I have to teach you how to break the Stone Sentinel Maze faster after we get back.”

        “Don’t bother. You’ve taught me countless times before. It just doesn’t stick in my head. I just forcibly broke through it,” Chiyou pointed at the struggling Tongyu and asked Huangdi in confusion, “By the way, who exactly is she?” 

        “...She should be my inner demon,” Huangdi replied.

        “What? Ho-how did you know?!” Tongyu asked in astonishment. It was when she saw the knowing expression on Huangdi’s face that she realized that what he had said was a bluff.

        “Inner demon? Is it the same as the one that appeared when I accidentally shattered the Heart Demon Jade?” Chiyou asked. Several days ago, Chiyou accidentally broke the Heart Demon Jade when he was moving mythical artifacts out of the Treasure Pagoda, which allowed his inner demon to materialize in the realm. Fortunately, Huangdi managed to help him seal the jade again to prevent any mishaps.

        “Yes. I probably unintentionally touched the jade and gave my inner demon a chance to materialize when I sealed the jade.”

        “So, what do we do now? Should we seal her back in the jade?”

        “No. I have thoroughly sealed the jade earlier. Undoing the seal now might cause more trouble,” said Huangdi while examining Tongyu. An eerie smile suddenly tugged at his lips, sending shivers down the demon’s spine.

        “Well, I happen to need a guardian spirit for my secret realm. I’ll just have her guard it for me since she has nothing to do,” Huangdi recalled something and continued, “You probably don’t have a name and it’s awkward to use my sister-in-law’s name… Umm, let’s call you Xiao Yu then.”

        “What? That’s so lame! I’m not— Mmm!” Xiao Yu’s objection was mercilessly interrupted by a restraining curse cast by Huangdi.

        Afterward, Huangdi sent the missing souls back to the sleeping Xians’ bodies while smirking, thinking to himself, ‘Perfect, now I have a guardian spirit for free.’</p>
