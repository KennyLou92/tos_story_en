        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 2

        In a spacious cavern at the end of a rocky passage, several colossal beasts roughly threw Mistilteinn the gladiospina to the ground. The impact tore through her wounds, causing blood to drip again. Still, it failed to rouse her from the stupor induced by the butterfly elves’ sleeping powder.

        However, even in her hazy slumber, Mistilteinn had an inexplicable intuition that told her to protect her abdomen, for she sensed a gentle warmth emanating from within.

        ‘This feels just like when I conceived Gram… There’s another life growing inside me. I must protect my child!’

        The maternal instinct to protect her child compelled Mistilteinn to awaken from her daze. She opened her eyes only to behold a terrifying countenance mere inches away from her face—a ferocious beast baring its menacingly sharp fangs. Its putrid breath filled the air, yet it failed to elicit any fear from Mistilteinn.

        Far from being disappointed, the beast, having a colossal tail, was rather intrigued by her reaction, and he said, “You’re awake, Mistilteinn the gladiospina.”

        “...Zeboiim the phantocauda. I see you’ve fallen rather far. How pathetic you have become, stooping so low to conspire with the butterfly elves just to capture me with such a slimy scheme,” Mistilteinn retorted, a mocking smile tugging at the corners of her lips as she gazed at Zeboiim.

        Several days ago, Mistilteinn happened to witness the phantocaudas’ onslaught against the butterfly elves on her way back to the gladiospinas’ abode. Finding the sight unbearably brutal, she stepped in and helped the surviving elves escape. She planned to rally her fellow gladiospinas and rescue the captive elves from the phantocaudas’ clutches. Little did she know she would be betrayed by the butterfly elf leader, Evander, who rendered her unconscious by applying sleeping powder on her wounds left from her heroic act and turned her into the phantocaudas’ chieftain, Zeboiim.

        “Heh, the result justifies the means, no matter how despicable they may be,” Zeboiim remarked,  “And besides, it was extremely amusing to fool those dumb butterfly elves. Killing two bugs with one stone, so to speak.”

        “...So, you broke your promise and killed the butterfly elves you held captive,” Mistilteinn said. Her face darkened and her gaze turned cold.

        “They were the ones who sold you to me. Why would you be angry about their death?” asked Zeboiim, whose eyes gleamed with delight as he recalled something amusing. “The look of despair and resentment on Evander’s foolish face when he saw the corpses of his kin… Just think of it as…their price for betraying you, don’t you like it?”

        “The butterfly elves were merely victims of circumstance.  I don’t resent them for their betrayal; I pity their vulnerability,” Mistilteinn said.

        “You’re truly kind, so kind that it makes me sick,” Zeboiim remarked, finding Mistilteinn’s unwavering composure rather uninteresting. He flicked his tail in displeasure, stirring a cloud of dust, “Well, enough small talk. Let’s get down to business.”

        Zeboiim’s eyes narrowed, and his massive tail agilely extended from behind him, coiling around the sword on Mistilteinn’s back. Yet, he did not pull it out right away; instead, he tauntingly slowed his speech, “I’ve always wanted a weapon that suits me, and the core sword of a gladiospina may be a perfect fit, so I’m thinking maybe I’ll just use yours.”

        Gladiospinas are dragons that are born in the likeness of a sword and slumber until the passage of time stirs their awakening. When they begin to develop sentience, they take on a hybrid form, part dragon and part human, and only after a period of training do they unveil their true essence as a dragon. In their complete dragon form, the very core of the gladiospina, bearing the name of the core sword, anchors upon their body and becomes an epitome of indomitable might as it harmonizes with the gladiospina’s growth and amasses a reservoir of magic powers.

        Yet, great power often comes at a price. If the core sword is destroyed or forcibly removed, the gladiospina will be left devoid of will, reduced to a mere shell, a walking corpse. 

        “Wait.”

        “What is it? Are you finally begging for mercy?” Zeboiim taunted.

        “No, I want to make a deal with you.” 

        “A deal?” Zeboiim was first surprised by Mistilteinn’s answer, but he soon sneered, “What do you, a defenseless prisoner, have to offer in a deal with me?”

        “Don’t you want another core sword?” Mistilteinn asked.

        “What do you mean?”

        “I’m pregnant. You can have a second core sword soon if you don’t remove mine now.”

        “...HAHA!” Zeboiim fell into a momentary silence before bursting into uproarious laughter. “Mistilteinn, it turns out you’re just as selfish as those butterfly elves. No, you’re even worse; Evander betrayed you for his family’s lives, but you just sold your own child simply to live a few days longer.”

        “So, do we have a deal?”

        “Of course! I can’t wait to see the look on Tyrfing’s face when I kill him with your core swords!” Zeboiim exclaimed, his excitement causing his breath to quicken. But soon, he regained his composure and cast a bemused look at Mistilteinn, saying, “However, to keep us safe, we must treat you with ‘care’. Don’t worry, you won’t die.”

        “Men! Bring our esteemed guest to the dungeon and keep her chained up!” he commanded.

        And so, the phantocaudas dragged Mistilteinn to a bleak and tiny dungeon. They pinned her to the wall with heavy chains that pierced through her wings, trapping the gladiospina that had used to soar through the skies in the cramped room..

        Blood continued to ooze from Mistilteinn’s harrowing wounds, filling the narrow dungeon with a putrid stench. Despite the gnawing pain, she still mustered a smile and gently stroked her still-flat abdomen.

        ‘Great, I’ve managed to protect you. Don’t worry, my baby, I’ll do anything to bring you into this world.’

        From that moment onward, Mistilteinn remained true to her promise. She persevered through the phantocaudas’ brutal torture and the throbbing agony of the infected wounds in her wings, painstakingly nurturing her unborn child. Feeling her child grow day by day became her only solace and source of hope.

        And one day, someone came to share in her hope—a young, petite phantocauda with three tails. She stood at the dungeon entrance. Radiating confidence and pride, she looked at Mistilteinn without any fear, even though the latter was much larger than her.

        “Who are you?” Mistilteinn asked, though she already had an answer as she saw the three tails behind the young phantocauda. 

        Phantocaudas are beasts distinguished by their unique tails. When a phantocauda comes into the world, they boast five tails, each a testament to their nascent power.  Yet, as the phantocauda grows in strength, a wondrous transformation takes place—their tails gradually merge and meld, becoming one, symbolizing their unparalleled prowess. As the leader of the phantocaudas, Zeboiim, of course, was the top of his kind, possessing a solitary, resplendent tail. But even possessing three tails is no ordinary feat, especially considering the tender age of the phantocauda before Mistilteinn.

        “I’m Gomorrah. My father said you have my sword inside your belly. Is it true?” said Gomorrah, her excitement explicitly shown by her incessantly swaying tails. 

        ‘So she is Zeboiim’s daughter, just as I guessed… But she seems nothing like her father; she still has kindness within her…’ Mistilteinn’s expression softened as she spoke gently to Gomorrah. “Yes, there is another life inside me. Would you like to feel it?”

        “Can I?”

        Mistilteinn nodded, and Gomorrah cautiously lifted her forepaw to touch the gladiospina’s protruding abdomen. She felt a powerful heartbeat from within and immediately exclaimed in joy, “I can feel it!”

        “Yes, and you will meet her soon,” Mistilteinn said.

        Just like Mistilteinn said, not long after, she gave birth to her daughter, whom she named Joan. However, the baby gladiospina still needed power and time to wake from her slumber. During that time, Gomorrah frequently visited Mistilteinn, brimming with excitement, as they awaited Joan’s awakening together.

        Finally, several months later, in the early morning hours, under Mistilteinn’s watchful gaze, Joan transitioned from a core sword to her hybrid form, manifesting into a young girl of around thirteen or fourteen years old.

        “Mo…Mom?” The girl instinctively reached out and embraced Mistilteinn.

        The prolonged captivity and torture had taken a devastating toll on Mistilteinn. The once majestic dragon had wilted, skin and meat desperately clinging onto her exposed skeleton, and her morbidly red wounds seeped with the putrid stench of infection. Yet, even amidst such indescribable anguish, during these months, not a single tear had escaped her resilient gaze. It was only at that moment, as she beheld her daughter’s awakening, that her composure shattered and tears began cascading down her face. In a trembling voice filled with profound love, she whispered, “Yes, yes… Mommy is here... My precious daughter, Joan…”

        However, their heartwarming union was quickly interrupted as Zeboiim arrived at the dungeon with his subordinates after learning that the other gladiospina had awakened.

        “Well done, Mistilteinn! Your daughter awakens at the perfect moment, just as we intend to attack the gladiospinas. Now I can finally make good use of your core sword to ‘entertain’ your kin,” Zeboiim sneered maliciously as he approached Mistilteinn, casting a glance at one of his subordinates.

        Knowingly, Zeboiim’s subordinate seized Joan, who clung desperately to Mistilteinn. Joan struggled with all her might, but she was too young and weak to resist the phantocaudas’ strength, so she could only let them tear her away from her mother.

        “Don’t worry. I’ll take good care of your daughter. I’ll make sure she grows up to be the perfect weapon for Gomorrah, my daughter,” Zeboiim said, “Oh, and I’ve also taken the liberty of naming her. She will be called Sodom. It has a nice ring to it, don’t you think?”

        “...If you’re going to kill me, just do it now,” Mistilteinn said, unperturbed. Her calm demeanor surprised Zeboiim, leaving him suspicious for a moment. However, her frail countenance soon dispelled any doubts he had.

        Zeboiim then coiled his tail around the core sword on Mistilteinn’s back, preparing to extract it. But in a sudden surge of energy, Mistilteinn violently slammed into him regardless of her impaled wings. She pressed Zeboiim against the wall, and at the same time, her core sword began emitting an ominous crimson glow as cracks began to form along the blade.

        “Even if I die, I won’t let you use my core sword to murder my kin!” Mistilteinn shouted, tearing down her calm facade and displaying a desperate resolve.

        Boom!

        Mistilteinn’s core sword exploded, unleashing a burst of blinding light and a shockwave that struck Mistilteinn herself. Her consciousness began fading away as her core sword shattered. At that moment, she thought of her daughter, the young child who was still ignorant of the world, and a tear trickled down her cheek.

        ‘I’m sorry…Joan, my poor daughter. I brought you into the world filled with suffering, knowing that I would leave you on a difficult path. Therefore, I shall only pray, with aching sorrow, that the primordial dragons will protect you and guide you through all hardships, and lead you toward a future full of hope…’</p>
