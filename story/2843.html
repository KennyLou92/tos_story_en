        <h1>Infinite Athenaeum - Abhoth</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.8

        From the depths of the cosmos, a metallic dragon gracefully arrived at the center of Tarones, cradling another dragon of a deep purple hue in its embrace. The slumbering dragon seemed lost in dreams, its eyes tightly shut.

        “Azathoth, we’re almost there. I’ve chosen the very place where our paths first crossed as your resting ground. Do you like it?” The metallic dragon—Daoloth, the lord of creation, whispered softly. Deep in slumber, of course, Azathoth offered no response, revealing a rare side of silence.

        Daoloth descended gently to the earth, and no sooner had it touched the ground than a vibrant blue figure approached—it was Abhoth, a follower of creation.

        “Daoloth, what happened? What…what happened to Azathoth?”

        Daoloth did not answer Abhoth's question. Instead, it devoted all its attention solely to Azathoth; it gently lay Azathoth down and even created an everlasting garden of blossoms for it, using the powers of creation. It was only after ensuring Azathoth’s well-being that Daoloth turned to face Abhoth, its platinum eyes filled with piercing insight and knowledge.

        “You already knew the answer, didn’t you?”

        “...I can never hide anything from you, my dear lord of creation,” said Abhoth. Ripples formed within its watery essence as its thoughts were shaken by Daoloth’s words. However, rippling soon subsided, for it knew that its actions would remain the same for its fervent pursuit of the world’s truth, even if it meant enraging Daoloth.

        In a fortuitous encounter with Ithaqua, the embodiment of fate, Abhoth learned that there existed not just one world, but countless realms beyond its perception, each distinct from the present reality. It yearned for the knowledge of all these realms, only to realize its own insignificance and fragility which made it incapable of bearing the weight of such voluminous information. 

        To attain a revolutionary evolution, Abhoth needed Daoloth to transcend its degradation and acquire the power to traverse dimensions. Only then could it become stronger and undergo its own transformation For that purpose, Abhoth conspired with Y’golonac, orchestrating the encounter between Azathoth and Daoloth.

        Moreover, it manipulated Y’golonac and Mordiggian, using Ghatanothoa and Atlach to destabilize Azathoth. For it knew that Daoloth would go to any lengths to save Azathoth, and thus be willing to cooperate with it.

        “Abhoth, so you have forsaken everything in pursuit of truth.”

        “Just the way you save Azathoth, Daoloth.”

        Boom! The earth behind Abhoth trembled as Daoloth’s strike created a deep crater.

        Narrowing its eyes, Daoloth exuded an overwhelming aura and declared, “Don’t compare your wretchedness to me. Disappear before my true wrath descends.”

        “No, I won’t leave, for you need me,” Abhoth stated fearlessly. “Given that everyone is gone now, I am the only one who can help you realize your plan.”

        “...I’m listening.”

        “Since this realm offers no means to save Azathoth, we must seek the answer in other realms. The transcendental power bestowed upon you by Azathoth enables your soul to traverse dimensions. However, gathering the truths of the realms will take a lot of time, even for you.”

        “So, you wish to become an entity that collects and stores the truths?” Daoloth cast a disdainful smirk, lowering its gaze upon Abhoth. “Can you shoulder such weight?”

        “Whether I fail or succeed, it will be no harm to you. Am I right?”

        “Indeed.” Daoloth nodded, extending its metallic claws within which the transcendental power gathered, entwined, and finally compressed into a seed radiating a swirling darkness. Then, it continued, “Since you are willing to give everything for this opportunity, we shall let fate decide whether the misfortune you endure will bring forth the miracle you desire.”

        Before Abhoth could respond, Daoloth implanted the seed directly into its being.

        The transcendental power swiftly coursed through Abhoth’s entire body. It first dissolved its flesh, then shattered its soul, consuming every fragment one by one.

        Nourished by its Abhoth’s essence, the seed sprouted. Its tendrils broke through the boundaries of dimensions, finding its place within the crevices between realms. Slowly, it grew and bore countless dandelion-like buds in this peculiar space.

        When the buds matured, they burst open, releasing seeds imbued with powers, carried away to different worlds. They took root again, recording and witnessing the histories and truths of each world.

        The buds would transmit the information back to their parents who would automatically transcribe them and transform them into books that would find their eternal abode on endless shelves—the enigmatic place henceforth known as the “Bibliotheca of Truth”.

        Under the silent gaze of fate, Abhoth, despite losing its flesh and cognition, got its wish, obtaining knowledge and truths from various realms.

        It was after an arduous passage of time that Daoloth finally discovered a method to save Azathoth. To accomplish its plan, it asked Abhoth to select destined individuals in Tarones, imparting upon them the selected histories and knowledge. However, something unexpected happened during the execution.

        To continue the plan, Daoloth returned to the continent of Tarones, assuming the identity of Tawil. It was with Ithaqua’s guidance that it regained its lost memories and finally fulfill the promise it had made to Azathoth…</p>
