        <h1>Ruinous Goat - Baphomet</h1>
        <p>        There was a rumor that Baphomet held a library of forbidden knowledge. Whoever mastered the knowledge would acquire exceptional power. So a rapacious sorcerer set up a trap and captured Baphomet in an enchantment so as to steal his knowledge.

        ‘Give me your knowledge and I shall give you your freedom,’ said the sorcerer gloatingly to Baphomet. He even hoped that Baphomet would repulse him, then he could satisfy his sadistic desire by torturing the latter.

        As much as Baphomet despised that human who imprisoned him, he was fully aware that he could not resist, for he knew that the human wouldn’t let him live even if he handed over all his knowledge. Thus he came up with a fiendish plan that could lead the human into self-destruction…

        ‘Of course. Sorcerer, your greatness, I can give you anything you want. The question is, what do you want? The location of all the hidden treasure? Or the power of devastation?’

        Under the voice of Baphomet, numerous pictures flashed across the sorcerer’s mind—he became the greatest sorcerer in the world, omnipotent and invincible, and everyone was falling at his feet…

        ‘Give me the power!’ Rashly, the sorcerer shouted at Baphomet with his eyes reddened.

        ‘Sure. I can teach you the forbidden spells.’ Keeping his mockery to himself, Baphomet left the second part of his words unsaid—“only at a little price.”

        So Baphomet taught the sorcerer a set of spells and told him that he could strengthen his magic by using the spells constantly, and eventually he could rule over everything.

        At first, the sorcerer didn’t take Baphomet’s word completely. He only tested the Baphomet’s spells under layers of protection and he kept checking his own body afterward to ensure his own safety.

        However, as the sorcerer’s magic power grew rapidly, he no longer questioned Baphomet’s spells. He stopped studying and analyzing the spells; instead, he started using them frequently just like what Baphomet had told him at the beginning.

        Engrossed by the satisfaction of growing power, the sorcerer gradually fell in the grip of pursuing power. Consequently, he noticed a small crack on his body after using the spells one day.

        Nonetheless, he didn’t care, for he had already lost control by then.

        The sorcerer’s heart was already preoccupied with madness and destructive desire. The more so, the more difficult it was for him to restrain himself from using the forbidden spells.

        Finally, one day, the sorcerer died in an explosion and wound up in chunks of meat as his body failed to withhold that disproportionate power. Following the sorcerer’s demise, the enchantment that trapped Baphomet disappeared. The latter then left with a bellow of derisive laughter.

        “The blind pursuit and impercipient use of knowledge only leads to the depths of a chasm.”</p>
