        <h1>Florescent Grace - He Xian'gu</h1>
        <p>
                A mournful and sorrowful tune of the guqin emanated from Xiao Zi’s home, resonating throughout the Heavenly Kingdom. As beautiful and enchanting as the melody was, no one could appreciate it any longer after listening to it continuously for three days and three nights.

        Driven to the brink of despair, all the Xians finally decided to take action—they went to He Xian’gu’s residence, begging her to have a closure with Xiao Zi. Without a proper reason to refuse, He Xian’gu reluctantly made her way to Xiao Zi’s music room.

        As soon as He Xian’gu stepped into the music room, she saw Xiao Zi playing the guqin with a pitiful and delicate demeanor while tears streaming down her cheeks.

        “...Xian’gu, boo hoo…” Xiao Zi stopped playing the guqin the moment she saw He Xian’gu, and tears began to pour from her eyes like water coming out from a broken dam.

        “Please, stop crying.” He Xian’gu felt a growing headache watching  Xiao Zi suddenly bursting into tears.

        “How could I stop… I can’t believe that you asked Chiyou to pretend to be your lover just to get rid of me...”

        He Xian’gu let out a long sigh, “I’ve told you so many times. Chiyou and I are really in love. Didn’t I already prove it to you before?”

        “I don’t buy it!” said Xiao Zi. With a calculating look in her eyes, she said, “There’s a rumor that in the hidden forest near the kingdom, there’s a special kind of twinflower that only blooms when true lovers are present. I’ll believe you if you bring one back, and I will leave you alone from then on. But, if you fail to bring it back…You can never stop me from pursuing you!”

        “Why do I have to prove myself to you—” Before He Xian’gu could finish her sentence, Xiao Zi began playing her mournful song again, which only intensified He Xian’gu’s headache, leaving her no choice but to surrender and say, “Fine, twinflower it is. I will pluck it for you, but you have to stop playing the guqin!”

        However, He Xian’gu immediately felt a sense of regret as she stepped out of Xiao Zi’s house.

        “How am I supposed to make the twinflower bloom without a true lover… Nevermind, I’ll figure it out later.”

        Lost in her contemplation, He Xian’gu nearly collided with a figure, and it turned out to be Chiyou.

        “Chiyou? What are you doing here?”

        “I saw you walking into Xiao Zi’s house looking troubled. She didn’t do anything inappropriate to you, did she?” asked Chiyou, furrowing his brows lightly, his face filled with concern.

        Noticing the genuine care in Chiyou’s words, He Xian’gu felt a warm wave wash over her heart, which relieved her weary nerves, and she said, “Xiao Zi won’t stop pursuing me unless I pluck the twinflower to prove myself, but it is said that the twinflower only blooms for true lovers…”

        “So you’re worried about how to make the flower bloom, correct? Well, it’s simple. I have a solution!” Chiyou answered confidently, thumping his chest.

        Soon after, Chiyou led He Xian’gu to retrieve a pot-shaped artifact from the Treasure Pagoda. The pot had the power to stimulate plant growth, and thus it could force the twin-flower to blossom, even without true love.

        The two Xians descended to the human realm, arriving at the sanctuary in a secluded forest. Along the way, they encountered monsters who wanted to attack them. However, all of them cowered in a corner and trembled with fear upon catching sight of He Xian’gu’s fierce gaze.

        Just like that, He Xian’gu and Chiyou successfully made it to the depths of the sanctuary where they quickly found a flower with two buds in its calyx. He Xian’gu knew at first sight that this was the twinflower she had been seeking. She gently plucked the flower and transferred it into the pot along with the surrounding soil.

        “Perfect! Now all we have to do is wait for the buds to bloom with the power of the pot, and everything will be resolved!” He Xian’gu let out a sigh of relief and turned to Chiyou, her face adorned with a radiant smile which was so captivating that it made Chiyou’s heart skip a beat and his blood race. 

        “He’er, I—” Overwhelmed by the surging emotions, Chiyou was about to say something but his body suddenly stiffened. In the next moment, he swiftly lunged toward He Xian’gu and enveloped her within his own body.

        A large amount of dust descended from above, pouring down on Chiyou. In his attempt to protect He Xian’gu, he was caught off guard and inadvertently inhaled some of the dust. Immediately, he felt his strength drain away, as if all the energy was being sucked out of his body. Slowly, he slipped down from He Xian’gu’s body.

        Just then, a vine emerged from the shadows, curling around the incapacitated Chiyou. He Xian’gu tried to grab him but was a step too late. She could only watch as Chiyou was drawn into someone’s embrace.

        “You’re…a flower demon! Why did you capture him?”

        With an indolent glance at He Xian’gu, the flower demon casually waved her hand, as if shooing away a bug, and said, “I am the queen of this sanctuary. Anyone who wants to take something from within must leave something behind in exchange. This man is so handsome; I want to make him my husband. You may just take the twinflower and leave.”

        He Xian’gu’s face darkened upon hearing the flower demon. She raised the pot, offering it to the flower demon, “I won’t take the flower. Release him.”

        The flower demon responded with a displeased snort. With a flick of her hand, a vine suddenly lunged toward He Xian’gu, pierced through the pot and forcefully threw it aside.

        “Oh dear, it’s all your fault. Now that the flower is lost, I’m going to keep this man,” the flower demon spoke while caressing Chiyou's face with infatuation. “Hehe, my husband is truly a hot one.”

        At that moment, Xian’gu felt every nerve in her body ignited by a flame called “rage”.

        “Release him, now.” He Xian’gu spoke each word with a deep, resonant tone, lower than her usual voice. If there were any familiar Cianss who knew He Xian’gu’s temperament, they would know that this was a precursor to her fury, and they would wisely flee. But the flower demon, of course, was oblivious to it all.

        “How dare you try to interrupt my time with my husband! Die!” The flower demon summoned her demonic power, commanding her vines to gather from all directions, entrapping He Xian’gu within a cage of foliage.

        “I am invincible within this sanctuary!” The flower demon gloated, leaning against Chiyou to kiss his cheek. However, a surge of Xian energy broke through the cage of entwined vines, with a radiant brilliance shooting into the sky.

        “He will never be your husband! Because he is mine!” He Xian’gu resolutely shouted. With a powerful kick against the ground, she instantaneously appeared in front of the flower demon before she could react.  In a swift motion, He Xian’gu struck the demon with a forceful right punch to the face.

        The flower demon’s face contorted upon the impact, her hands involuntarily released their grip due to the intense pain. Chiyou inevitably fell out of her arms while she was forcefully propelled backward, crashing into several trees before slumping onto the ground. However, it was only the beginning of He Xian’gu’s attack, who did not give the flower demon a moment to catch her breath as she closed in once again—

        With the combination of uppercuts, jabs, spinning kicks, and roundhouse kicks, each attack infused with Xian power, He Xian’gu inflicted excruciating pain upon the flower demon, causing her agony beyond comprehension.

        After what felt like an eternity, He Xian’gu finally concluded her overpowering assault. She gracefully stepped forward and squatted before the flower demon, wearing a generous and beautiful smile. She used a finger to lift the swollen chin of the demon and softly asked, “Tell me, who does he belong to?”

        “You… He…he belongs to you… I was wrong… I didn’t know any better…”

        “Good. Now hand over the antidote.”

        In desperation for mercy, the flower demon took out a vial and handed it over to He Xian’gu, who took it and turned around without giving the demon another glance. She then walked to Chiyou and poured the antidote into his mouth.

        After a moment, Chiyou finally opened his eyes, and He Xian’gu anxiously asked, “Are you... alright?”

        “I’m fine. It was so embarrassing that I got ambushed by that demon.”

        “No, you did it all to protect me.” He Xian’gu gazed at Chiyou, her eyes filled with guilt and a hint of affection. “It was me who has been burdening you all this time... I will explain everything to Xiao Zi.”

        Chiyou did not say a word but only gazed at He Xian’gu, leaving her puzzled. Just as she was about to voice her question, Chiyou finally spoke, his voice carrying a husky tone of intoxication, “He’er, what did you mean by what you said to the flower demon just now?”

        “Huh? Which part?”

        “When…when you said that I belong to you…” A blush spread across Chiyou’s cheeks, his eyes filled with anticipation and joy.

        “Yo-yo-you heard that?!” He Xian’gu blushed in embarrassment and stumbled over her words. But soon, her determination overcame her shyness. 

        She glared at Chiyou, although her cheeks were as red as an apple, and said, “Well, yes, I just happen to like you! Is there a problem?”

        Chiyou was initially stunned by her answer, but he quickly recovered and broke into a wide smile, his mouth stretched happily, resembling a child who had gotten his wish.

        “Of course not, because I like you too.”

        As Chiyou’s words trailed off, a beam of light shimmered nearby. Two vibrant buds grew within the radiance, continuously expanding until they reached the size of towering trees. They unfurled their delicate petals, blooming magnificently and releasing a fragrant aroma into the air.

        The rich scent even wafted through the Heavenly Kingdom. As the single Xian soldiers turned their attention to the resplendent display of the colossal twin flowers, their hearts were filled with a mix of bitterness and envy, resenting the shameless couple for creating such a grand public display of affection.

        Only Xiao Zi, who knew the intricacies of the situation, understood what was behind the unfolding spectacle, which also indicated the end of her unrequited love. She soon left the Heavenly Kingdom and embarked on a journey in the human realm to heal her broken heart without waiting for He Xian’gu and Chiyou to return…</p>
