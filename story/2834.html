        <h1>Unresolved Repentance - Hyacinth</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.2

        Hyacinth finally became the host of the Century Feast as he had wished. However, little did he know that his wife, Paperwhite, would expose his lies in front of the nobles on the day of the feast and let them pin him to the ground like a criminal as they lost trust in him.

        Paperwhite, who had been nothing but caring and loving to Hyacinth, simply stood on the side and watched her husband die of embarrassment, gloating over his failure.

        As a matter of fact, Hyacinth and Paperwhite were very much alike: they both had a complex about themselves. The only difference between them was that she showed it with timidity while he covered it with arrogance.

        As Hyacinth strenuously lifted his head, he glared at Paperwhite, who was standing in front of him. With his eyes blazing with crimson rage, he roared through clenched teeth, ‘How dare you betray me! I won’t forgive you!’

        ‘I betray you?’ A sardonic smile appeared on Paperwhite’s blandly pale face as though she found Hyacinth’s accusation quite funny. She then slowly opened her mouth which was the only color on her face.

        ‘You’re the traitor in our story… You told me that I could never be the one for you, remember?’ Even though Paperwhite spoke in an extremely soft tone, she sounded as frightening as a slithering snake, and she said, ‘Since I can’t get my wish, you can’t get yours as well—you will never be the king!’

        ‘You—!’ Hyacinth’s rage erupted at Paperwhite’s words. He was mad at the elf in front of him for she had completely ruined everything he had planned for years. The mounting rage gave him a sudden burst of strength that helped him break free from the nobles’ restraint.

        The moment Hyacinth regained freedom, he charged at Paperwhite with lightning speed. Embarrassed and furious, he raised his right hand to give the slender elf a slap but his body froze a second before he did when he saw her glazed eyes.

        “Why… Why is she looking at me like this… Why doesn’t she move or defend herself… It’s like she’s been waiting for me to hurt her and take my revenge on her…”


        Hyacinth’s heart fluttered the second he met Paperwhite’s eyes. Up till then, he still remembered how bright those eyes shone when she held his hands and ran into his arm in her wedding dress on their big day. Every part of her body seemed to tell him how much happiness he had brought him. He thought that she would stay the same forever but now he was proven wrong.

        When did the glow in her eyes begin to dim? What put out her flame of love? Who made her live in despair?

        Suddenly, countless questions struck Hyacinth like a storm and swept him over like a blizzard, but he eventually found the answer——perhaps more precisely—in her eyes.

        In those gloomy eyes was the reflection of a scowling male floral-elf.

        It was him.

        He was the one who forced her to do things and wear clothes that she did not like; he forced her to become someone else. It was he who trampled her heart.

        Something sharp seemed to graze Hyacinth’s heart as he saw the withering Paperwhite. He could not help but feel frustrated and distressed seeing her standing still in front of him despite knowing that he would hit her.

        In the end, Hyacinth did not give Paperwhite the slap. He could not hit her after all even though she had shattered his dream and ruined everything he had earned by fair means or foul.

        It had become his instinct to protect her. She had always been so pitiful and humble from the first day they met. She was like a mirror of him; they both tried everything they could to beg for their loved ones’ attention.

        ‘...Enough.’ Hyacinth withdrew his hand and said in a deep voice, ‘I lost… Just do whatever you want.’

        ‘Why… So you don’t even bother to hate me…’ Paperwhite whispered. The overwhelming resentment for her husband made her choke with tears.

        She could not control herself not to resent the few loving moments he had shown her when he did not even love her; she hated him for giving her hope and allowing her to fantasize about their future… Most of all, she resented how he made her fall in love with his contradictorily awkward tenderness.

        That was why she threw herself before Hyacinth without hesitation when she found an arrow shooting at him from a dark corner—

        Sqwelp!

        The arrow plunged into Paperwhite’s chest. She fell straight back on Hyacinth, who was stunned into a state of turmoil.

        By then, Papaver had broken through the banquet hall doors with her rebel army outside the enchantment. Their leader stormed in with a bow in his hand—it was clear that he was the one who had fired the arrow just now.

        Amid the scene of sudden chaos in the hall, the nobles and the guards protected Paperwhite and Hyacinth. As Paperwhite’s sap seeped through her clothes, it fell into the prince’s hand and wetted his palm.

        It was the touch of the warm liquid that brought Hyacinth back to reality. He held Paperwhite close to his body which was trembling uncontrollably. He panicked. It was the first time he felt so panicked in his life, which he had never felt even when he lost the nobles’ support or his dream of ascending the throne.

        Hyacinth took a deep breath. His eyes seemed to be covered with a thin layer of mist. Trying his best to maintain his voice, he said, ‘Paperwhite, hang in there. We’ll find the doctor now…’

        ‘It’s useless…’ Endless sap kept flowing out of Paperwhite’s body, forming a puddle beneath her. Her breaths began to weaken as a veil of death draped on her awfully pale face.

        With the last strength left in her body, she lifted a hand to caress Hyacinth’s cheek and whispered softly, ‘At least you can never forget me from now on… In the end… I still can’t stop loving you…’

        However, Paperwhite’s eyes closed and her hands dropped before Hyacinth could say anything.

        Hyacinth felt like he was wandering in a void. He shook the body in his arms in disbelief while shouting nervously, ‘Paperwhite! Paperwhite! Hey! Stop faking it! Wake up!’

        However, the elf in his arms could no longer answer him. The fading warmth of her body forced him to face the fact that she was dead.

        In an instant, all the memories Hyacinth had with Paperwhite came flooding back like an album with flying pages: the reassuring words she gave him whenever he was in dejection, the nights of her waiting for him rain or shine, and the changes she made for him. However, cracks began to spread across the pages, turning them into irretrievable pieces.

        ‘No! NO! You can’t leave me alone! You said I’m your only choice! Wake up!’ Hyacinth felt like there was a lump in his throat. His eyes burned and he could hardly breathe as if something was grasping his chest.

        At that moment, he finally felt regret. It was at that exact moment that he realized what he had lost—he lost his wife who had always put him first and given him the most precious love in the world.

        ‘NOOOOOOO—!’ With his hands clinging to Paperwhite’s body, Hyacinth cried bitterly like a madman, hoping that the body in his arms could regain a little of warmth. Stricken with inconsolable grief, he continued to repent of his sins without noticing Nepenthes and Cornflower, who came to the hall with a troop of soldiers…</p>
