        <h1>Creator of Maelstrom - Pontos </h1>
        <p>
                At the gate to the realm of gods, the Court of Ophiuchus defeated Pontos with the help of his companions, Mitty and Marble, the Court of Canis Major and Minor. As Pontos fell to the ground, unconscious, memories from the past flooded back and churned within his chaotic mind, forcing him to relive his past once again…

        Following Khaos’ guidance, the gods arrived on the continent of Tarones and began extracting the power of elements to create a new realm for their kind. After spending several years on the continent, Pontos was summoned back to the realm of gods to join the others in constructing their home. 

        As the master of water elements, Pontos was duly tasked with creating rivers, lakes, and oceans in the new realm. Occasionally, he would also supervise the military and train with them. One day, a sergeant walked up to Pontos with some documents to brief him on the upcoming tasks after the training.

        “Lord Pontos, we need you to create five lakes and ten rivers in the north today,” the sergeant reported nervously, fearing that he would provoke the temperamental Pontos.

        “Tut! More lakes and rivers…” Pontos’ expression turned grim, clicking his tongue in annoyance. With a furrowed brow, he asked, “What comes after that? What else do I have to do?”

        “Well…” The sergeant frantically flipped through the documents and said, “After that, you need to create three rivers and two lakes in the east. Then, you’ll move to the south where we need two waterfalls and one ocean. And finally, eight lakes in the west…”

        “Enough!” Irritation continued to rise in Pontos as he listened. Eventually, he cut short the sergeant’s report. Startled, the sergeant immediately shut his mouth and rigidly stood at attention.


        ‘Create a lake, create a waterfall, create a river… It’s always about water, water, WATER! How boring! The human realm is much more interesting than that. Why do I have to stay here and do these tedious tasks while Zeus that bastard can do whatever he wants in the human realm? That’s enough! I’m going to the human realm today, no matter what!’

        “I’m not doing it today!” The line of Pontos’ thought only provoked resentment within him, so he followed his heart and refused the tasks.

        “Bu-but what if Lord Khaos asks about the progress?!”

        “Just make up some excuses. Anyway, I’m going to the human realm now!” Turning a deaf ear to the sergeant’s urge, Pontos turned around and headed straight for the gate after leaving those words. However, someone intercepted him as he was transported to the lower part of the realm of gods.

        “Lord Pontos, it is Lord Khaos’ order that you’re not allowed to go to the human realm,” said Zeus, the King of Gods, taking a bow. Yet, contrary to his seemingly respectful demeanor, his eyes and tone revealed his arrogance and disdain for Pontos, which only further fueled Pontos’ indignation.

        “I’m going and you can do nothing to stop me!”

        “In that case, please forgive my impudence,” Zeus spoke humbly, but his actions carried a murderous intent as a bolt of lightning materialized in his hand, aiming for Pontos with a menacing momentum—

        Boom!

        A deafening explosion shook the realm, turning everything white momentarily with a blinding light. But soon it faded away, revealing Pontos still standing on the ground despite being struck by the lightning. Some parts of his skin had been scorched, emitting thin wisps of white smoke, and there was nothing more.

        “Tut! Your thunderbolt indeed hurts, but it’s no different than a mosquito bite to me,”  Pontos grinned arrogantly while stretching his muscles. “Now it’s my turn!”

        Pontos’ gaze sharpened as he summoned water elements which swiftly coalesced into multiple water spheres. At his command, all the spheres surged toward Zeus at a fierce speed. However, a mysterious wall made of purple pneuma suddenly appeared before Zeus, blocking all the spheres and melting them one by one.

        “This is…chaotic power!” Pontos quickly recognized the true nature of the purple pneuma. Glaring at Zeus, who held a purple sphere in his hands, Pontos questioned through his clenched teeth, “Why do you possess Khaos’ power?!”

        “It was bestowed upon me by Lord Khaos, of course, to prevent someone as stubborn and ignorant as you from causing trouble. I suggest you go back now before it’s too late.”

        “Humph! No! Why should I listen to the words of a coward who basks in reflected glory?”

        “Such a fool,” Zeus shook his head resignedly while gathering the chaotic power within his palm. In an instant, the purple pneuma transformed into numerous tentacles that forcefully captured Pontos by his limbs and torso.

        “Let go of me!” Pontos attempted to muster his powers, struggling to break free. Yet, the tentacles dissolved and absorbed his strength, turning his resistance futile.

        “Stop wasting your powers. Lord Khaos’ power is not something you can withstand—”

        “Shut your mouth!” Pontos roared furiously. His rebellious nature refused to submit even in the face of Khaos’ superior powers, let alone tolerate the insult from Zeus, whom he deemed as weak. Regardless of the risk of being consumed by the chaotic power, Pontos unleashed all the water elements he could muster, pouring out every ounce of his strength.

        “Arghhhhh!” Following Pontos’ hoarse cries was the sound of the breaking chaotic power. The tentacles, unable to withstand Pontos’ immense powers, shattered and disappeared with a loud bang. The power’s backlash sent Zeus flying to a distance. He fell onto the ground with blood oozing from the corner of his mouth as he murmured, “No… That’s impossible… How did you break free… Ah!”

        As soon as Pontos regained freedom, he commanded the water elements to form a torrent, capturing the fallen Zeus and lifting him high into the air. The table was turned in a fleeting second.

        “See. You have Khaos’ power, but so what? You still lost. Even if you had the world’s most extraordinary weapon, an incompetent like you could never utilize its full potential,” Pontos coldly asserted, raising his right hand and clenching it tightly. The water surged and tightened around Zeus, eliciting a shrill scream from him. 

        The sight of Zeus, who had been haughty, falling into a wretched state brought Pontos a sense of pleasure. With a malicious smile, he taunted, “What a melodious scream. Well, I shall generously forgive your impudence and grant you a swift death!”

        Just as Pontos was about to deliver the final blow, several beams of starlight descended from afar, accurately severing the torrent around Zeus, who gasped eagerly for air as he fell back to the ground.

        “Pontos, that’s too reckless of you,” said Aether, the trusted aide of Khaos, furrowing her brows as she looked at Pontos.

        “Hmph! He started it!”

        “Zeus was merely following Lord Khaos’ order. What are you doing here anyway? Shouldn’t you be creating the rivers in our new realm?”

        “Tut! It’s so boring doing the same thing every day. I just wanted to take a break in the human realm.”

        “A break?” Aether sneered. “What I see is a man looking for an excuse to slack off, Pontos. Now, be a good boy and go back to do what you’re supposed to do, or I will report your actions to Lord Khaos.”

        “You—” Pontos stared at Aether resentfully only to be subdued by her imposing aura.

        Pontos, who was well aware of Aether’s powers—which were far stronger than Zeus—and her favor with Khaos, knew he could not turn the tide solely with his strength the way he had done a moment ago.

        “Fine! I’ll go back and work on those rivers and lakes!” Pontos replied begrudgingly. Ignoring Aether’s reaction, he returned to continue his mundane tasks…</p>
