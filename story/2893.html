        <h1>Gratifying Tutorship - Metatron</h1>
        <p>
                On the quiet training ground of the Keepers, a young man with a sturdy physique unleashed a fierce blow, sending his opponent—a teenage boy who charged at him recklessly—through the air. The teenage boy fell to the ground with a thud. He attempted to rise but failed due to the overpowering impact of the blow.

        The young man was the strongest Keeper of the new generation, Metatron, who had passed the Keeper trial with outstanding achievements. Due to his exceptional combat prowess, he was often deployed to various battlefronts and asked to engage in battle drills with his juniors between wars, and there he was training with his fellow juniors.

        “Is there anyone else who wishes to challenge me?” Metatron scanned the silent crowd. Everyone seemed awestruck by the stark difference in strength between Metatron and his opponent, none daring to step forward. Disappointed by their timidity, Metatron let out a soft sigh and said, “Since no one steps up, let’s call—”

        “Wait!” A resolute voice interrupted Metatron as a figure pushed through the crowd. It was a young woman with striking red hair.

        “I wish to challenge you! I am Uriel, the top trainee of the year!” the woman confidently introduced herself, her eyes blazing as she locked gazes with Metatron. Her personality clearly matched her fiery red hair—bold and passionate.

        “Come, show me what you got.” Despite Uriel’s identity as a trainee, Metatron treated her as any worthy opponent, launching a series of attacks mercilessly.

        Unsurprisingly, the battle ended in less than fifteen minutes with Uriel kneeling on the ground, defeated.

        Metatron could not help but feel discontented as he saw the dejected look on Uriel’s face, and he thought, ‘Alas, she has probably become afraid of failure, just like all the other trainees who have been defeated.”

        However, what Uriel did next surprised him: she rose to her feet, her face showing unwavering determination as she said,

        “Next time, I will defeat you!”

        Uriel’s fearless declaration did not anger Metatron; instead, it sparked a feeling of pleasurable anticipation which motivated him to become Uriel’s mentor afterward.

        Metatron felt a sense of pride and excitement as Uriel grew stronger day by day. At that time, he had yet to view Uriel as a woman but simply as a promising mentee who would become his rival in the future. It was not until the trainees’ banquet that his point of view changed.

        It was a banquet designed to get the trainees out of their uniforms and help them relax, and Metatron was invited as a guest. Watching everyone dancing in the ballroom in elegant suits and gowns, he could not help but feel out of place, so he retreated to a corner, sipping from a glass and watching quietly until a commotion at the entrance drew his attention.

        A gracefully proportioned young woman appeared in a stunning gown that set her fiery red hair ablaze. Her beauty drew a lot of attention, and soon she was surrounded by some eager suitors. However, she seemed rather uncomfortable with their flattery. Her eyes nervously scanned the room until they met Metatron’s. With a sigh of relief, she immediately made her way toward him in her wobbling high heels.

        It was then that Metatron realized the enchanting young woman was none other than his promising mentee, Uriel. The moment he became truly aware of Uriel’s femininity, his heart began to pound, faster and faster, leaving his thoughts muddled for a while.

        “Hey! Hey! Metatron! Metatron!”

        “Uh… Wh-what’s wrong?” Metatron distractedly asked as he snapped out of his daze after Uriel called him several times.

        “Why were you spacing out?” Uriel asked with a frown, but she soon knowingly said, “Oh, I got it. You must find this place unbearable too, right? I wouldn’t have come here if my instructor didn’t make me… How about we sneak out together?”

        “Su-Sure!” Metatron, still caught in his confusing thoughts, let Uriel pull him out of the banquet hall.

        As soon as they arrived at the empty training ground, Uriel kicked off her high heels and tied up her skirt hem for easier movement. She then grabbed a training weapon and pointed it at Metatron with a confident smile.

        “The training ground just feels much better. Here, let’s fight.”

        “...Okay.” Uriel’s radiant smile made it impossible for Metatron to refuse any of her requests. He compliantly picked up a training weapon and started their battle drill as usual.

        However, Metatron felt different this time. His heart involuntarily raced as he looked at Uriel’s beautiful face, and he unknowingly slowed down his attacks.

        ‘She’s a girl… I can’t use all my power on her…’

        Metatron’s hesitation gave Uriel an opportunity, allowing her to knock the weapon out of his hand and ultimately defeat him.

        Yet, Uriel felt no joy at her first victory against Metatron; she was rather filled with indignation.

        “Why? Why did you hold back? Do you not think I’m a worthy opponent?” Uriel demanded sharply of an explanation.

        “I…” As much as Metatron attempted to explain, his words stuck in his throat as he found that all of them were just a feeble excuse. Even he was shocked and puzzled by his own thoughts.

        “I’ve had enough! Today just sucks!” Uriel, fed up with Metatron’s reticence, dropped her weapon and stormed off, leaving him alone on the training ground.

        ‘I did hold back after I became aware that Uriel is a woman…’ Metatron contemplated, ‘And that was wrong. The enemies on the battlefield won’t spare her just because she is a woman. My protection and feelings for Uriel will only make her weak, and even cost her life…’

        Metatron recalled a time from his youth when he had rescued an injured bird. He protected and took care of the bird meticulously but it still died in the end. It was then he realized that his overprotection had stripped the bird of its survival instincts, and now Uriel was that bird.

        ‘I must withhold my feelings for Uriel until she is able to stand on her own. That is the right thing to do,’ Metatron inwardly decided.

        With newfound clarity, Metatron apologized to Uriel the next day. He set aside his feelings and actively guided her through training, patiently awaiting the moment when the little bird spread her wings…</p>
