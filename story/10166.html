        <h1>Sparkling Visionary - Ingrid</h1>
        <p>A witch of Kremier and a member of Charlouette the magic agency.

She married Enoch after he had liberated the power of the origin. After her marriage, she kept working in the Starmage and studying magic formulas. Eventually, she became the first mage that created a seven-layered magic formula.

Although she seems prickly and difficult to get along with, deep inside she is a soft-hearted woman who doesnâ€™t want to see others getting hurt or sad.</p>
