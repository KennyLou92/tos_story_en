        <h1>Detrimental Vedas - Brahma</h1>
        <p>Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.4

        In a remote forest on the outskirts of Sinha, a man meticulously drew a large magic circle. Each stroke of his brush left a trace of swirling black ink, forming an ominous mandala around a long casket.

        Inside the casket rested a woman of unparalleled beauty. Her eyes were tightly shut, her chest motionless; it was evident that she had fallen into an eternal slumber.

        After half a day of painstaking work, the man finally completed the mandala. He walked toward the casket, his eyes filled with tender longing as he gazed upon the woman. Excitedly, he gently stroked her cheek while taking an enigmatic pendant from his pocket.

        The pendant, no larger than the palm of a hand, was crafted from seven crystals of different colors engraved with enigmatic patterns. It pulsated with a radiant energy as if powering something.

        After placing the pendant on the woman’s chest, he spoke tenderly as if whispering to his lover, “Shata, it turns out this pendant holds the secret of Sinha’s prosperity.”

        The man, known as Brahma, was recruited as a physician for the King of Sinha, Varuna. Capitalizing on the King’s trust that he earned through his successful treatment, he requested access to the royal library, where he stumbled upon ancient texts revealing the location of the ancient tomb of Sinha. He ventured into the tomb in the middle of the night and discovered the chronicles of the foundation of Sinha.

        It turned out that a group of gods known as the Eldus gave the pendant to the people on the land, claiming that it would shield them from the ravages of the scarlet blazes and ensure their survival in this harsh world. Unfortunately, human desires proved insatiable; Varuna’s avaricious ancestors emerged victorious over other survivors. They kept the pendant to themselves, ultimately building a kingdom based on tyranny.

        “This pendant can harness the powers of creation within the protective scarlet blaze and create a barrier to the destructive blaze, and that is why the land of Sinha prospers,” Brahma mused, lifting his gaze toward the two blazes hanging in the sky. To ordinary eyes, the two blazes shared the same shade of crimson radiance. Yet, they appeared different in Brahma’s eyes as one showed a white radiance while the other gave out a black one.

        Once, Brahma, like any ordinary human, could not discern the difference between the two scarlet blazes. However, a recent near-death experience had granted him profound insight into the truth.

        Brahma had struggled to awaken his heart chakra throughout his past until he realized the reason behind his struggle in a fateful incident: he had been using the power of protection to steer his chakras when his path actually lay in destruction. The opposing nature of the two forces had kept him from attaining harmony and hindered his ability to use his seven chakras as he desired.

        Yet, in that moment of imminent demise, Brahma felt a familiar warmth, an inexplicable sense of release as the power of death, destruction, and decay—a force that belonged to the realm of negation—enveloped him; he felt as if he had returned to his mother’s womb. It was in that instant that Brahma understood his true purpose: to bring about the destruction of this withering world so that it could be reborn. 

        Driven by this newfound revelation, Brahma actively sought ways to bring about the world’s annihilation, and eventually, he got the answers within the ancient tomb of Sinha.

        “As soon as I reverse the power of this pendant, I can gather the destructive force within Sinha. Then, using both you and myself as sacrifices, we can connect with the destructive blaze and amplify its power. And then, it will consume the protective blaze and…”

        Brahma paused and clapped his hands like an exuberant child, his smile genuine and radiant.

        “...We will destroy this world filled with despair and sorrows. Everyone will return to the origin and await the world’s rebirth… Oh, it truly is the most beautiful sight...” Brahma murmured, closing his eyes as he envisioned that wondrous future. He then unsheathed a dagger. With the sharp blade in his hands, he declared with solemnity, “Shata, I shall begin the ritual. First, I must activate the reverse magic with my heart as a sacrifice.”

        When Brahma prepared to plunge the dagger into his chest, a powerful blast of prana came from a distance. He had no choice but to pause the ritual and swiftly evade the attack by leaping backward.

        Brahma looked toward the assailant. His face involuntarily darkened upon seeing a sturdy figure. He said with annoyance, “Vishnu, it’s you again.”

        “Yes, it’s me. Brahma, I’ve come to stop you!” Vishnu said. His face filled with sorrow as he saw Shatarupa lying in the casket, “You have truly changed. I can’t believe you even killed Shatarupa.”

        “Heh, Vishnu, you know nothing at all. You can’t even grasp the truth of this world. How are you going to stop me?” Brahma, now understanding his true nature, no longer suppressed himself. He abandoned his facade as a virtuous man, showing his true colors—a rebellious, arrogant, and ruthless man who proudly declared, “Everything I do is to save this world.”

        “So, amplifying the destructive blaze to annihilate everything is your method of saving the world?!”

        “How… How do you know?”Brahma was surprised but he soon figured it out, “So you met the conjoined twins.”

        “So you’ve decided to inflict suffering upon others to fulfill your own desires… Guru Indra would undoubtedly be deeply pained by what you’re doing,” Vishnu remarked.

        “No, Guru Indra would surely understand me,” Brahma said confidently, “Sacrifices must be made for glorious purposes. This is the path we must tread to save all beings!”

        “Nonsense!” Vishnu firmly refuted, “Destruction is destruction, nothing more or less.  It cannot give birth to life, nor can it bring happiness to humanity. Only the power of protection can save the world!”

        “It seems we can never understand each other,” Brahma lamented, shaking his head with regret. A sharp gleam flickered across his eyes as he said, “Then let fate decide who the true victor is!”

        Brahma unleashed his power. His body turned translucent as his dark prana coursed through his veins. Taking a forceful step forward, he launched an open-hand strike toward Vishnu.

        Vishnu extended his palm to meet the attack while summoning the power of protection within him. His chakras spun rapidly, emanating dazzling white radiance that coalesced into resplendent blossoms throughout his translucent skin.

        The world fell silent as their palms clashed; time seemed to freeze at that moment. Only the polarized energies within their bodies continued to exchange attacks, targeting each other’s vital points.

        Initially, the black and white forces were evenly matched. However, the white light gradually weakened as time passed, eventually consumed by the dark force.

        “Darn it…” Vishnu, knowing his imminent defeat, uttered words of regret and frustration.

        Brahma could not help but reveal a victorious smile upon seeing Vishnu’s defeated expression.  He unleashed another surge of dark power that flooded toward Vishnu like a tidal wave. Finally, Vishnu succumbed and collapsed in defeat. The rampage of dark power within him created numerous cracks in his skin. It seemed his time was running out. 

        “It seems fate has chosen me,” Brahma said jubilantly, “Vishnu, just stay there and witness the world’s destruction.”

        Paying no further attention to Vishnu, Brahma walked back to the casket. With swift precision, he cut open his chest with the dagger. His blood poured on Shatarupa’s body as well as the pendant, drenching them in deep crimson.

        As his blood flowed onto the magic circle on the ground, the power within it was activated. A powerful beam of blackish-red light shot up into the sky, connecting with one of the scarlet blazes. The blaze began to expand, as if infused with renewed energy, and quickly began to eclipse the other blaze.

        “Oh… Yes, this is what I envisioned,” Brahma, whose face had turned deadly pale due to excessive blood loss, somehow remained energized, resembling a man who got his final surge of energy before his demise. With fervent obsession, he gazed at the steadily growing blaze and whispered, “Yes… Swallow everything, take in all the despair, sorrow, envy, and hatred… Devour everyone’s sufferings and destroy them. Only through destruction can the world be reborn and we be free from the cycle of calamity.”

        The destructive blaze continued to grow, and Brahma, as the closest one to the blaze, was the first to be consumed. His body began to crumble under the influence of the dark force, his limbs turning into dust and dissipating into the air. Yet, he remained fearless. With outstretched limbs and a serene smile, he embraced his death.

        “Brahma, you’ve finally come to me. Only through this union can we become one and stay together until eternity…” a familiar female voice resounded within the remnants of Brahma’s consciousness which was soon completely engulfed by the scarlet blaze in a resplendent burst of crimson light. Finally, he became a part of the destructive blaze as his mind sank within the vortex of chaotic forces…</p>
