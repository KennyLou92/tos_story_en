        <h1>Congenital Defect - Atlach</h1>
        <p>Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.4

        In a corner of the boundless cosmos, a cavernous structure fashioned from countless headless masses of flesh floated, resembling a hive. Through a labyrinthine passage, it arrived at the remains of a dead planet where a massive contraption similar to a spinning wheel stood.

        The contraption had two upward-pointing spindles that pierced through the torsos of two wretched beings whose bodies had been reduced to mere husks. From the lower halves of their mutilated forms, strands of fibers, shimmering with golden and silver radiance, extended towards the apparatus in the middle, which spun them into one resilient and sparkling thread of intertwined colors.

        The headless mass of flesh grasped the handle of the spinning apparatus. With a sinister chuckle, it turned the handle, setting the previously dormant contraption back into motion to extract every ounce of powers and souls from the tormented beings.

        “ARGHHHHH—!”

        Agonizing cries were squeezed out of the two barely living creatures, imbuing the silent celestial husk with a savage and harrowing ambiance. However, their horrifying screams soon faded away for their wills had been thoroughly broken. Their contorted bodies trembled ever so slightly, unable to retain a recognizable form.

        Impaled by the right spindle, Atlach turned its twisted form—resembling that of a spider—to the left. Enduring the excruciating pain, it opened its eyes to gaze upon its deformed and frail brother, Ghatanothoa. Hot tears welled up in its empty sockets but were still unable to conceal the gnawing sense of guilt within it.

        “Ghata… My brother… It’s all my fault… It’s all because of me that you have to suffer this torment…” Atlach berated itself relentlessly, its psyche consumed by regret.

        Not long ago, Atlach rescued Ghatanothoa, who had been gravely injured by Daoloth. It exerted all of its remaining powers to heal the shattered soul of its dearest brother, which yet plagued it with a surging desire for destruction that threatened to consume it. Atlach resorted to self-condemnation to suppress its maddening mind, fearing that it would harm its beloved brother, Ghatanothoa.

        Unfortunately, Atlach’s act of healing Ghatanothoa, coupled with its self-inflicted injuries, had emptied all its powers and drained it completely so it ran from Ghatanothoa as far away as possible before falling into a coma. Unexpectedly, it found itself saved by Y’golonac, a follower of destruction, upon awakening.

        Little did Atlach know, it was all a trap.

        Y’golonac, driven by the desire to disrupt the balance between Azathoth and Daoloth, allied itself with Mordiggian, an inferior by-product of Daoloth’s creation. They schemed to capture Atlach and Ghatanothoa, abducting them to a secluded corner of the universe—Y’golonac’s lair.

        Stripped of their limbs and quadrupeds, Atlach and Ghatanothoa were mounted upon the spindles on the sides of the spinning wheel, becoming the thread spools of this contraption of causality that twisted their powers, wills, and even their souls, spinning them down to form a thread of fate that could bind all things and change fate.

        After an eternity had passed, the spindle at the center of the spinning wheel was finally full of sparkling threads. Meanwhile, Atlach and Ghatanothoa, the very material for the threads, remained motionless. One would assume they were already lifeless if it were not for the occasional tremor in their mutilated forms.

        Y’golonac raised the spindle high. Basking in the radiant starlight, the ethereal threads looked like nothing it had ever seen in this world. With a hint of awe in its voice, it exclaimed, “This is surely the thread of causality. We only got such a small amount of it despite exploiting most of these two’s lives and souls. We must be cautious in its use.”

        Y’golonac handed the threads of causality to Mordiggian, who then looked up at the brothers still impaled by the spindles. It inquired, “What should we do with them? Should we kill them?”

        “No, keep them. They might prove useful if some unexpected circumstances arise,” Y’golonac replied. The mouth in the palm of its hand widened and teased with disdain, “Besides, they can’t accomplish much in their current state.”

        After a moment of hesitation, Mordiggian nodded and left the lair with Y’golonac.

        “Finally, they’re gone… It’s time,” Atlach murmured, lifting its eyelids to observe the receding figures of Mordiggian and Y’golonac.

        In order to confront Azathoth, Y’golonac had gathered half of its clones within the lair, merging them to form a formidable entity, while the remaining clones stood guard over its nest.

        It was the opportunity Atlach had been waiting for.

        “I will save you, even if it shatters my soul to pieces. I will save you!” As Atlach gazed at the unconscious Ghatanothoa on the other side, its obsidian eyes glistened with a maddening determination.

        Mustering the last remnants of its power, Atlach forced the venom within its body to the surface to erode the spindles that impaled it into decrepit ruins. Although the venom also gnawed at Atlach’s own damaged form, it remained undeterred. With its ruptured body, Atlach maneuvered towards Ghatanothoa, carefully guiding the venom to corrupt the other spindle while avoiding any harm to its beloved brother.

        Finally, Atlach’s efforts bore fruit as Ghatanothoa slipped free from the spindle. In that moment of descent, Atlach positioned its body to cushion Ghatanothoa’s fall and shield its brother with its own tattered form.

        “Why does such beauty exist in this filthy, grotesque world?” Overwhelmed by the familiar touch, Atlach burst into tears, finding the wounds it endured insignificant in that instant.

        Yet, its anxiety quickly resurfaced as it sensed Ghatanothoa’s fragmented soul and consciousness slowly dissipating. The successive soul-shattering torment had rendered Ghatanothoa even more fragile than before, putting it to the brink of annihilation if no one filled the void within its soul soon.

        However, in this desolate cosmos, Atlach, whose soul bore deep wounds, was the only soul capable of offering itself to heal Ghatanothoa. Only by merging its shattered soul into Ghatanothoa’s being could Atlach cure its brother. Yet, the fusion of their souls also meant Atlach had to forsake its own darkness.

        Though it was a fundamental transformation, Atlach made the choice without hesitation. With tenderness and indulgence, it gently rubbed its head against Ghatanothoa’s face.

        “Ghata, if saving you means I have to embrace the goodness in life and have my spirit cleansed, then I shall willingly cast aside my darkness,” Atlach whispered, closing its eyes to let its soul sink. Without a second thought, it dove into Ghatanothoa’s consciousness, filling the ravaged soul with its own.

        “With my flawed self merging into your innocence, I can now become a part of the grace, the existence you have always pursued and loved.”

        Atlach’s consciousness gradually faded into nothingness. In its final moments, its soul erupted with the most resplendent radiance it had ever possessed.

        “Ghatanothoa, it has been my utmost bliss to be your brother and the solace of your soul.”

        After leaving those words, Atlach’s soul dissolved completely into the vast ocean of Ghatanothoa’s mind. It was at that moment that it finally bid farewell to the regrets that had entwined its entire existence and embraced the happiness bestowed upon its soul…</p>
