        <h1>Whirling Rigpa - Parvati</h1>
        <p>Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.1

        Parvati left Rahmin in search of her fellow senior apprentices, Brahma and Shatarupa. During her search, unexpectedly, she bumped into Shiva, who was being pursued by some Sinha soldiers. In the face of adversity, Shiva unleashed the power of his seven chakras and defeated all their pursuers, yet at the same time, the overexertion of chakras plunged Shiva’s mind into turmoil.

        Listening to the voice of conscience, Parvati took Shiva with her and tried to restore his sanity with her prana while continuing her quest to find her fellow apprentices. Finally, in a fortuitous moment, Shiva regained his sanity and found himself falling in love with Parvati after witnessing her unwavering support.

        Later, Parvati received a message from her former second senior, Vishnu, and met him at his residence. There, she learned the shocking news that her eldest senior apprentice, Brahma, intended to help Varuna, the ruthless tyrant of Sinha.

        Determined to uncover the truth, Parvati sneaked into the palace only to be drugged by Varuni, her senior apprentice. Just as she was about to fall into Varuni’s clutches, Shiva came to her rescue. Deeply moved by his chivalrous act and respect, Parvati mustered the courage to confess her feelings to him.

        However, their blissful moments did not last long as Parvati suddenly sensed an overwhelmingly searing pain and collapsed to the ground a few days later. Shiva, alarmed by her condition, hurriedly went to her side and supported her.

        “Are you alright? Is it the side effect of the drug?” Shiva nervously asked.

        “I… I’m fine,” Parvati said, standing up with Shiva’s help. It took her a moment to catch her breath and regain her composure. However, her expression remained grave. “Someone killed my servant, Garuda, whom I had sent to search for my senior apprentices. He told me his last location before he died. It must hold a clue to my seniors’ whereabouts. I must go and find out the truth.”

        “I’ll go with you,” Shiva insisted.

        “But there may be danger,” Parvati said.

        “That’s exactly why I’m going with you,” Shiva said determinedly, looking deeply into her eyes, “I don’t want you to get hurt.”

        “Shiva…” Parvati’s heart fluttered at Shiva’s words. Putting her arms around Shiva, she softly whispered in an affectionate voice, “Okay, let’s go together.” 

        And so, the two set off to the location—a remote ancient tomb in Sinha. After exchanging a glance, they simultaneously channeled their prana to open their chakras. With their body becoming incredibly light, they entered the tomb and walked to the very end, hand in hand.
 
        At the end of the tomb, they saw multiple heavy chains hanging from the ceiling. The floor beneath them bore traces of a pattern that had been wiped away. However, what truly struck them with horror were the cages placed in the corner, each imprisoning a creature that defied human form, with limbs in twisted shapes or grotesque tumors protruding from their bodies, a horrific sight that instilled fear in any who beheld them.

        “What are these creatures?” Parvati asked, unable to contain her curiosity.

        “I don’t know, but I do notice something… Their bodies are filled with shadows,” Shiva hesitated in his response. Parvati then used her chakra vision to peer into their bodies and found the murky power within them, which was the cause of their twisted forms.

        “Could this have something to do with my senior apprentices…? What are they planning to do?” While Parvati pondered anxiously, she caught a glimpse of a flickering red light in a corner of the room.

        “That’s Garuda’s heart!” Parvati hurriedly walked to the red glow and stooped to pick up the crimson gem. Yet, her action only caused Shiva to frown with alarm.

        ‘That gem is strange!’ Shiva, who instinctively sensed the danger, rushed over to snatch the gem from Parvati’s hand.

        “What are you doing— Ah!” Parvati’s question was abruptly halted by the burst of blinding light emanating from the gem. Then, a string of Sanskrit inscriptions spilled from the gem and formed a sturdy shackle that swiftly bound Shiva’s body.

        “Shiva!” Parvati exclaimed in shock. She reached out to remove the shackle, only to find it unbudgeable. “Dang it! Why can’t I remove it?”

        “That’s because it’s a Sanskrit spell crafted by our esteemed physician,” a male voice responded to Parvati from a distance. Alert, she quickly turned around and looked at the dim empty space, questioning angrily, “Who is it?”

        “Me?” Footsteps resounded as a man walked out of the shadows. With a cheerful smile, he introduced himself, “I’m Kubera, a merchant.”

        “A merchant? Heh!” Parvati sneered, “You’re telling me that a mere merchant created all of these?”

        “Hey, hey, I didn’t create them. The esteemed physician, Brahma, made them, and I’m just an employee of his,” Kubera replied. 

        “Brahma?” Parvati exclaimed in disbelief, her expression turning grim as she asked, “What did he employ you for?”

        “He hired me to keep his secret safe and eliminate those nosy individuals, for example, you,” Kubera replied.

        “You eliminating me?” Parvati looked at Kubera disdainfully, fully aware that he had no understanding of the principles of chakras and was thus no match for her.

        “Of course not. I’m just a mere merchant, remember? He will be your opponent,” Kubera said. As soon as he snapped his fingers, heavy footsteps resounded.

        A figure several times larger than Kubera appeared beside him. It was a man with a hideous face so terribly swollen that all of his features had gone beyond recognition. Only his large mouth—filled with sharp teeth, some stained traces of crimson—remained recognizable.

        Raising his sturdy right arm, with a fierce push of his legs, he lunged toward Parvati like a flying arrow, giving Parvati only a little time to strengthen her body with her prana in defense. However, even with the power of chakras, Parvati failed to withstand the overpowering attack that sent her flying. Her body fell into the rubble after leaving a deep hole in the wall.

        “Parvati!” No matter how Shiva desperately struggled to break free from the shackle, his effort proved to be futile, so he could only shout anxiously, “Parvati!”

        “Cough… cough…” Parvati laboriously rose from the debris. Yet, blood trickled from her mouth as her injuries were aggravated because of her movements. Still, she refused to fall; she braced herself and wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth. With a burning and indomitable will in her eyes, she responded to Shiva, “I’m fine.”

        Kubera nonchalantly whistled as he eyed Parvati with an admiring gaze. “I’ve never seen such a formidable woman. I like you. Why don’t you come with me instead? Then I’ll spare your life.”

        “No, I’m already in love with someone, someone who’s taught me how to perceive the world,” Parvati proudly said, giving Shiva a meaningful look. Shiva, who understood her plan, returned the look with a trusting gaze. Then, he watched as she lifted her right leg, balancing her body on the tip of her left foot while extending her left arm vertically, forming a pose that carried elegance and strength like a majestic crane.

        Peculiar as Parvati’s pose, Kubera could not shake off the sudden fright that crept up on him. He quickly snapped his fingers and issued a command to the colossal man who was actually a product of some experimentation, “Take her down!”

        “ROAR!” The man let out a roar and once again leaped into the air, swooping down on Parvati. However, Parvati remained unflustered. With undivided attention, she reflected on her connection with the world, completely immersed in the spiritual realm where time seemed to be unimaginably slow. As all her seven chakras were liberated between her movements, power coursed through her entire being and eventually reached her very soul.

        ‘Oh… So this is the karma of all things,’ Parvati sighed in awe at the wondrous realm before her. Amidst the vibrant and ever-changing colors, she slowly extended a finger and placed it precisely on the man’s chest. Magically, the man froze in mid-air, as if held by an unknown force. Then, she opened her eyes, and within her irises bloomed a radiant lotus that continued to spin.

        “Return, and transcend the boundless suffering as I shall give you the liberation of eternal rest,” Parvati said with layers of radiance emanating from her fingertip. As the light flowed into the man’s body, a smile spread across his face as if his wish had been satisfied before his body withered away and turned into ashes, ultimately dispersing in the air.

        “Are you still going to fight?” Parvati calmly asked Kubera, who had been astonished by what had happened before him. It took him a moment to regain his composure and raise his hands in surrender, “No, as an ordinary merchant, I’m not interested in doing an unprofitable business, especially one that would cost my life.”

        Afterward, at Parvati’s request, Kubera released the shackle on Shiva, who immediately knocked him unconscious with a punch. He then ran to Parvati’s side and asked with evident concern in his voice, “Are you alright?”

        “I— Hmm!” A wave of dizziness washed over Parvati and cut her words short. Luckily, Shiva caught her in time and stopped her from falling to the ground.

        “You must have exhausted your strength from using your chakras just now. You need rest!” Shiva said.

        “No… It isn’t safe here. We need to leave as soon as possible,” Parvati insisted.

        “But you…” Seeing Parvati struggling to maintain her balance, Shiva gritted his teeth as he made up his mind. He squatted in front of her and said, “Hop on! I’ll carry you!”

        Shiva’s offer brought a flush to Parvati’s cheeks. She hesitated for a moment before she climbed onto Shiva’s back, considering her physical condition. Still, she could not help but feel shy. To conceal her embarrassment, she buried her face in Shiva’s shoulder. His body was so warm that it also warmed her heart.

        “I wish to be with him forever, no matter what happens.”</p>
