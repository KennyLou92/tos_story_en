        <p>
        Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.5

        “Azathoth… Azathoth… Azathoth…”

        In the vast expanse of cosmos, a colossal rust-red spherical creature traversed the celestial bodies with incredible speed. It was Ghroth, who was heading toward a certain corner of the universe. 

        Not long ago, Ghroth, who had been evicted back to the realm of dreams by Azathoth, returned to the actual world with the help of Y’golonac. Upon regaining its freedom, Ghroth devoured Y’golonac in a fit of rage that had accumulated through its imprisonment without listening to the latter’s words. It then set out to find Azathoth.

        In its quest, Ghroth delved into the remains of Y’golonac and scoured through its memories, only to discover an eldritch truth that shattered its sanity—Azathoth had united with Daoloth.

        As reluctant as Ghroth was to accept the grim reality, Ghroth was forced to face the truth by the visions it had stolen from various creatures’ dreams. Consumed by boundless jealousy, Ghroth sought to crush Daoloth’s consciousness in the realm of dreams. Yet, its efforts were proved to be in vain as Azathoth discovered its intentions. With its own hands, Azathoth torn asunder Ghroth’s clone, expelling it from Daoloth’s dream.

        Provoked by Azathoth’s rejection, Ghroth resolved to wipe out all beings until only Azathoth and itself were left in the world where they would live entwined for eternity.

        After relentless searching, Ghroth finally tracked down Azathoth’s whereabouts. Soaring from one planet to another, it eventually arrived at a secluded corner of the universe where the once pristine galaxy bore the scars of a cataclysmic battle, as if a colossal hand had torn it apart, leaving countless cracks and wormholes in its wake.

        While another species might be intrigued by the enigma of what had transpired, Ghroth remained apathetic, for its focus lay solely on the distorted creature that had occupied half the universe. Despite the creature’s dissimilar form to a dragon, Ghroth still recognized that it was Azathoth instantly.

        At that point, Azathoth appeared more deranged than ever before with the foulest curses leaking from every inch of its body. It continued to destroy itself while  simultaneously conjuring new flesh. Even a mere gaze from Azathoth shook Ghroth’s sanity for a fleeting moment.

        However, as the dream gobbler, Ghroth possessed an ethereal will, even though its power had diminished upon crossing into the mortal world. It swiftly regained its composure and sensed a shadowy figure stealthily approaching Azathoth, holding something that gleamed with a golden and silver radiance in its mouth. Despite the distance between them, Ghroth could still perceive the potency of that object and realized the stranger’s intent to harm Azathoth.

        While Azathoth remained oblivious in the depths of madness, Ghroth had zero tolerance for anyone who wanted to harm its beloved Azathoth. Thus, it took action—as its plump vessel jolted, a fissure opened beneath its eye, like flowers blooming in profusion. Its powers coalesced into a beam of stardust that hurtled toward the shadowy figure.

        Sensing the imminent danger, the shadow swiftly evaded Ghroth’s attack. Still, it failed to elude Ghroth’s interception, forced to reveal its true visage as the other’s colossal eyes drew close to it—it was a reptilian creature with numerous arms and orifices.

        “You despicable scum…haha…dare to hurt Azathoth… Unforgivable! Boohoo.”

        “The lord of dreams, we meet again.” the creature replied calmly, devoid of fear. Its words momentarily quelled the anger of Ghroth, who took a step back to scrutinize it from head to toe. An understanding gleam flickered across Ghroth’s eyes.

        “You’re, the inferior by-product of Daoloth’s creation, haha, Mordiggian.”

        “Yes, but you’re wrong. I’m Mordiggian, but I’m no longer an inferior being,” Mordiggian answered proudly. Mordiggian was an inferior by-product of Daoloth’s creation of Tarones. Yet, an accidental glimpse of Daoloth’s true form sparked an intense sense of self within it and an ambition to rise to Daoloth’s status. For that purpose, it did not hesitate to consume the remnants of Arwassa, a follower of creation, to be rid of its inferior soul.

        Later, Mordiggian hunted and murdered Y’golonac when it arrived on the Tarones. After assimilating Y’golonac, Mordiggian learned of its deepest desires and decided to conspire with each other, plotting to disrupt the universe’s fate. Together they captured Atlach and Ghatanothoa, the siblings born of the same celestial essence, and made them the raw material for making the thread of causality, seeking to seize Azathoth’s powers, its existence, and even its fate.

        Unfortunately, their scheme was thwarted by Yibb, who severely wounded Mordiggian. Y’golonac fled as soon as its partner’s failure.Yet, it became mentally disoriented upon the obliteration of its other clones, which left it unguarded and vulnerable.

        Seizing the opportunity, the barely breathing Mordiggian slithered toward Y’golonac and devoured it to mend its damaged form with its partner’s powers. The consecutive consumption of transcendent beings led to another sublimation of Mordiggian’s soul, enhancing its resilience. With its essence becoming close to that of Ghroth and its kind, it no longer resembled the ignorant and inferior being it once was. Instead, it bravely faced the intimidating existence it once revered.

        “I haven’t thanked you for the guidance you gave me. It was your teachings that led me onto the path of evolution, allowing me to grow into the superior being I am now. Soon, very soon, I shall replace Azathoth.”

        “No… Haha…even if you’ve grown, you still can’t change your nature…boohoo, your fate.”

        “That’s why I’m changing my fate, my existence, with the thread of causality,” said Mordiggian, raising the spindle entangled in gold and silver, the remnants of the thread of causality it found upon consuming Y’golonac, which would be enough to bind Azathoth once again. 
　　
        “No… No…Boohoo… You shall not harm Azathoth…Haha… No one should ever harm Azathoth!” Ghroth could no longer contain its fury. It viciously opened its maw, revealing rows of razor-sharp teeth, and lunged towards Mordiggian—

        Pfft!

        Mordiggian swiftly split itself into countless clones, much like Y’golonac when it was swallowed, before Ghroth could sink its teeth into its body. Each clone then underwent its own evolution and transformation, some growing segmented limbs with piercing spikes while others sprouting agile beast-like legs or developing enormous mouths filled with tiny teeth... All of them bore the characteristics of the species Mordiggian had devoured.

        The clones of Mordiggian launched a spate of attacks upon Ghroth. Their appendages tearing through its rusty-red skin, causing thick, vile fluids to ooze; their agile legs punctured countless wounds in Ghroth’s flesh, leaving countless gashes. Their mouths savored the tender flesh, inflicting excruciating pain upon Ghroth.

        Moments passed, and Ghroth was riddled with wounds. Although it attempted to fight back, but all its efforts were in vain after Mordiggian unraveled them effortlessly. Finally, Ghroth was left with nothing but gasping respiration.

        “Humph, it is even weaker than Yibb. The lord of dreams is no intimidation after all.” Mordiggian sneered, disdainfully casting its gaze upon Ghroth. Summoning its myriad of clones to reunite as one, it raised one of its sharp appendages to give Ghroth its final blow. However, it noticed something dripping onto its face.

        “What… I… am melting?” Mordiggian lifted its gaze toward its appendage, only to find that it was eerily dissolving, transforming into viscous droplets that fell onto its face. As the rest of its body followed suit, it was as if a revelation had dawned upon it.

        “This is the karmic reaction when an inferior soul absorbs powers that are beyond its capacity,” said Arwassa, the creator of joy, emotionless as it looked down upon the disintegrating Mordiggian. The two beings—Atlach and Ghatanothoa—standing by its side chimed in one after another.

        “An inferior creation can never alter its nature and will no matter how many transcendent beings it devours. You can never replace Azathoth.”

        “Your soul denies yourself. Your conflicting thoughts are what ultimately render your physical form. Now, wither and die.”

        “No… No! NO! ARGHHHHHHH—!” Mordiggian let out a wretched scream. Its agony echoed from the realm of nightmares to the mortal world, amusing Ghroth, who remained unscathed.

        In the moment when the countless clones of Mordiggian lunged forward after their split, Ghroth summoned its power, causing myriad eyes to sprout all over its body. Each eye locked onto a fragmented clone, plunging them all into dreams in an instant, All the clones became ensnared within a malicious nightmare designed by the lord of dreams.

        “Haha… Inferior species… Your soul shall forever be imprisoned in nightmares… wither… boohoo… And perish…”

        “ROARRRR—!” A universe-shaking roar interrupted Ghroth’s mockery, urging it to turn and gaze toward the source—

        It was Azathoth, whose soul was still in boundless agony. Although Yibb had successfully destroyed the wellspring of powers that deviated from the thread of causality, the clash of two high-dimensional powers continued to torment Azathoth, consuming its soul and will.

        “Azathoth… Boohoo… I’m here for you… I will end your suffering, haha.” Ghroth, unable to bear witness to Azathoth’s pain, approached it without hesitation. However, the tumult of the high-dimensional forces had stripped away Azathoth’s sanity.

        With its widened crimson eyes, Azathoth glared furiously at the approaching Ghroth, unleashing the most venomous curses, “Damn you! Die, die, die, DIE! AHHHHHH—!”

        “Haha, Azathoth is giving me death… Woo… I’m so happy.”

        It was the first time Azathoth had laid its gaze solely on Ghroth. Enthralled by this rare privilege, Ghroth obediently closed its eyes, gladly embracing the death bestowed upon it by its beloved...</p>
