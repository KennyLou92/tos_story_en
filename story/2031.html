        <h1>Philosophy of Empiricism - Bacon</h1>
        <p>
                Knock—knock—

        An old man Bacon knocked the floor with a crutch, giving a tempo of unique rhythm.  In a good mood, he was walking slowly to a high-ceilinged place.

        Boyle carried Newton over; Darwin was still faint, lying right beside him.  “How is it,” asked Bacon.

        “I brought Newton back.”

        “Well done, Boyle.  Plato also got his job done.  I know I can always count on you two,” Bacon was satisfied.  “Bring them downstairs.”

        Boyle then moved them to the spiral.  Underneath the staircase, there was a beautiful garden.  However, the ambience lingering over the view was not right——Two men and a lady were subdued.  The lady seemed to be knocked out.  “Oh, cocky kid was caught too,” the younger man mocked as he saw Newton.

        “That’s the annoying guy in the briefing session…” Having slightly recovered from palsy, Newton looked down and recalled.

        Newton was invited by Lomond Manor to be a researcher.  The first day on duty was ambushed by someone and brought to this place.  He managed to escape with a gold scientist named Darwin.  As both of them arrived at the spiral staircase, they were defeated by Boyle and ended up like the “victims” here.

        The young man was Edison, a new researcher too.  Similar to Newton’s situation, Edison got beaten by Plato when he barely found the way out, ending up trapped here.

        Newton withstood the palsy and asked Bacon, “Who are you?  Why brought us here?”

        “It’s all for the mankind, to extend the lifespan of humanity.” Bacon gazed into the distance in deep sorrow.  “Gods abandoned us, and humanity is threatened by demons.   Only by seeking new possibilities, humans could change their fate.”

        Despite the sincerity in Bacon’s word, Newton was even more pissed.  “So does it have something to do with us!?  I don’t care about your bullcrap!  Release us,” he raised his volume.

        “Okay, make your choice.” Bacon touched his beard and continued, “if you want to set them free, then kill him.”

        “What...did you say?”

        “Well, weren’t you listening?  Kill one.  Save three. Isn’t it worthy?”

        “Stop...kidding!” Newton was red with rage and roared, “life is not mathematics.  You can’t manipulate it at will!”

        “Oh, I know.  It is the so-called moral thing right?  But for true researcher, this should be abandoned, because it will only hinder us from exploring knowledge and seeking truth.”

        “Haha!  What a self-complacent old man!  Sacrifice to achieve your target?  It’s just because you’re too weak.” Edison cut in with a sarcastic tone after listening to what they said.

        Then, Plato put a dagger close to his neck; Edison did not intend to restrain himself, but burst into laughter instead.  “Oh, seems I hit the nail!  You should look at your angry face.”

        The dagger slightly scratched his skin, leaving a drop of blood.  Nervousness made Newton’s pupils contract.  Luckily, the dagger did not go deeper, which made him feel relieve.

        “It’s alright if you don’t choose.  Then I’ll kill everyone here, including you.” Bacon kicked a knife towards Newton, and placed his hands on the crutch.  “Those who can’t get rid of their guilty conscience will never be a successful scientist.”

        “I…” Newton bit his lips as he looked at the glittering knife.

        “Ha!” Edison sneered.  “I guess counting on the candy rain is even more reliable than this naive kid.”

        “You…” Newton looked at Edison as if he understood something.  He reached into the pocket of his coat and spoke after a short pause.  “You’re gonna die young if you keep being mean even at this critical moment.”

        “Back at you.” Edison closed his eyes and smiled, enjoying the bicker between them.

        “Alright, time to choose,” Bacon said.

        Newton hesitated for a while.  He picked up the knife, took every heavy step towards the faint Darwin and raised it.  Just when Bacon thought he would do it, Newton turned around.

        The sole of his shoes created a sharp voice due to the rapid friction with the floor.  The moment when he swung the sword, he changed his direction suddenly, running to the stairs.  Newton took out something from his pocket and threw it out!

        “Catch,” shouted Newton.

        A round candy fell above Edison.  In the nick of time, he elbowed Plato in the face and seized this chance to sprint instantly.  In a split second, Edison summoned light element and cast a fist-size sphere over the falling candy.

        During their first encounter, Edison coincidently put a candy into Newton’s pocket in the face-off.  Edison had never expected this would become his life savior.

        In a flash, the candy was blown up into dust by light element, scattering in the air as dazzling as the twinkle of stars.

        “Kid, light it up!”

        “Tut!  I’m not a kid!” Newton dodged Boyle’s attack with a flip.  At the same time, he gathered fire element into his palm and soon turned into a blazing fireball.

        Newton, leaping backwards, threw out the fireball at the dust——

        Bomb!  The charged dust, heated with fire, created an incredible explosion.  Momentarily, the entire place was shrouded in smoke.

        “Unbelievable...They exploded the dust with fire. He could’ve got himself killed if it wasn’t careful enough...Humph!  This is interesting.”

        Bacon showed no fear in the smoke, but felt excited somehow.  All of a sudden, he sensed an unorthodox air current on the right side.  Then, he raised his crutch to parry Edison’s attack skillfully.

        “Tut!  What a fast old man.” As the sneak attack failed, Edison backed up immediately.  Bacon, who remained composed, had no intention to strike back.  “Why bother to attack an old man but leave your fellows in danger.  Is it a miscalculation?”

        “To catch bandits, you must first catch the ringleader.” Newton showed himself in the smoke and got his sword back.

        “Saving injured fellows will only drag him down, and save the time to take me as a hostage in exchange for a bargain.  Nice analytical skill.” Bacon observed and reviewed their actions with disdain.

        “Your attitude really pisses me off.  Usually I’m respectful to the old.  But you’re an exception!” Edison raised his dagger again.  “Let’s go, kid!”

        “I’ve told you my name was Newton!” he refuted.  Both of them charged at Bacon with their weapons——

        Two flashes of lightfrom afar hit both Edison’s and Newton’s hands precisely, disarming the two of them.

        “Is this...a marble?” Edison took a closer look; and someone showed up in the smoke——Einstein.

        Newton stared, “you’re the new researcher...Are you with them?”

        “You still haven’t figured it out?  I just helped you cheat in this test.”  Einstein shook his head and continued, “You’re gonna fail if you still don’t figure the situation out.”

        “Fail?” Newton and Edison were stupefied about Einstein’s words.  Then both of them soon got it and turned around——Darwin got up in great spirits suddenly and greeted, “hi, Newton boy.”

        “You...and Marie, so we’ve been deceived all this time…” Edison looked at Marie and 
Socrates.

        “Don’t look at me like that.  I know nothing about this.” Marie bit her lips and turned away.

        “It has nothing to do with her.  I’ve been hiding the truth from Marie,” Socrates defended for her.

        Heaving a sigh of relief, Edison still hardly accepted the truth.  “So, that’s it?  After all these things, just because of this?”

        “Yes.” Einstein made a grimace.  “It’s just a test, a strength test for all newcomers here.”
