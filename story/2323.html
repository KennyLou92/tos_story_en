        <h1>Spinning Flame Dance - Furla</h1>
        <p>At noon, Furla the female elf stood outside a circus tent peeking sneakily.

“Wheeze...It’s about time,” said Furla. Adjusting her breathing pace, she frowned and ran inside where a group of dancer elves gathered.

“I-I’m sorry...When I was on the way...an old lady dragged me to point her way!”

“Furla, you overslept, didn’t you?” The coach apparently didn’t buy her saying.

“Aw, coach. I didn’t,” Furla said in pout, avoiding eye contact with the coach.

“Sigh...You skipped another practice again. It won’t do you any good even though you’re a talented dancer.” Heaving a sigh, the coach continued on the lecture when she saw the comfortable look on Furla, “tonight is the showtime. Just get yourself together as a lead dancer, Furla.”

“I can dance well without practice. It’s not the first show anyway,” Furla whined inside. Putting the costume on, she slammed the wardrobe door and slowly walked towards the others.

Furla and the elves moved their bodies along the rhythm, swinging between rings. They illustrated tales of the realm with their dance.

“Whoa!”

Furla bumped into another elf, knocking both of them down.

“Furla, did you miss the beats?” The coach asked. 

“It’s them who danced too fast,” Furla complained.

Before the coach had said anything, Furla pointed at her shoes and spoke with a pitiful face, “and this shoes is way too tight for me. How could I focus on dancing when my feet were hurt!"

“How dare you say something like that!” The knocked-down elf was unable to hold back her discontentment.

“You!”

Before Furla could say something to defend herself, the coach shouted, “shut up! This performance can’t afford any mistakes. And you, Furla, take this seriously! Don’t try to muddle along every show.”

The elves returned to their positions after getting scolded by the coach. Later on, the showcase was about to start. Furla and the rest dance with the music again. 

During showtime, Furla thought of the coach’s words again. It started irritating her when she looked at the other dancers.

“Humph! The coach is unreasonable. Every show is the same anyway,” she grumbled in her heart.

“Furla’s moves are beautiful, but she seems a little awkward with the other dancers…” Audience’s attention was caught by Furla’s offbeat dance.

In the middle of the performance, Furla began to be left behind by the well-practiced dancer.

“Don’t dance too fast!” Furla yelled in her mind, yet the incoherence became more and more obvious.

“I can keep up with them!” 

Furla’s thought didn’t come true as she realized that she was left behind because of the unfamiliar steps.

“Oh no. I lost the pace.”

Bang! Furla eventually slammed into another elf; meanwhile, the rest of the dancers were all tripped by this situation too. At last, the show ended in audience’s surprise and disappointment.

“You’re all fired.” The ringmaster left after making this announcement.

All eyes in the room were staring at Furla at this moment.

“Don’t you blame everything on me! Shouldn’t you be cooperating with the lead dancer?” Furla was pissed off.

“How can you say that!”

“You’re selfish!”

“It’s all your fault!”

As all present elves were offended by Furla’s words, the atmosphere intensified immediately.

“Humph! What’s the bad in getting fired? I don’t wanna dance anyway!” Furla stormed out of the room.

Since then, Furla had started living a laid-back life. On the first day, she felt awesome for doing nothing but lying on bed; on the third day, she started wiggling her limbs; on the seventh day, she had a feeling of missing something…

On the thirtieth day, Furla decide to take a walk as she couldn’t live on this lifestyle anymore. When she was walking in the woods, she came across with a familiar dancer practicing there. It was an elf from her dance troupe.

The dancer was dancing while humming, and Furla somehow followed her rhythm too.

“La la la...Whoa!”

The elf was jumped by Furla who showed up out of nowhere, stumbling onto the ground.

“Ouch...Furla! It’s you,” the elf said cheerfully when she realized that the visitor was Furla.

“Why are you still practicing? We’re all fired. There won’t be any show for us anymore,” said Furla.

“That doesn’t matter. We can still dance! My passion for dancing will not change no matter if I’m in the circus or not. So Furla, you stopped dancing since then?” The elf rubbed her sore leg.

“No,” Furla said, feeling an unspoken guilt.

“We practice together everyday. Do you wanna join us? They’re not far away from here.”

“Humph. Thanks but no thanks,” said Furla with disdain written all over her face.

“What a shame. I’ll see you around then,” the elf said with a hint of disappointment. Then she returned to the gathering point.

The curious Furla tailed her way to their dance area.

“How come? Everyone of them is just average in dancing, but I can’t keep my eyes away from them.”

The surprised Furla felt their passion through their lively dance moves. The dance reminded her of someone——the Furla before becoming the lead.

“I remembered...I used to dance like them too! How can I forget that I used to love dancing more than anyone of them does!”

Since she had become the lead dancer, she had lost her passion in dancing.

A moment later, the dancer noticed someone joined their dance——it was Furla. Yet none of them stopped as if they had already known the thoughts of one another. If there was any audience, this would be the greatest show he or she had ever seen.

“I’m so happy!”

Furla retrieved her passion as if she had revived after the dance.

“Me too! This reminds me of the time when you weren’t the lead. Back then, you would still drag us to practice at night even when you’re excellent in dancing! We thought you were awesome!” All the elves praised Furla.

“Everyone, I’m sorry…”

Unable to hold back the tears anymore, Furla hugged all her fellows in tears of joy.

Few months later, an elf dance troupe came to the entrance of a circus tent.

“Let’s captivate the ringmaster again with our dance!” Furla gripped the recruitment flyer tightly.

“Yeah!”
