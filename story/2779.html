        <h1>Verthandi, Valkyrie of Present</h1>
        <p>
                Time after time, Verthandi watched as her sisters ran themselves down by sedating the madding Odin in the Tower. She knew that it was their destiny that they could not resist, but it did not stop her empathy toward them.

        Leaning alongside her sisters, she fell into a deep slumber, where the elements showed her an illusion of a different choice she could have made…

        Odin sat under the tree planted by Verthandi, but Verthandi helped him up and put him into the swing she used to play on when she was small. Only through undulation and turbulence could she peek into the fate of a person.

        ‘I know why you are here,’ said Verthandi.

        ‘Then will you promise me?’ asked Odin.

        ‘What do you think?’ Verthandi asked him back with a mischievous grin, shrugging her shoulders.

        With his head hanging low, Odin hesitated for a moment and said, ‘Fighting demons is everybody’s responsibility. This is our only choice!’

        Hearing Odin’s rebuttal, Verthandi suddenly found everything uninteresting. She did not understand why this man in front of her was so stubborn and unashamed to drag other people into his own fate when he knew what waited ahead was nothing but tragedy.

        ‘...No, you cannot make decisions for the others.’

        ‘No, I can’t, but still, I’ll say it—we have to do it. There is no other choice for us!’ Odin lifted his head and said, his eyes blazing with determination and staring at Verthandi provocatively. The smile on her face deepened, yet her heart was somehow moved.

        ‘No, you are wrong. At least I can choose not to thread the needle for you, and they still have a choice to leave you and the North.’ Verthandi hurriedly walked away as she threw away her needle. Looking at her back, Odin heaved a deep sigh resignedly.

        Verthandi thought that everyone might be able to break free from the dreadful web of fate as long as she did not thread the needle for Odin and transfer his power to his fellows, but her choice only brought an even worse future…

        Although the warriors of the North did not get Odin’s godly power, they did not run away from the North but confronted the demons to repel the intruders one after another.

        Blood stained every inch of the land in the North; people dropped like meteors, leaving Odin alone.

        In the face of the mighty army of demons, he raised his spear and charged at his foes alone without saying a word.

        For the overuse of godly power, Odin’s soul was close to being completely devoured. He lost all his emotions without even knowing whether he had fallen into madness. He kept slaying every demon in front of him like a slaughter machine, standing tall and still even after the very last moment when the godly power in his body drained and the fire of his life burned out.

        Even the demons were awed by his dignified posture. They dared not blaspheme his body but only left it standing on the battlefield that was littered with corpses, until one evening when Verthandi came.

        Verthandi, who had always been smiling, now lost her composure; her eyes were filled with grief and sorrow.

        ‘It turns out that you were right. They have been linked to you by the thread of fate all along.’ Verthandi took out her needle and said, ‘As it should be, I, as both the thread and the needle, shall weave the web of fate for you.’

        Wetting the thread, Verthandi passed it through the eye of the needle and pulled. Then, she pierced the needle fiercely into Odin’s body, sewing his fate onto herself.

        Amid the howling wind in the North, she continued to weave silently until the sun sank below the horizon. As she finished weaving, she reached out her blood-stained hands and took the Gungnir out of Odin’s. Then she put on the Armor of Runes and carried on the fate that should have belonged to him…

        “The web of fate is irrevocable. All creatures are powerless before its greatness.”</p>
