        <p>        “In the future, I want to be like my parents.  I shall develop first-rate martial skills and a reputation that spreads across the four seas.  With that, I would be a just Chinese Paladin in the martial world!”

        When he was young, Li Hsiao-Yao would play pretend: his chopsticks served as a sword while his stacked utensils were Yaoguais.  Everyday, he would decapitate “Yaoguais” with his ferocious swordsmanship with the “sword” in one hand and the “decapitated heads” in the other.  Another way Li Hsiao-Yao would play was to use his chopsticks as legs and his other palm as a person; he would make sound effects with his mouth, as he “sword fought” with pots of plants.

        Bearing a strong sense of justice, Li Hsiao-Yao always dreamt of becoming a great martial artisan and this dream of hunting Yaoguais remained unchanged even when he reached his teens.  Later, Li Hsiao-Yao journeyed to Fairy Island to seek a panacea to treat his family member.
