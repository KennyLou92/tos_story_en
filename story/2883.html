        <h1>Eons of Flora - Gaia</h1>
        <p>        As Gaia regained her power from the giant tree in the Divine Woodland, she accidentally delved into the tree’s memories and discovered that the gods had seized the elements in the continent of  Tarones, leading to numerous wars and disasters that befell the humans.

        Overwhelmed with guilt, she decided to help the humans and the land by sabotaging the gods’ device used to extract the elements. However, her actions were discovered by Aether.

        A dispute erupted between the two goddesses. Gaia found herself no match for Aether, who was backed by Khaos, and was inevitably wounded. Fortunately, she managed to make her escape in a flock of running animals.

        “Da-darn it! What are these vines made of? Why are they getting tighter?” During Gaia’s escape, she heard a loud cry from a girl somewhere in the forest. She could tell the girl’s spirited personality just from the tone as the girl shouted, “ Ugh! Help! Can somebody help me?”

        ‘...Let’s go and take a look.’ Sitting atop a floral deer, Gaia raised her head and motioned the deer with a gentle pat. The deer swiftly turned its heels and ran toward the direction of the girl’s cries.

        In no time, they came across a girl who was tightly entangled by some vines in mid-air. The comical sight left Gaia so dumbfounded that she could not help but think, ‘What on earth did she do to get herself stuck like this?’

        “Oh, oh, oh! You, beautiful lady over there! I’m so glad you’re here! Could you please help me?” The girl called out to Gaia eagerly. However, instead of helping the girl right away, Gaia observed her cautiously. With her voice tinged with wariness, she asked, “How did you end up stuck in the vines?”

        “Well… I…” The girl stammered, seemingly reluctant to tell the truth, which made Gaia even more alert. Her tone grew colder as she asked, “I’m afraid I can’t help you if you’re not willing to tell me the truth.”

        “Umm… Okay! Fine! I’ll tell you!” The girl closed her eyes and sheepishly confessed, “It’s all because I was feeling peckish. The fruits on this tree looked so tempting that I climbed up to pick them, but I slipped and fell into this pile of vines!”

        Coincidentally, the girl’s stomach growled as if to prove her point, bringing a scarlet flush to her face. As embarrassing as it was, her candid reaction earned Gaia’s favor, prompting her to let her guard down.

        As Gaia gently put her hand on the deer’s body, the deer gracefully leaped to the front of the tree so that Gaia could press her hands against the trunk and channel her power. Sensing her will, the tree loosened the vines and freed the girl who began stretching her tingling limbs after she landed on the ground safely.

        “Thank you for helping me,” said the girl with a bright smile. She seemed to have an infectiously ceaseless positive energy that even inspired Gaia, who was feeling low at the moment.

        However, the joyful atmosphere was abruptly interrupted by a scream.

        ‘The animals are in distress! Someone is attacking the forest! I have to protect them!’ Gaia’s expression changed. She quickly mounted the deer and left, paying no attention to the girl.

        The deer carried Gaia to the entrance of the forest. Yet, the once flourishing forest was now littered with the corpses of animals, and the earth was stained with crimson. The gruesome scene ignited a fiery anger with Gaia, turning her eyes red. Her gaze was coldly directed on the marauding hordes of demons responsible for such devastation.

        “No one shall harm the animals and this land!” Gaia shouted, channeling her power to summon a ball of powerful green light. Numerous tree saplings emerged from the ground and attacked the rampaging demon troop. Meanwhile, soft vines sprouted between the branches, providing aid to the injured animals.

        However, the demons kept coming, and Gaia’s fatigue began to show since she had already depleted her power while destroying the extraction device, coupled with the injuries she had received during her fight with Aether. Seizing the opportunity, the demon army gathered and relentlessly poured through the breaches.

        Just as the demon army was about to break through into the forest, a dazzling flash of light appeared, forming a magical barrier that blocked their entry point. Standing not far from the barrier was the girl whom Gaia had saved earlier, holding a staff emanating a soft glow of magic. It was she who had conjured the barrier.

        However, the situation remained dire even with the girl’s help. Her face contorted as she quickly grew overwhelmed and shouted, “Whoa! There are too many of them! I can’t deal with them alone! Blond guy, come out and help me!”

        In response to her plea, a translucent figure materialized. It was a young nobleman dressed in aristocratic attire with shoulder-length blonde hair that seemed even more luxurious than the girl’s. His exquisite features were so refined that they transcended the boundaries of gender. Still, the resolute aura he exuded revealed his identity as a masculine male. He was Earl Nathaniel, one of the heroes in the past. His soul had been long fused into the elements, yet a soul that represented the origin awakened him and tasked him with guiding the girl to the place of destiny.

        Giving the girl a resigned look, Nathaniel crossed his arms and said, “I’m afraid I can’t be of much help. There are too many demons.”

        “Then, then, what do we do? We can’t let them kill those adorable bunnies!”

        “...Didn’t you awaken your power?” Nathaniel sighed as he put a hand on his forehead.

        “Oh! Right!” Nathaniel’s question woke the girl. Revitalizing her spirit, she called out loudly, “Heroic spirits of the past, help me take down my enemies!”

        Suddenly, countless rays of light shimmered into existence as an army of slimes equal in number to the demon army emerged and began pushing back against the demon troops.

        Gaia immediately joined forces with the girl to drive away the demon army. Seeing the sudden powerful reinforcement, the demon army scattered in retreat and the forest’s peace was restored.

        Gaia approached the girl, gratitude evident in her expression as she said, “Thank you for lending a hand earlier.”

        “No need to thank me. We were simply returning a favor,” the girl responded.

        “...You mean freeing you from the vines?”

        The girl shook her head with a smile, her eyes filled with wisdom and insight. “No, I’m talking about your decision to destroy the extraction device, breaking away from the Holy Gods for the sake of humanity and this continent.”

        “How do you know about that?” Gaia asked.

        “The souls in the forest told me,” the girl explained, extending a hand toward the air as if comforting someone, “Though I may not summon powerful heroic spirits as my brother does, I can hear the voices of the most insignificant souls. They told me about everything you’ve done.”

        As implausible as the girl sounded, Gaia fully believed her words. She smiled wryly and said, “Then, you have no reason to thank me either. My people are clearly in the wrong all along.”

        “And you chose to stop it, and that sole reason is enough for us to be grateful. But Goddess Gaia, since you’ve turned your back on the Holy Gods, what do you plan to do next?”

        “I… I want to make things right. This land shouldn’t wither away like this.”

        “Alright then,”  the girl beamed brightly and continued, “Come with me to the Enochian Tower and make things right for this world.”

        Persuaded by the girl’s words, Gaia left the Divine Woodland and set off for the Enochian Tower, determined to contribute her power to the future of this land…</p>
