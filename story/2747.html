        <p>
        Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.8

        With the help of her companions, Arthur gathered the Star Stones, drew out the Excalibur successfully and defeated Mordred. As the vile core had been broken, the imperial soldier armored with dark metal was no longer controlled by black magic.

        After the loss of their leader, the imperial army was brought to the brink of chaos but was soon conquered by the Excalibur. Later, Bedivere led the opposition party and subdued the remnants of Mordred’s party. She then convinced the people to support Arthur by spreading the news of the Excalibur being drawn out. Eventually, the long-illed Accolon announced abdication.

        This day was Arthur’s coronation. 

        The sun poured in the palace. Arthur stood in the middle of the room with her arms open and a blush of embarrassment when Merlin and Guinevere were helping her get in the full royal gown.  Merlin straightened her collar, then said with a satisfied smile, ‘Arthur, finally you’re wearing something decent. Try more dresses after you take the throne!’

        ‘No! This gown is so tight and troublesome. It takes too much time to put it on——Ouch! It‘s too tight. I can't breathe!’ yelled Arthur. Guinevere, who was girding her waist, immediately let go and said, ‘Sorry. Is it better now?’

        ‘How about you do it for me, Guinevere? Let Merlin disguise you as me. You sure will be more decent than me! ‘ Arthur suggested.

        The two instantly shook their head. Guinevere giggled, ‘I can’t draw the Excalibur. You have to do it yourself!’

        ‘Oh right! My sword!’ Arthur wanted to turn around but she was restrained by the tight-fitting dress. Afraid that she might tear the dress apart, Merlin immediately held her shoulders and stopped her.

        Just then, Galahad’s voice came from her back, ‘I have cleaned the scabbard for you. Take it!’

        ‘It is the real Excalibur this time, right?’ asked Arthur.

        ‘Of course! If you don’t believe me, just unsheathe it yourself!’ Galahad came to Arthur, blushed with anger and shame.

        Slowly pushing up her long sleeves, Arthur wanted to pet Galahad’s head but the latter dodged it and ran right away. ‘I’ve told you many times. Don’t treat me like a kid!’

        Galahad was so absorbed in talking to Arthur that she almost bumped into Bedivere, who was coming right in the door.

        When everyone saw Bedivere, they greeted her with a respectful nod then showed her Arthur’s look elatedly. As Arthur turned around stiffly, Bedivere expressed amazement at seeing her dressed with formality and elegance. She then stepped forward, straightened Arthur’s dress, leaned back and took a look. Her eyes were filled with love and profound emotions.

        Bedivere gave Arthur a hug then held her arm and looked her in the eye, ‘From today on, you will be the lord of the kingdom. You can no longer act recklessly.’

        ‘Sure! I will become a better king than my father!’ Arthur said confidently with her arms akimbo. Just as she was about to step forward, she almost tripped because of the unfamiliar high heels.

        Merlin promptly held her up and said with a sigh, ‘But first, you have to learn how to walk elegantly.’

        Bedivere smiled and said, ‘That’s right. You still have a lot to learn after you’ve become the king. But I’m relieved since you have them by your side.’

        Then She looked around the room. Everyone gave a bright smile as they heard her. ‘Alright, the ceremony is going to start soon.’

        Following Bedivere’s lead, Arthur stepped into the hall. All people stood up as the horns echoed. In the seats, she saw some familiar faces-Gareth and his father were standing next to each other, while Tristan and Lamorak were standing on the other side. They all looked at Arthur with respectful and expectant eyes.

        Holding their swords, Gawain and Lancelot were already standing in front of the stage with one on the left and one on the right. As Arthur walked closer, the corners of their lips couldn’t help but curve up with blessings shining in their eyes.

        Arthur carefully walked up the stairs. As she bowed and lowered her head, Bedivere placed the crown upon her. The two met eye to eye and smiled. After Bedivere gave her a nod, Arthur turned around and was greeted with a big round of applause from her people.

        Then, Arthur and her trusted aides, which were her friends, walked to the balcony to meet her people. Bedivere stepped to the back and watched with her arms crossed.

        Under the witness of the crowd, Arthur unsheathed the radiant Excalibur. The sacrosanct light of holiness left the crowd in awe. As the light faded, thundering cheers and applause broke out. People yelled, ‘May the holy light be with King Arthur!’

        The bell rang; ribbons and confetti flew in the air. Smiling, Arthur waved at the crowd then looked at Bedivere.

        Bedivere smiled as well and nodded, sighed in her heart, ‘King Uther, I’ve done my best for what you have entrusted me. Arthur has inherited your kindness. It must be her will of protecting others, that has earned the recognition of the Excalibur.’

        “There is still much for her to learn in the coming days, but don’t worry. She has a bunch of great friends. I believe she will be a great king with their help!” Bedivere looked up and saw a flock of birds glide across the sunny sky.</p>
