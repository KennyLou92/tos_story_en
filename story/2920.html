        <h1>Karmatic Affliction - Varuna</h1>
        <p>Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.5

        In Sinha, two warriors faced each other in the center of the arena.

        One of the warriors was the renowned champion of a recent martial arts tournament. Originally, he was scheduled to face the king of Sinha, Varuna, in an epic battle. However, the duel was postponed as Varuna was plagued by chronic pain after his sense of pain had been revitalized by accident.

        Fortunately, a one-eyed courtier introduced a physician named Brahma to Varuna. The physician somehow managed to restore his insensitivity to pain as well as his confidence. It was in light of this remarkable “recovery” that the duel was rearranged.

        With a resounding cry, the duel commenced. The warrior charged toward Varuna with ferocious momentum to initiate an attack. Driven by his indomitable spirit, Varuna did not flinch but instead used his sturdy arms to block the attack, fighting the warrior head-on.

        A thunderous collision reverberated through the air as the two collided. The impact propelled the warrior backward several steps. The color drained from his face when he felt an intense pain. Meanwhile, Varuna remained unfazed because he felt no pain. The absence of fear only fueled his resolve, prompting him to seize the moment and launch a counterattack against his opponent.

        Although the warrior managed to evade Varuna’s first powerful punches, he strength soon waned. Ultimately, he took a devastating blow from Varuna which left him in a dire situation. With his spirit worn away by the spasm of pain, the warrior had no choice but to surrender.

        The moment Varuna raised his arms in triumph, the audience broke into thunderous applause and cheers that reverberated through the ground. All the warriors in the arena looked at their invincible king with frenzied admiration.

        “King Varuna! The mightiest of all!” they shouted, their voices booming like temple bells.

        ‘I am invincible as long as I don’t feel any pain!’ Varuna thought while basking in the warriors’ reverent gaze. A gloating smile spread across his face as if he had returned to the glorious days when pain was unknown to him.

        However, fear is an unforgettable nightmare that keeps haunting those who have experienced it.  The deep-rooted terror often remains indelible in one’s heart even if the wounds have been healed.

        Later that night, Varuna lay in his chamber in the place with his eyes tightly shut beneath a furrowed brow. Beads of cold sweat covered his forehead as he was plagued by a nightmarish vision. His lips trembled with fearful murmurs, “No... Stay away from me...Not the pain, not again!”
　
        Suddenly, Varuna woke up from his dream. His heart pounded as he sat up straight. The vivid images from his dream raced through his mind—a blue-skinned man posing his hands to give him a strike. Even in his dream, Varuna subconsciously ran away like a defeated dog knowing how agonizing the pain would be if the strike landed on him.

        “Shiva… I can never find peace in my slumber until I get rid of that man!” Varuna grumbled through his clenched teeth. To his surprise, Agni brought him great news just as he was about to have him dispatch more men to track down Shiva the following day.

        “Your Majesty, I have captured Shiva,” Agni kneeled before Varuna and reported humbly.

        “Is it true?!” Excited By the news, Varuna quickly rose from his throne and urged, “Take me to him immediately!”

        “Yes, Your Majesty.”

        Varuna followed Agni to a damp and dimly lit dungeon where Shiva was bound tightly to an iron pillar in a cell, his head hanging low, devoid of strength, The wounds on his body hinted at the brutal interrogation and torture he had experienced.

        Varuna walked toward Shiva. He forcefully gripped and lifted Shiva’s chin. Leaning in close, he wore an arrogantly triumphant smile, his eyes filled with disgust spawned from hatred.

        “I’ve finally got you, you despicable rat— Ugh!” Varuna’s taunting words turned into a startled cry as Shiva suddenly spat at him, causing him to reflexively release his grip and step back.

        “Hahaha! I’ve been waiting to do this for so long!” Shiva laughed spiritedly, shedding his feeble act.

        “You—!” Varuna glared furiously at Shiva, his chest heaving vigorously. With a flush of scarlet rage spreading over his face, he reached for the whip hanging beside the bed and violently swung it at Shiva regardless of the saliva remaining on his cheek—

        Crack! Crack! Crack! The sound of a cracking whip echoed in the confined cell for a while until Varuna’s breath came in short gasps.

        Unexpectedly, Shiva clenched his teeth, refusing to emit even a single groan of pain despite the ruthless torture that nearly robbed him of consciousness. Yet, his stubborn resilience only further displeased Varuna, who felt an inexplicable sense of defeat and frustration that finally culminated in a fervent desire for bloodshed.

        Clang!

        Varuna unsheathed his dagger hanging from his belt. The flickering firelight on the wall reflected off the blade and fell in Shiva’s hazy vision. He was fully aware of Varuna’s intent and the imminent danger that was about to befall him. However, his body was so terribly battered that he could only helplessly watch the tyrant walk toward him step by step…

        ‘Am I going to die? At the hands of this wretched king?’ Shiva desperately lifted his heavy eyelids, gazing at Varuna, who was seething with murderous intent. Suddenly, his spirit seemed to detach from his physical form and connect with a certain presence; his vision completely cleared.

        All of a sudden, everything transformed into an array of lights and shadows in Shiva’s eyes, and the man standing before him, Varuna, was completely filled by dark shadows, like a mere black void that was devoid of fluidity and energy.

        ‘His… His life force has ceased its circulation and reached the end.’ For some inexplicable reason, Shiva had a thorough grasp of Varuna’s existence. ‘His sins have grown into a piece of rotten fruit. A single guidance is all it takes to lead him toward the end.’

        Shiva slowed his breath and moved his fingers to form multiple intricate seals. Then, as if maneuvered by some invisible force, the shadows around Varuna gradually entered and gathered within his body, accumulating until it reached its limit…

        “Argh!” Varuna suddenly stumbled and fell to the ground. He attempted to stand only to find his hands devoid of strength. Perplexed, he looked down and discovered that the skin on his hands and feet had all cracked. Little did he know that his movements had hastened his own collapse due to his insensibility to pain.

        “Wh-what is happening?” Varuna roared out his question, refusing to accept reality.

        “This is the consequence of your misdeeds,” Shiva explained.

        “No! It can’t be!” Varuna bellowed, “I am the king of Sinha…  I’m not supposed to die like this… I am pain-free and I should be INVINCIBLE!”

        “You’re wrong…” Shiva slowly stood up. Looking down at Varun, who was crawling on the ground, he said, “Pain is a bestowal from nature. It reminds us of the presence of danger and serves as a warning not to harm others. Yet, you chose to forsake it and disregard the warnings. You let your soul be contaminated and consumed by shadows. It is your stubbornness that leads you to your demise.”

        “No… I don’t… I don’t want to die…” No matter how hard Varuna struggled, he could not stop his body from disintegrating, and eventually, he turned into a pile of dust that scattered into the air.

        Just like that, the mightiest warrior vanished without a trace. The scene filled Agni, who had been watching from the side, with sheer terror that compelled him to hastily flee from the dungeon, leaving Shiva alone in the cell.</p>
