        <h1>Evil-fighting Pincers - John</h1>
        <p>        While the war between the gods and the demons plunged the entire Tarones into chaos, people continued to struggle for survival in this land of suffering.

        John was one of those people. Living in an unkempt and lawless ghetto with his ailing mother, the teenage boy scraped a living for his family by working until dark every night.

        Yet, today was rather different. John went back to his home—a dilapidated house made of tin sheets—brimming with joy despite his fatigued body. He opened the door with a high squeak that awakened the middle-aged woman on the bed.

        ‘John… You’re back,’ said the woman who looked sickly pale and scrawny. Even the words that came from her mouth sounded morbidly weak.

        ‘Mom! I have great news!’ John eagerly shared the news with his mother. He continued, ‘The Earl’s manor is recruiting tomorrow and I’ve applied for a position. I can take you to a better doctor as soon as I pass the interview!’

        ‘That’s great… But don’t make it all about me. You should take care of yourself more.’

        The mother’s words of love warmed John’s heart, so he replied with a smile, ‘Don’t worry. I’m strong. I’ll definitely pass the interview tomorrow and take you out of this filthy place.’

        To John, the ghetto was like a den of demons—it is a place where people yield to temptation,  lose their conscience, and compromise their principles for something unlawful.

        The gangsters and thugs in the ghetto had tried to include John many times but he never wavered. He stuck to his principles, believing that he would one day leave this swamp of evil from the bottom of his heart.

        After a long time of waiting, he finally got his chance. He could live in the Earl’s manor and stay far away from the sordid ghetto as soon as he got a position in the manor.

        To prepare for the interview, John went to bed early and woke up before dawn. After spending the entire morning grooming himself, he left home for the interview while his mother saw him off. As expected, his extraordinary agility and intelligence got him a job in the position.

        John was overjoyed when he learned the result. He hurriedly ran back home to tell his mother the great news. He even bought a premium steak from the butcher shop on the way which he had never dared to walk in for celebration. However, his excitement was soon shattered into pieces as he opened the door of his house—

        There was a man on top of his mother whose eyes were slightly widened. Yet, the woman had already breathed her last. She lay motionless on the bed with her arm hanging from the side; John could still see the bulging veins on his hands.

        Ceaseless rage welled up in John’s body like a mountainous wave. He felt as if someone was pounding his heart to rubble but he did not shed a tear or scream. Instead, he quietly took a blade and went to the man’s back while the latter focused on his sexual violence.

        ‘ARGH—!’ It was when John pushed the blade through the man’s body that he let out a wail of anguish. However, it was just the beginning—soon after John withdrew the blade, he took an axe beside him and chopped off the man’s legs. Blood splashed everywhere with a groan of pain echoing around the house.

        Still, the man’s groan was not enough to quell John’s wrath for he had crushed the boy’s world. John thought that he and his mother could live a happy life as long as he stayed honest and righteous, only to find that he was just a blissfully ignorant fool who was unaware of the evil that had been following around him like a shadow. And so, John continued to torment the man until he heard someone’s scream.

        ‘Mur… Murderer! There’s a murderer!’

        It was John’s neighbor who came to his door out of curiosity as he heard the noise next door. Little did he expect to see such a gory scene that made him flee with a scream in terror.

        Instead of getting into a panic, John decisively killed the man and ran out of the house with her mother’s body on his shoulder after he was discovered by his neighbor. Yet, the murder made John a wanted man and it completely shattered his dream of working in the Earl’s manor.

        John buried his mother in the quiet countryside and made a simple tombstone with a pile of stones. In the fine rain, he stood beside the tombstone. Poker-faced, he whispered, ‘Mom, I can never get out of the mire no matter how much I want to because I can’t get rid of the evil inside me; it’s everywhere.’

        Afterward, John gave up his long-held beliefs and became an apprentice to an old assassin who taught him all kinds of killing techniques, starting over as an assassin…</p>
