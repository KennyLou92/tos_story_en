        <h1>Masterful Blades - Imanotsurugi & Usumidori</h1>
        <p>
                Imanotsurugi and Usumidori, the spritis of the dark swords, were once humans. However, they were later sealed in their swords by Gods for the innumerable lives they had taken. Kept in the Enochian Tower, the two swore to serve whoever broke their seal. Belatedly, they met Minamoto no Yoshitsune.

        At first, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori did think of serving their master loyally; it was just that Yoshitsune had let them down again and again.

        Imanotsurugi and Usumidori believed that one must abandon everything and pursue power at all costs so as to succeed and become the strong. Although Yoshitsune had the heart of becoming the strong, he had the White Queen, who had been holding his back from becoming the toughest man of all.

        So Imanotsurugi and Usumidori plotted together to take over Yoshitsune’s body.

        They thereupon undermined Yoshitsune’s spirit step by step, inflicting hallucinatory torments upon him. Now, they were only one step away from completely crushing Yoshitsune’s will. To do that, there was a perfectly effective way, which was to kill the one he valued the most—the White Queen.

        Defeated by Lü Bu again, Yoshitsune fled back to the White Queen’s castle with wounds all over his body. He then slipped into a coma for some reason.

        Worriedly, the White Queen bandaged up the unconscious Yoshitsune and saw all the cuts and wounds on his body left from his fight with Lü Bu.

        ‘Why isn’t he waking up?’ Looking at Yoshitsune, who had been senseless for a long time, the White Queen burst into tears.

        ‘Master can’t wake up.’ A faint voice came from the two swords of Yoshitsune. ‘He is wounded to the core, which will keep him in slumber forever.’

        ‘Who are you?’ asked the White Queen callously, burying the vulnerability in her sobs just now.
        ‘I’m Imanotsurugi.’ 
        ‘I’m Usumidori. We’re the Master’s swords.’
        The swords said softly, ‘If you want to save Master… We need your help.’

        ‘What can I do?’ The familia evil pneuma on the swords let the White Queen’s guard down.

        ‘You just have to hold us in your hand. With your power and Master’s power stored in us, we can definitely bring Master back.’

        ‘I will do anything as long as it can help him!’ said the frail White Queen firmly, standing up straight. As she picked up the two swords, she could feel her powers being drawn out by them instantly. However, Yoshitsune’s face didn’t reddened but grew pallid.

        Sensing the anomaly, the White Queen wanted to get rid of the swords yet failed as though they had been glued to her hands.

        ‘What… do you want?’ The White Queen could feel that her body was weakening slowly, with her mind fading away.

        Just then, two male figures gradually materialized before her. They looked just like Imanotsurugi and Usumidori before they were turned into the spirits of the dark swords.

        ‘What do we want? Go ask Yoshitsune in hell!’ They each held a sword in their hands, then they approached the defenseless White Queen with a sinister smile…</p>
