        <h1>Wilhelm Van Astrea</h1>
        <p>
        He is a master of swordsmanship who is once known throughout the kingdom as the Sword Devil.
As an extremely devoted husband, he expresses his deep love for his wife, Theresia Van Astrea, the former Master Swordsman, in a way so straightforwardly that even staggers Subaru.
While serving as Cruschâ€™s butler, he has been waiting for a chance to avenge his wife who was killed by the White Whale, and thus he is deeply grateful to Subaru for providing him with that opportunity.</p>
