        <h1>Bonding of Nature - Barbara</h1>
        <p>        In the embrace of the wind, Barbara had a dream of her alternative life accompanied by the elements in the air and voice of Byakhee…

        “...The breeze continues to circulate. It is your breath that brings vitality! The immortality provides shade for me, and the towering giant tree shelters all beings…”

        The wizard in front of her chanted prayers, making it difficult for Barbara to hear the whispers of the wind anymore. She held a wooden ball in her hand, looking around curiously. The elders and adults were all watching where they were all intently. The surrounding floating stones reflected the green light of the circle, and the children nearby were embracing each other anxiously…

        Suddenly, the wind was blowing violently. Everyone remained calm, except Barbara who was the only one understanding the implied warning. “Leave now!”

        The magic circle began to emit a strong green light; sounds like flies vibrating wings were surging in everyone’s heart. The children screamed in panic, while Barbara immediately followed the wind's warning to escape from the circle!

        “Hey! Don’t run away!” The wizard wanted to stop Barbara but his attention was caught by a Dracospirit summoned in the circle…

        “The spirit has dawned! It’s my honor to receive your blessing!”

        Barbara ran desperately. Her petite body was rushing among the bushes, until she could no longer hear the footsteps chasing behind. By then she realized that she was lost in the woods. Barbara held up the magic ball in her hand, unfortunately receiving no guidance. She had to listen to the sound of the wind.

        “Something is approaching!”

        Several werewolves emerged; Barbara drew back in horror. When she was about to be attacked, another wild beast repelled! The shadow let out an intimidating roar above Barbara, frightening the werewolves back. As she turned around, a white tiger was seen, which was staring at herself with a pair of sharp eyes...

        The wooden ball suddenly emitted a soft green light. Drawn by which, the white tiger became tame and gentle, crouching before Barbara with a curious look. Noticed by the sound of the wind, Barbara knew that the white tiger was not hostile, so she stretched out her hand to stroke its fur. They met and became the support of each other. Barbara used the magic ball to feed the white tiger with earth elements; in return, the white tiger protected Barbara from monsters. Years had passed. Barbara had grown into a young girl, and the white tiger became huge and stronger than before.

        “Leave, gnomes! This is our territory!” Barbara swung a staff that evolved from a wooden ball as she ran. The core of the staff radiated a green light as it absorbed the elements from the gnomes. The white tiger leaped to Barbara's side and watched them fleeing.

        “Alright, what next...Let’s take the elements from the elves then!” However, the white tiger remained still, as if signalling her to stop.

        “Why! Are you sure such a small amount of elements can fill your stomach?” Barbara was puzzled, but still insisted on heading towards the habitat of the elves, who ran away immediately as soon as she came. When Barbara raised her staff, the white tiger stood in the way between her and the elves.

        “Don’t overdo it. Must maintain, ecological, balance.” The white tiger's heartfelt voice reached Barbara through the wind of elements. Putting down the staff, she let the white tiger breath towards the core, which released the light of the elements, eventually turning into a breeze sent across the jungle. Nourished by the elements, the elves were energized, and the whole forest was blessed with shine and vitality...

        “The evergreen forest is truly beautiful…” Barbara felt.

        However, an uninvited guest was drawn by the wind——a giant toad, which leaped over and smashed the woods; its shockwave turned into the wind sharp as a blade to destroy everything around. The giant toad not only absorbed the elements nearby, but also devoured the lives of the forest. From the sound of the wind, Barbara learned that there was greater power hidden in this strange beast, and the sound of the wing vibration resembling a fly evoked her deep memory...

        “I won’t let you destroy our home even if you’re the emissary of the Ethereal Dragon!”

        Barbara raised her staff to collect the elements in the wind, and directed this power into the body of the white tiger to make it even bigger. With a pair of green, glowing eyes, it became a ferocious beast that was evenly matched with the giant toad. At last, the enemy was defeated; the elements were given back to the creatures of the woods. The rescued live beings thanked Barbara and the white tiger for the good deed, and praised them as the guardians of the forest.

        As the defeated giant toad was unable to provide elements, the starving Ethereal Dragon could no longer remain silent but let out an echoing roar in the wind...The sound sent an earthquake from the obelisk to the city and the jungle. People were all into a panic because of the shuddering roar. The voice came to Barbara's ears through the wind. She was able to understand it, and felt the dragon’s desire. Touching the white tiger, Barbara gazed at the source of the wind——Cassilda ruins.

        “The woods coexist with the wind. No one can monopolize the elements. For the eternity of this land, I have to protect it at all costs!”</p>
