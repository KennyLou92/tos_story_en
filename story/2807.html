        <h1>Seraphic Soar - Auriga</h1>
        <p>
                ‘I’m a constellation blessed by the astralist. I shine for the peace of this realm,’ the determined Auriga said to Athena righteously, and he continued, ‘I will not tolerate any beings who try to break the world’s balance, not even the sacred gods!’

        ‘Do you really think you can defeat me by hitting me once?’ Athena got back up, using her spear as a cane. She wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth, her eyes flaring with rage. She said, ‘What a foolish man! Now let me bring you back to reality!’

        As Athena held her spear vertically, a bolt of lightning suddenly flew across the sky and struck her. Astonishingly, the lightning did not hurt her but ran along her body like a shield, healing all the wounds Auriga had inflicted on her in an instant.

        It was a blessing from Zeus, the King of Gods, to his daughter, Athena, the Goddess of War, wishing for her victory. 

        Auriga was stunned by the illogical phenomenon until he heard Galio shouting——

        ‘Don’t just stand there! She’s coming!’

        ‘Eh?’ In the blink of an eye, Athena rushed to the front of Auriga with her deadly spear aiming right at his head. Fortunately, Auriga’s fighting instincts kicked in—he raised his weapon to cover his forehead and narrowly escaped the fate of his head being pierced through by the spear.

        However, his weapon was not as lucky as he was. With a clunk, his weapon broke into two under Athena’s crushing power. When Auriga glanced at the shattered weapon in his hand after jumping back clumsily, a shudder passed through his body.

        “This was a weapon given by the ancient gods but she just broke it in one blow. Given her delicate appearance, she is unreasonably strong. That’s a complete fraud! No one would ever like a violent liar like that so I bet she must be single!” thought Auriga, who was plunged into a state of confusion by the sudden attack.

        On the contrary, Athena was breathtakingly calm. Wielding her spear, she went after Auriga again like a venomous snake pursuing its prey. Without another weapon to deflect the attack this time, Auriga could only cross his arms before his vitals. Unexpectedly, he did not feel any pain but heard a groan of pain.

        ‘Argh!’ Even though Galio raised his sword to protect himself, his wounded body still failed to withstand Athena’s power, resulting in him being smashed into a tree. 

        ‘Galio!’ Auriga screamed with agitation.

        ‘It’s you again… Now be gone!’ Gritting her teeth, Athena aimed her spear at Galio to give him the final blow——

        “No! Don’t hurt my friend!” Auriga came back to his senses as he saw Galio take the attack for him. Suddenly, an unknown burning sensation ran through his body and concentrated in his right hand, heating his weapon that had been shattered by Athena. From the crack of the weapon rose a new blade of flames.

        ‘STOP IT!’ Auriga dashed to stop Athena. Perhaps it was the fit of rage—he and Athena fought neck and neck, and startlingly, he was the one getting the upper hand.

        “I have to take her down!”

        However, a few flying arrows came from a distance and shattered Auriga’s hope—the god soldiers finally came to Athena’s aid!

        “Uh… Galio is injured. I can’t keep fighting her. We have to get out of here before the soldiers surround us!” Clamping his teeth together, Auriga swung a heavy blow at Athena and knocked her away. Then he turned around and ran toward the carriage while picking up the wounded Galio, who was lying on the ground.

        After getting into the carriage, Auriga scrambled up to the driver’s seat. As soon as he gently tugged the reins, Mr. Horse began to run. Yet, it was stopped before it could take the third step—its body and the carriage were both entangled with the vines that sprouted up from the ground.

        ‘Humph! You can’t run away from me!’ As Athena waved her hand, the vines rose into the air along with the horse, the carriage and the people inside it.
　　
        ‘No…’ Still, Auriga’s eyes were shining like stars. The light in his eyes did not die in the adversity but burned even brighter. When he put his hands on the carriage, the burning sensation reappeared and circulated through his body again, turning into sparks that blossomed in his palms!

        ‘No one can stop the flames of hope! Even the weak can blaze a trail of their own!’ With a low shout, Auriga summoned the astralist power inside his body. The burst of power generated a blinding light like a supernova and enveloped the horse and the carriage.

        In the next second, a pair of extravagant fire wings spread from Mr. Horse’s body. With a neigh, Mr. Hoses flapped the wings. The sparks on it fell onto the vines and started a magnificent fire that burned all the vines around the carriage down in an instant.

        The moment Mr. Horse regained freedom, it led the carriage into the air, leaving a trace of vivid red flames in the sky. Still, some god soldiers tried to shoot arrows at the carriage but the trace of flames burned them all before they could reach it.

        And so, Athena could only watch the carriage recede into the distance and eventually disappeared on the horizon.

        ‘Phew… We made it.’ After wiping the cold sweat from his forehead, Auriga looked at Galio, who was lying weakly, and said anxiously, ‘We need to find a place to treat your wound’——」

        ‘No. Go to the Enochian Tower.’ Holding Auriga’s hand, Galio continued, ‘They… My friends are still there, waiting for me.’

        ‘Okay.’ Auriga nodded. Just when he was about to tug the reins, he seemed to have remembered something and looked back at Galio timidly, adding,  ‘But don’t you die on me, okay?’

        ‘...I won’t. I don’t want to be jinxed,’ said Galio, who took a moment to choke back his anger.

        ‘That’s good to hear.’ Auriga nodded in satisfaction. As he finally pulled the reins, Mr. Horse let out a soft neigh and flew in the direction of the Enochian Tower…</p>
