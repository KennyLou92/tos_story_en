        <h1>Baneful Grandiosity - Shamash</h1>
        <p>
                A loud noise echoed through the medical room in the depths of Oroz, the underground city. In a fit of rage, a female machina swept everything off the table in front of her. Unsatisfied, she extended her metallic arms and forcefully scratched the wall, leaving ferocious marks on it.

        It was until a moment that the woman stopped and slumped to the ground, like a deflated balloon. Her eyes held a mix of emotions—disbelief, anger, and shame—as she stared at her metallic hands resting on her knees. Her delicate fingers remained slender but now devoid of warmth. All she could feel was a cold, metallic touch.

        “Why…why have I become such a hideous form?” the woman questioned. When she finally grasped the reality, her swelling anger turned into agonizing despair, compelling tears to overflow. In a corner of the medical room lay the lifeless body of a male machina. His spiritless eyes seemed to question how his act of kindness had led to his own demise.

        The woman, Shamash, was not born a machina but an Eldus, a superior species that resided on the distant planet of Akkad. She had ventured to this planet with her companions in search of their mother, the origin of their kind.

        Unfortunately, the natives of the planet, the machinas, obstructed her from taking their mother, monesis, away. In desperation, she resorted to various means to coerce the machinasm only to provoke the native’s leader, Pompeii. After Pompeii defeated Shamash, he sealed monesis along with himself within the Pilgrimage in the depths of Mech City.

        On the verge of death, Shamash was rescued by a machina named Lambda. He brought her back to the medical room and infused the golden liquid into her body so that she would be reborn as a machina. Little did he know that his genuine act of kindness would crush the egotistic Shamash, who perforated his kinetic core, the essence of his life, with a blow.

        “No… I can’t accept what is happening…. I’d rather die if I have to live like this… I must regain my original form…” The consecutive setbacks and dreadful spectacle drove Shamash into madness. After a moment of silence, her eyes suddenly gleamed. She straightened up with a twisted smile forming on her lips, and murmured, “Right… I still have Mother… Mother will definitely restore me to my beautiful form… As long as I can get Mother’s power… The Pilgrimage… Mother is still imprisoned there by those despicable machinas. I have to go and free Mother…”

        As if Shamash had grasped a life-saving straw, she lifted herself from despair and clumsily maneuvered her newfound metallic body. Climbing over debris and broken pillars, she returned to the place where she had engaged in a fierce fight with Pompeii—the Pilgrimage.

        After crossing the severed metal plates, Shamash arrived at a vast and circular open space surrounded by metallic walls. With no visible ceiling in sight, the space seemed to be endless.

        “Mother is right here, and I will find her!” Shamash closed her eyes and mustered her power to sense the hidden presence below. After a moment, she detected the energy fluctuations of her target. With a leap, she landed in the center of the open space, where a faint seam on the ground emitted a subtle golden light.

        “I’ve found you… Mother, just hold on a second. I will release you soon. Shamash’s face lit up with joy as she channeled her power to unleash a series of attacks on the seam.”

        Before she exhausted all her power, she managed to create an opening half the size of her body, revealing a portion of a massive radiant sphere lurking within.

        “I did it… I know I’m the chosen one, the one to be revered by all, and to have her name live in the annals of history…”  Shamash approached the opening with excitement, reaching out to touch the exposed part of the radiant sphere. Howere, a murky and profound purple mist suddenly billowed from behind and swiftly enveloped her hands. Then, snap—

        —Shamash’s hands were forcefully snapped off by the purple mist.

        “ARGHHH—!” Shamash screamed in agony, but her cries did not stop the mist’s destruction. After consuming Shamash’s hands, the mist continued to surge upward until it completely engulfed her body.

        “Destroy… Annihilate… Devour…” A transcendent voice came from the purple mist, like a ghostly whisper, yet similar to the sound of explosion of a newborn star, containing the truths of the universe and everything.

        “No… No! Don’t! Don’t devour me! Ahhhh—” Following the purple mist, an overpowering influx of information swept through Shamash’s body and soul, planting an indescribable terror into every fiber of her being, pushing her further into the depths of madness.

        “It’s terrifying, too terrifying! I have to escape. I must escape! Or I’ll be consumed completely, with nothing left!” Shamash tapped into her instinct for survival, using every ounce of her strength to twist her body regardless of possible injury. The only idea remained in her mind was the urge to flee.

        Shamash could barely comprehend how she managed to break free. Relying solely on her instinct, she ran outward and reached the entrance of the Mech City. Joy briefly appeared on her face as she caught sight of the flickering flames outside the city. However, her expression quickly froze—she found that something seemed to be pulling her back, preventing her from moving forward.

        “Why can’t I move?” Shamash lowered her gaze only to notice something strange. “Wait… Weren’t my hands snapped off just now? How did they regenerate… No! What happened to my legs? Why have they turned into a pile of rusted metal?”

        Bending down, Shamash widened her eyes in disbelief as she discovered that her lower body no longer existed, or more precisely, it had fused with the Mech City.

        “So, I never truly escaped that terrifying power just now… No, it can’t be! I’m one of the glorious Eldus, and this shouldn’t happen to me!” Shamash raised her head proudly, an inexplicable confidence filling her mechanized face. She declared loudly, “All of this is face! I didn’t become a hideous machina; Mother didn’t devour me; and I didn’t become a part of the Mech City… Yeah, all of this is a dream. It’s just a long nightmare…. Ahahahahaha!”

        As Shamash spoke, she burst into a raucous and piercing laughter that carried a hint of twisted and vicious madness accompanied by despair, and it continued to echo in the depths of the sealed underground city...</p>
