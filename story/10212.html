        One day, the Star Flower suddenly emerged from the inside of its star, blossoming on the surface. Having perceived humans as a threat to its star, the Star Flower took defensive measures and created Noman, a being of destruction.
Noman released a star serum which transformed into a miasma toxic to the human body. The humans were forced to take shelter in areas with low miasma levels or mobile fortresses.
Even faced with the possibility of extinction, the humans were divided into two opposing campsâ€”the United Government that wanted to destroy the Star Flower, and the anti-government group Easter that searched for another way.
During this strife, Neo was born as the next step forward for humanity, boasting a constitution that was resistant to the miasma and that could receive signals from the Star Flower.</p>
