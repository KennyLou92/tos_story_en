        <h1>Emperor's Agony - Xiang Yu</h1>
        <p>
                While Xiang Yu leaned against the temple wall, blood kept streaming from the wound on his abdomen, creating blossoms of crimson on the ground. Despite his heavy eyelids, he still stared straight ahead with deep affection and lingering tenderness in his eyes since it was the direction that Yu Miaoyi, the love of his life, left not long ago.

        “Miaoyi, please forget me and live a happy life.”

        Finally, Xiang Yu closed his eyes as his strength faded, waiting for his death in peace. However, his peace was soon disturbed by the sound of soft footsteps. Although Xiang Yu faintly knew that someone stopped in front of him, he no longer had the strength to open his eyes so he could only let his mind slowly slip into the darkness.

        It was some days later that Xiang Yu finally regained consciousness. The terrible pain in his abdomen drew his brows into a frown. Then he found himself lying on a strange yet comfortable bed, and his wounds were properly bandaged.

        “I’m still alive… Who saved me?”

        ‘Someone is finally awake.’ A tall figure came to his bed along with a husky female voice.

        ‘You’re… the queen of the Western Empire… What do you want?’ asked Xiang Yu with all his guard up since he knew clearly that the Queen would never save him for free.

        However, the Queen’s answer was beyond his expectation——

        ‘Find Miaoyi and take her away as far as possible,’ said the Queen who did not look at him but kept fiddling with the broken metal mask in her hands. The Queen had sent someone to the temple to retrieve the mask since it once belonged to Yu Miaoyi.

        ‘...Why?’

        ‘Yeah, why… Prince of the Eastern Empire, there isn’t a single moment when I don’t think of killing you with my own hands… But Miaoyi… Haoyue adopted her and she is my only sister now.’ Even though the Queen sounded exactly the same as usual, Xiang Yu could tell the great weariness and deep grief from her half-closed eyes.

        Years ago, the Western Queen proactively negotiated with the Eastern Empire so as to put an end to the chain of wars. As the relationship between the two empires had finally improved, she sent her own little sister, Haoyue, to the Easter Empire as an emissary to negotiate a truce. Little did she know that her sister would return in a coffin.

        Even though there was an unresolved mystery about Haoyue’s death, the Queen was blinded by hatred, and taking vengeance on the Eastern Empire had become her only wish ever since until she witnessed Xiang Yu and Yu Miaoyi trying to kill each other. Only then did the Queen realize that Yu Miaoyi had been living in such grave agony and despair that she would rather sacrifice her life for love.

        In a state of shock, the Queen could not take a step but only watched Panhe take Yu Miaoyi away. Consumed with a dreadful sense of guilt, she was too ashamed to see Yu Miaoyi. Still, there was a silver lining—she finally rose out of hatred and saved Xiang Yu from the verge of death.

        ‘I want nothing but her happiness and you’re the one who can make her happy. So, in return for saving your life, I want you to find Miaoyi, love her and protect her for the rest of your life.’

        Instead of saying yes, Xiang Yu remained silent. He knew that all it took was a single nod for him to get his wish and live a peaceful life with Yu Miaoyi away from the flames of wars that had been torturing him for life. However, he also knew that it would not be true happiness for both of them.

        ‘I’m sorry but I’m not going.’ Lifting his head, Xiang Yu turned down the Queen’s offer with anguish, despite how much he longed to see her again. Even though it broke his heart to pass up this opportunity, he knew he had to do it. With the radiance of determination shimmering in his eyes, he said, ‘As long as the war between the East and the West doesn’t end, Miaoyi and I can never live happily without the guilt over our people and repentance for our sins.’

        ‘That’s some fine-sounding talk. Actually, ending the war is easy. All you need to do is kill your father and I will wipe out the Eastern Empire. But you won’t do it, will you?’ The Queen sneered at Xiang Yu.

        ‘I won’t do that. It’s nothing but a massacre. Besides, it will only benefit the wolves behind no matter which empire wins. I bet you’ve noticed, your Majesty. Back then, we were just one step away from establishing peace, but your sister’s death happened to come in the way. It was just like someone wanted us to keep fighting. Was her death really just a coincidence, or someone’s scheme?’

        ‘You’re smarter than I thought. I didn’t think you could see through the hidden truth.’ The Queen showed no sign of surprise as if she had known. Indeed, the Queen knew of the conspiracy just as Xiang Yu suggested.

        ‘Your Majesty, let’s join forces. Together we can find out the mastermind behind all the flames and smoke.’ Xiang Yu turned his gaze to the Queen, his face filled with awe-inspiring righteousness and conviction.

        ‘...Sigh, you and Miaoyi truly make a silly couple. Both of you chose a difficult path. Do you understand what is waiting for you ahead?’ The Queen looked back at Xiang Yu with pity.

        Xiang Yu lowered his eyes. He knew that he would possibly have to wield his sword at his brothers and people if he worked with the Queen and disguised himself as one of the Western Empire subjects. Even just the thought of that made his body ache. Even though guilt and repentance swept over him like a tidal wave, still, he straightened his back and looked at the Queen unswervingly.

        ‘Yes, I know, but I have to bear these sins for Miaoyi and for my homeland so that the innocent will not have to suffer anymore.’

        ‘...Since you insist, let me give you a hand then.’ The Queen gave Xiang Yu her promise.

        From that day on, Xiang Yu put on Yu Miaoyi’s mask and dressed as a western soldier while carrying out an investigation secretly.

        In a collaborative effort, the two finally found the mastermind behind everything—the Qin Empire. The Qin Empire had been sowing discord between the two countries so as to wear down their national power and annex both of them once and for all.

        Even though the Queen and Xiang Yu figured out the truth, they felt powerless facing reality. Given the implacable animosity between the two nations, the people would not believe them even if they reveal the truth. For such a reason, they had to come up with the next step.

        ‘Your Majesty, only by joining forces with the Eastern Empire and exposing Qin’s scheme can we talk our people out of the deep-rooted hatred.’

        ‘But I don’t think your father will say yes to your plan.’

        ‘I will make him.’

        ‘You aren’t going to——’

        ‘I will sneak into the Eastern palace and meet my father to convince him.’ Taking a deep breath, Xiang Yu made up his mind and said, ‘If that doesn’t work, I will take the crown myself.’

        In the middle of that night, Xiang Yu successfully sneaked into the palace of the Eastern Empire and arrived at the Emperor’s bedroom door. When he was pondering how to distract the guards, he heard a familiar voice shouting, ‘Don’t expect me to open the door for you! Just get the hell in!’

        Xiang Yu knew that the Emperor had noticed him so he took off his mask and walked into the room. It had been a long time since the last time he saw his father. To his astonishment, the Emperor’s hair had turned white as if he had aged for decades in Xiang Yu’s absence.

        Looking at his aging father, Xiang Yu spoke with mixed feelings, ‘Father——’

        ‘I’m not your father. I lost my son the moment you defected to the Western Empire!’ With his face reddening in rage, the Emperor unsheathed his sword and made a slash at Xiang Yu, who did not move an inch to dodge the attack. Instead of cutting into Xiang Yu’s body, the sword stopped in front of his chest.

        ‘Why?! Why didn’t you avoid my sword?’

        ‘Why should I avoid it when I have nothing to hide?’ Unwaveringly, Xiang Yu looked at the Emperor. He seemed to be the one with the upper hand despite that the Emperor was the one holding a sword to his chest.

        ‘Father, my wish has never changed. All I ever wanted was to put a stop to the war between the two nations so that no more innocent lives will be lost.’

        ‘So your best solution was to turn your back on your homeland?!’ shouted the Emperor furiously.

        Xiang Yu did not flinch at the Emperor’s wrath but shook his head with pity and said, ‘Father, the Western Empire was never our enemy. Our true enemy is Qin, the empire far away.’

        ‘...Do you have any proof?’ The Emperor's Face slightly brightened. Still, he was dubious about what Xiang Yu said.

        Xiang Yu stepped forward and put some scrolls and evidence on the desk in front of the Emperor, who immediately opened them and started reading. The more he read, the more he sulked. Eventually, he could not help but hurl the scrolls onto the ground.

        ‘Very Well! Those ungrateful ministers! How dare they secretly work for Qin while taking the people’s money! What a disgrace to our empire!’ Trembling with rage, the Emperor felt short of breath. Xiang Yu immediately stepped forward to hold his body and pat his back to calm him down.

        ‘Father, calm down.’

        ‘I… am fine.’ As soon as the Emperor caught his breath, he said emotionally, ‘My son, you’ve done a great job. I knew that you would never turn your back on our people. But what should we do now? It is impossible to talk our people out of their hatred toward the Western Empire with solely this documentary evidence…’

        ‘I have a plan, but I need your help, father.’ And so, Xiang Yu told the Emperor his plan. After sitting silent for a while, the Emperor breathed a sigh and held Xiang Yu’s hand. He made up his mind and said, ‘Okay, I believe in you.’

        In the next few months, there had been several reports of the Eastern Empire’s defeat and casualties, and the Western Empire took the initiative to declare the final war.

        Wearing a mask, the general of the Western Empire came to the gate of the Eastern Empire palace and stood against the enemy troops. In a full suit of armor, the Eastern Emperor steered his horse to the front. Pointing his sword to the western general, he shouted aloud, ‘You have intruded on my land and made my people suffer! In response to your contemptible gesture, I hereby declare war! So come at me if you dare!’

        Instead of answering the Emperor, the general steered his horse and raised his sword to fight. It was a neck-and-neck fight, but soon the Eastern Emperor lost his strength—which made sense given his age—and fell off his horse under the general’s blow. His helmet fell into the general’s hand, who held it up to claim his victory. 

        Bang!

        Just then, a loud dull noise and a pungent smell of gunpowder came from the forest nearby and swept through the western general. Fortunately, the general was vigilant enough to dodge the first sneak attack. Still, he and his troops could not escape the siege of an army armed with muskets. 

        ‘Ha, nice move. But you and your weary army are no match for our soldiers,’ said Emperor Qin, who rode his horse to the forefront of his army. With his lips curling up into a triumphant smirk, he looked down at Xiang Yu and said, ‘I can spare your life if you surrender and declare your allegiance to Qin now.’

        ‘You finally came. I’ve been waiting for you, Emperor Qin.’ Unexpectedly, it was not the general who answered Emperor Qin but the Eastern Emperor, who should have been defeated. As soon as he got back on his horse, he blew a loud whistle with his two fingers.

        The next moment, a troop of soldiers rushed out of the Easter Empire palace and surrounded the Qin army. Riding a white horse, an exquisite woman came to the front of the army and said, ‘Ha, got you!’

        Knowing that he had been set up, the Emperor stared at the masked general and asked bitterly, ‘Who the hell are you?! How did you talk both the emperors into helping you?’

        ‘Because we all want the same thing—peace.’ Xiang Yu took off his mask and revealed his chiseled face. His true identity surprised Emperor Qin.

        ‘You are… Xiang Yu… I thought you were dead.’

        ‘Yes, I was dead, but I came back from hell to expose your scheme!’

        Raising his sword, Xiang Yu pointed it at the emperor of Qin, his eyes filled with burning anger and resentment. Then he shouted loudly, ‘I am Xiang Yu, the prince of the Eastern Empire, and the general of the West Empire! The emperor of Qin is a despicable man! He has sent spies to spread scandalous rumors and create discord between the two empires over the years, lurking in the dark, hoping to take advantage of our wars! And so, I talked to the Western Queen and the Eastern Emperor, and together we set up a trap. His presence is the best proof! Listen to me! Emperor Qin is the man who has ruined your families and destroyed your homes! He is the one that started the endless wars between the two empires! He and his people are our true enemies!’

        ‘Soldiers of the East! Hear me! Follow the prince and wipe out the Qin army!’ the Eastern Emperor roared, raising his sword up in the air.

        ‘Soldiers of the West! Hear me! Follow the general and wipe out the Qin army!’ shouted the  Western Queen with a fierce swing of her sword.

        The two armies, who had been fighting to the death over the years, finally made their first step toward concord. At Xiang Yu’s command, the two armies surrounded the forest where the Qin army stood.

        Seeing that the table had turned, Emperor Qin decisively ordered a retreat and fled under the protection of his elite cavalry. Xiang Yu saw and promptly steered his horse to catch him.

        “I’m only a step away… I can expose Emperor Qin’s scheme as soon as I catch him, thus the wars between the two empires will finally come to an end. Miaoyi and I can finally have our dream come true!”

        The excitement of having his dream at his fingertips took the best of Xiang Yu and blinded him from the risk of chasing after his enemies alone. That was why he failed to react when he saw Emperor Qin lift the musket in his hand. It was a few seconds later that he felt excruciating pain in his left chest. Blood seeped out of his armor, staining his clothes red.

        Xiang Yu, who was shot, could not continue riding his horse but watched Emperor Qin and his cavalry recede into the distance. A great sense of powerlessness swept over him. He stretched his arms in desperation only to break his balance and fall off the horse. It took several rolls to break his fall.

        By then, the night had fallen and the stars were strangely bright, just like the night he and Yu Miaoyi met. As much as he wanted to stand up, the excessive loss of blood sapped his strength and pulled him back to the ground. The overwhelming sense of resentment and regret burned his eyes.

        “Why… Our dream finally came true… We can finally walk on the street as a couple… But why did it end up like this… Is this the price for killing too many people?”

        His breath became weaker. Right before the moment that his mind fell into sheer darkness, he whispered softly, ‘Miaoyi… I love you…’

        A scorching tear dribbled from his right eye and fell into the puddle of blood underneath his body…
