        <h1>Fate Meltdown - Kagutsuchi</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Yamato - Ch.5

        Drowning in the darkness, Kagutsuchi experienced non-stop flashbacks——energy outburst in childhood, energy outburst in adulthood, estranging Izanagi...The past he loathed but he couldn’t get away with.

        “My existence achieves nothing but hurt others...Maybe this is my perfect ending...This is the way to keep me from hurting people...and keep me from harms…”

        The utterly hopeless Kagutsuchi locked himself up, but he didn’t know that he was battling Susanoo under Tsukuyomi’s control in the real world. At this moment, Kagutsuchi was holding his sword with his body on fire. Susanoo, too late to shield himself with the water element, let go of his sword because of the scorching pain. Seizing the chance, Kagutsuchi threw Susanoo’s sword away.

        All of a sudden, Amaterasu screamed! Looking over worriedly, Susanoo saw the wounded Amaterasu being restrained by Tsukuyomi with her threads.

        “Amaterasu!”

        Susanoo’s rescuing intention was predicted by Tsukuyomi, who flicked her finger. Next second, Kagutsuchi stepped up and subdued Susanoo!

        “Dang! Let me go, Kagutsuchi!”

        In the darkness, Kagutsuchi heard Susanoo’s call. Slightly opening his eyes, he saw Amaterasu in danger while he had Susanoo subdued.

        “Amaterasu!”

        “It’s useless. You cannot defy fate. You, who was born because of the black magic, should not exist at all. The world doesn’t need you,” a female voice whispered to him.

        Kagutsuchi's heart was defeated again. All he had ever wanted was to protect the others, but all he had done was hurting them…

        “Don’t give up!”

        Susanoo spoke loudly, “you’re just avoiding the problem! You can protect no one at all! YOU COWARD!”

        Susanoo surged his spiritual energy to blast Kagutsuchi away. Next second, he punched Kagutsuchi hard on his face. 

        “Wake the hell up! Kagutsuchi you idiot!”

        Susanoo then pulled Kagutsuchi close by dragging his collar. 

        “Amaterasu never gives up on you...She has been waiting for your return! Is this how bad you wanna protect her? Is that it!?”

        All of a sudden, Susanoo was immobilized, for Tsukuyomi restrained him with her energy threads while he was occupied by the battle. Exhausted, he couldn’t break free this time.

        In the meantime, Kagutsuchi opened his eyes again in the darkness, and the female shade appeared again.

        “Your return only causes sufferings, and you’ll suffer too. Just give up.”

        “Indeed, the people around me were hurt by my untamed spiritual energy, but…”

        Kagutsuchi regained his courage to defy his fate when he thought of the smile of his beloved one.

        “Someone’s waiting for my return!”

        A flame sword appeared in his hand, but the fire was warm this time. Then he wielded the weapon to banish the female shade, freeing Kagutsuchi’s  consciousness from the infinite darkness——
