        <h1>Winry Rockbell</h1>
        <p>
        Ed and Al's childhood friend, and the mechanic for Ed's automail. 

A jovial girl who is always bright and cheerful around the brothers and doesn't show any grief despite losing her parents in the civil war of Ishval. 

She is what you call a "mechanical otaku" - a sucker for anything related to automails. When Ed breaks his automail, her wrench comes flying right away. 

She understands the Elric brothers more than anyone else and is honing her skills as an automail mechanic every day in order to support the brothers on their journey to regain their original bodies.
