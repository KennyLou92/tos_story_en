        <h1>Quacky Conclusion - Conan Doyle</h1>
        <p>        One day in the kingdom of Verdilles, located in the western Tarones, a piercing scream shattered the peaceful morning air.

        A noblewoman, overcome with fear at the sight before her, forgot all her decorum and collapsed to the ground. 

        Not far from her lay the lifeless body of a small dog, sprawled amidst the grass. Its delicate frame was now torn and eviscerated, its blood forming a pool on the ground which tainted its collar, filling the air with a sickening stench.

        The noblewoman who recognized the collar realized the tragedy that had befallen her beloved pet. Overwhelmed with grief, she burst into tears, moaning, “No, my Baby, I can’t believe someone took you away from me like this.”

        Her cries drew a crowd. People whispered into each other’s ears, talking about the gruesome incident, unaware that a plump white call duck had waddled over, eavesdropping on their conversations.

        “Sigh, another pet murder.”
        “This is the third victim this week.”
        “Oh… How brutal.”

        Just then, a man dressed in fine attire approached the noblewoman, extending a hand in a gesture of comfort. His handsome face showed concern as he spoke gently, “My condolences, Madam. I have already contacted the authorities, and detectives will soon arrive to investigate.”

        “...Count Walden!” The noblewoman, soothed by the Count’s presence, regained her composure. She took his hand as she stood up and said, “Thank you.”

        “You’re most welcome. Helping those in need is something everyone would do,” the Count said. His chivalrous and refined demeanor elicited looks of admiration from the crowd, except for the duck who displayed a look of disdain as if it detected a lingering stench.

        “Count Walden is indeed the kindest gentleman in Verdilles; he’s done quite a number of good deeds in the past six months since inheriting the title.”
“Yes, I heard he donated funds to build the latest pet hospital in town.”
“And he’s taken in numerous stray cats and dogs. Truly a remarkable man.”

        Through the praising crowd, a timid female detective timidly walked to the center of the scene. Her name was Annika, a rookie detective. She asked the Count and the noblewoman in a hushed tone, “Excuse me, are you the one who reported the incident?”

        “Yes! Miss detective, you must find the person who killed my Baby!” The noblewoman grabbed Annika’s hand, shaking it so vigorously that it almost made Annika dizzy.

        “Ye-yes… Madam…I will help you, but please stop shaking me like that.”

        “Madam, perhaps you should release the detective’s hand for a moment,” Count Walden advised, and the noblewoman let go of Annika’s hand.

        After letting out a sigh of relief, Annika picked up her notebook and turned to the noblewoman. In a professional manner, she asked, “Please tell me what happened.”

        “This morning, I went out for a walk with my Baby as usual. We then stopped at a restaurant for breakfast. Pets weren’t allowed in the restaurant, so I tied Baby to a lamppost outside. After I finished my breakfast, I found that Baby’s leash had been untied. I thought she had wandered off, so I searched everywhere, and there I found her in this thicket… Oh, my poor Baby!” The noblewoman’s voice broke as she talked about her beloved pet’s unfortunate demise.

        Annika continued to ask the noblewoman questions. Afterward, she searched the scene thoroughly but found no substantial clues. The Count, visibly displeased by her fruitless effort, said with a rare frown, “There have been multiple pet murder cases for the past few months. Yet, the police have not made a single progress, which is unacceptable. If there’s no breakthrough by the end of this week, I’m afraid I’ll have to report your incompetence to the King.”

        After leaving those words, the Count turned to leave only to discover a white little fluff ball—the white duck that had been pacing around the scene. The duck, with its head held high, met the Count’s gaze with its black little eyes. Its adorable appearance melted the Count’s heart. He bent down to touch it, but it evaded his hand and ran to Annika’s back.

        “Is this your pet?” The Count’s eyes lit up with a strange hint of excitement, his face slightly twisted as if he was suppressing some urge.

        “No,” Annika replied, lifting the duck, which did not resist, an indication that it might be domesticated. “It seems to be lost. I’ll take it back to the station and make a report.”

         “...Very well. Mark my words,” the Count left with an enigmatic smile after taking one last glance at the duck.

        Contrary to the carefree Count, Annika felt a heavy weight on her shoulders. Still, she had work to do so she began to make her way back to the police station while holding the duck in her arms.

        “Sigh, how are we gonna find the murderer by the end of this week? …If only someone could just tell me the answer,” Annika muttered to herself with a sigh.

        “I know who the murderer is, quack,” a voice that resembled one produced by a voice changer suddenly sounded.

        “I knew it couldn’t be that easy… W-who is it?” Annika looked around, but no one was in sight. She instinctively held the duck closer as fear gripped her heart.

        “Quack, you fool! Loosen your arms, I can’t breathe!”

        “Eek!” It was then that Annika finally realized that it was the duck in her arms speaking. She frantically threw it away like dropping a hot potato. To her surprise, the duck remained extremely calm. It did a flip in mid-air and landed safely on a nearby box half her height. It even began tidying its ruffled feathers.

        Annika nervously looked at the duck and cautiously asked, “Mr... Mr. Duck?”

        “I’m not a duck, quack! I’m Conan Doyle! A phantocauda!”

        “Um... You’re quite different from the phantocaudas I know…”

        “I only ended up in this form because I got put under a curse, quack,” Conan Doyle flapped his wings. “Anyway, enough about me. Let’s talk about the murderer you’re looking for, quack.”

        “So you really know who the murderer is?” 

        “Of course, quack.”

        “Then who is it?” Annika eagerly asked.

        “Isn’t it rather audacious to seek the answer without proffering a quid pro quo, quack?”

        “Uh… Mr. Conan Doyle, what do you want in exchange then?”

        “I want that!” Conan Doyle pointed his wing to a store at the end of the street. Annika looked over and fell silent for a moment before asking, “...You want buttered corn?”

        “Yes, quack! I want that golden, sweet corn slathered with rich butter which melts from the heat and seeps into each plump kernel, creating a miraculous texture…”

        “Um… It does sound delicious.”

        “Not delicious, quack! It’s extraordinary!” Conan Doyle crossed his wings, drooling over the buttery corn. Then he abruptly opened his eyes wide and stared at Annika as he demanded, “I want three ears of buttered corn! Three ears of buttered corn and I’ll tell you who the murderer is!”

        “No problem,” Annika promised, thumping her thin chest. She swiftly ran to the store and bought three ears of freshly baked buttered corn. Before she stopped her steps, a dark shadow rushed past and snatched one ear of steaming corn, devouring it like a gust of wind.

        In no time, Conan Doyle devoured all three ears of corn. After he wiped his mouth clean, he said haughtily, “The Count did it.”

        “Ah, I see… Wait, WHAT?” Annika’s jaw dropped in astonishment. “How could that be? Count Walden is a renowned philanthropist known for his love of animals. You must be mistaken!”

        “You ignorant girl, you have been deceived by his false facade, quack. I, Conan Doyle, am never wrong when it comes to solving a crime. I detected a strong scent of blood underneath his perfume, which I guess he put on to mask the scent. I also noticed bloodstains on the inside of his trousers as I approached him earlier, clearly a careless mistake during his crime.”

        “But he could say that he got the scent and bloodstains from comforting the noblewoman earlier. I’m afraid we can’t apprehend him without the most compelling and irrefutable evidence, especially given his esteemed reputation as a Count.”

        “Well, in that case, let’s create it on our own, quack!” Conan Doyle grinned broadly.

        Several days later, Annika strolled through the park with Conan Doyle, who now wore a floral collar, as they awaited their prey. As they expected, the impeccably dressed Count Walden appeared moments later. Spotting Annika with Conan Doyle cradled in her arms, he approached and inquired, “Isn’t this the duck from the scene days before? Why are you holding him?”

        “I posted a lost notice that day, but no one came to claim him, so I assumed he had been abandoned. Seeing how cute he is, I decided to take him in, and he has been a lovely companion since.”

        “Quack!” Conan Doyle flapped his wings in agreement.

        “Indeed, he is lovely. I have never seen such a beautiful duck before. I really want to—” The Count abruptly stopped himself from spilling his true desire. He then continued awkwardly, “to pat it. Unfortunately, I have quite a busy schedule today, so perhaps next time.”

        “You’re always welcome, Count Walden.” After bidding a warm farewell to the Count, Annika set Conan Doyle down to play on the ground while she sat on a bench. She soon drifted off to sleep, perhaps due to exhaustion or the pleasant warmth of the morning sun.

        While she was sleeping soundly, someone stealthily approached and quietly crept closer to Conan Doyle, who was leisurely strolling on the grass. He swiftly stooped down and scooped up Conan Doyle before hurriedly running to a secluded and deserted alley away from the park.


        “Ah, finally, I’ve caught you,” the man revealed himself as Count Walden. He lifted Conan Doyle high into the air, his face bearing a look of crazed infatuation

        “I’ve had the urge to stain your perfectly white feathers with blood from the moment I saw you. Only then can you be liberated from your suffering.”

        Count Walden took a sharp dagger out of his coat. With excitement gleaming in his eyes, he gazed at Conan Doyle placed atop a barrel and whispered, “Only by doing so can I find fulfillment, so obediently succumb to my power!”

        “I refused to succumb to a pervert like you, quack!”

        “What… You can speak… You two tricked me!” Count Walden, who realized that he had been set up, immediately turned to escape.

        “Humph! Not a chance!” Conan Doyle summoned his power, unleashing a tremendous force that shattered the curse’s shackles and transformed into his true form—a three-tailed phantocauda.

        With a swift pounce, Conan Doyle tackled the fleeing Count Walden, pinning him down with his right claw. He raised his head and called out, “Hey! Clumsy girl! I can only stay in this form for five minutes! The murderer will escape if you don’t show up now!”

        “We are here!” Annika emerged from the shadows with several officers and swiftly handcuffed Count Walden.

        “Count Walden, you are under arrest for being responsible for multiple cases of animal cruelty. Please come with us for interrogation.”

        “Dammit… You wretched peasants, on what grounds do you arrest me? I will report you all to the King!” The Count, his true colors exposed, discarded his philanthropic facade and snarled menacingly at the officers.

        “You’re under arrest because you’ve committed a crime!” Despite the Count’s threats, Annika stood firm and declared, “Take him away!” 

        And so, the officers took Count Walden away. Annika then walked toward Conan Doyle, who had reverted to his duck form due to his curse, and thanked him with a respectful bow.

        “Thank you so much. We couldn’t have caught the murderer without your help!”

        “I don’t need your thanks, quack.”

        “I know. You want more buttered corn, right? I’ll go get it now!” Annika hurried off. Left alone,  Conan Doyle gazed in the direction of the palace, his small black eyes filled with unwavering determination.

        “It’s almost the day of the invitation. No matter what, I must find the Holy Grail to reverse the curse upon me, quack!”</p>
