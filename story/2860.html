        <h1>Deception of Hope - Pandora</h1>
        <p>
                It was a bright morning when the sun shone brilliantly over the great lake that shimmered with the reflection of the vibrant blooming flowers nearby. Suddenly, a young man came and broke the tranquility, gasping for breath as he ran from afar. His eyes swiftly scanned the horizon until they landed on a peculiar rhombus crystal levitating by the lake, radiating a dazzling light.

        As the young man came to a halt in front of the rhombus crystal, he spent a moment to catch his breath. It was after he meticulously fixed his disheveled hair, ensuring his appearance was flawless, that he reached out and touched the rhombus crystal which unleashed a blinding white light and engulfed him in an instant.

        In the next second, the young man found himself standing in front of a beautiful cottage. In the cottage’s courtyard was an exquisite woman dressed in a flowing gown sitting at a small table,  gracefully sipping a cup of tea. As she noticed the young man’s arrival, she put down her cup and approached him, her face wearing a gentle and affectionate smile.

        “Billy, you came,” said the woman named Pandora. Furrowing her brows slightly, she asked with a hint of playfulness, “Why is your head covered in sweat? Did you run here? Didn’t I tell you not to rush?”

        Pandora took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the sweat from Billy’s forehead. As the young man’s gaze fell upon the woman’s captivating face and his nose took in her alluring fragrance, he became momentarily entranced, recalling the first time they met.

        Billy was the youngest son of a wealthy merchant in a prosperous town in the North. Despite being favored and privileged since childhood, he never wanted to follow in his father’s footsteps in running a business. Instead, he aspired to become a soldier on the front lines, defending humans against the constant onslaught of demons.

        However, his father disapproved of his aspiration, which led to a heated argument between the two. In a fit of rage, Billy stormed out of his home and ran into the forest outside the town, not knowing that a group of demons lurked nearby. Just as he was about to be surrounded by the demons, a golden bird appeared and guided him to the rhombus crystal—a magical portal that connected to a fantasyland where he eluded the enemies and met Pandora.

        Back then, Pandora approached him—just like the very moment—and tended to his wounds tenderly. Her kindness captivated him entirely. Later, he learned from Pandora that she was cursed and trapped inside the magical box, unable to return to the mortal realm.

        Of course, it was difficult for a young man like Billy to see a beautiful woman suffer, so he promised to free Pandora from the box. He also began to visit the magical realm in the box frequently to spare her from loneliness.

        “What’s wrong? Did you exhaust yourself during the run? That’s why I always tell you not to rush.” Pandora’s words brought Billy out of his reverie. As he regained his composure, he looked at Pandora, who was wiping the sweat off his forehead so attentively. His heart inevitably fluttered, and he could not help but say with deep affection, “Because I was afraid to keep you waiting for too long.”

        “I’m fine with waiting. I’m trapped here, after all. I have nothing else to do but wait,” Pandora said with a hint of sorrow in her voice, accompanied by a slight tug at the corners of her mouth.

        Seeing the melancholic look on her face, Billy felt a twinge in his heart. He firmly held Pandora’s hands and said with determination, “I will definitely free you out of this box! I’ve already planted your seeds around the town.”

        “You’re my hero,” Pandora said softly as she leaned into Billy’s embrace. She then whispered sweetly, “Thank you.”

        “No, it’s nothing at all,” Billy replied, putting his arms around Pandora. With a hesitant look on his face, he asked, “But is that all?”

        “Well, for now, all we need to do is wait for the night of the full moon. My curse will be lifted as soon as you bring the rhombus crystal into the town,” said Pandora, raising her head. With her captivating and alluring gaze constantly tugging at Billy’s will, she added, “And then, we can be together.”

        “...That’s good to hear.” Billy, bewitched by Pandora, suppressed his doubts and succumbed to the intimate entanglement with the exquisite woman. It was only when the sun set that Billy reluctantly left the magical realm, leaving Pandora alone.

        As soon as Billy’s figure disappeared, the tenderness and sweetness on Pandora’s face faded away, replaced by a cold, haughty expression. Unable to hide her jubilation, she said, “Men are truly stupid. They think of themselves as the savior as long as a woman pretends to be weak and adds a few sweet words. Little do they know they are nothing but easily manipulated fools…”

        Pandora looked up at the void above her head, a radiantly wicked smile spreading across her face. With her sinister intentions hidden within her voice, she shouted, “Oh, the box of hope, soon I will devour your power. Then I can return to the mortal realm without passively waiting for people to make wishes or losing my hatred for Loki. And then, I will torture him to death with my own hands... Ahahaha!”

        The thought of the coming glorious future filled Pandora with excitement. She could not help but burst into hysterical laughter with her hands on her face, her voice echoing throughout the magical realm…

❊

        Finally, it was the night of the full moon. Billy walked toward the center of the town with the rhombus crystal, as he had promised.

        “Billy, this is far enough,” Pandora said.

        “Okay, I'll let go then.” As Billy opened his palm, the rhombus crystal rose gently into the air and began to spin, reflecting a radiant halo under the moonlight. Eventually, the halo transformed into the figure of Pandora.

        “Pandora!” Billy shouted out Pandora’s name in excitement as it was the first time he saw her in the real world. He rushed toward her with joy only to find that his body passed through her. He turned back in astonishment and asked, “Wh-why?”

        “It’s because my curse hasn’t been completely lifted; something is still missing.” The translucent Pandora covered her mouth with a hand. She playfully stuck out her tongue and lightly licked her crimson lips. Her strangely flirtatious demeanor was nothing Billy had seen before, which gave him a sense of fear for a moment. But he soon pushed the feeling aside and anxiously asked, “What is it? I’ll get it for you!”

        “No need, because I’ve already found it,” Pandora replied with an unusually sweet smile that yet had a chilling undertone.

        “Huh? What are you talking about— Woah!” Vines suddenly sprouted from the ground, binding Billy and causing him to cry out in surprise. But what terrified him most were the countless screams and cries emerging from all corners of the town.

        “Pandora, what... what have you done?”

        “I simply broke free from the box’s restraints, using your life and the lives of the people in this town,” Pandora said, her chin resting on a hand. She tilted her head to the right, displaying the coquettish pose Billy used to love. But now, it only filled him with fear. 

        “So, you lied to me…” Billy strenuously lifted his head, his face was filled with sadness. He said, “So, you never liked me…”

        “Yeah, why would I like a fool like you?” Pandora said, her tone filled with disdain.

        “Ha... hahaha!” Billy laughed through the pain in his heart. With tears streaming down his face, he said, “Yes, you’re right—I am a fool! A miserable who believed you! But you’re even more miserable than I am, Pandora.”

        “What are you talking about? How could I be more miserable than a dying foolish man like you?” asked Pandora, her face darkened, displeased.

        “At least I have a family who truly loves me, but no one will ever love a wicked woman like you! And you’ll spend the rest of your life begging for someone’s—”

        With a loud snap, the vines, under Pandora’s control, strangled Billy. His blood splattered onto the ground. However, Pandora’s raging fury remained unquenched even after ruthlessly taking the man’s life. Clenching her fists tightly, she nervously bit her lower lip.

        “No! How would no one love me? No way!” Pandora vehemently denied Billy’s words. She raised her hands high, and a dark purple glow converged from all corners of the town, forming a massive vortex of power. Taking aim at the levitating box, she forcefully hurled it.

        “As soon as I consume the power of the box, I will be invincible! I will get all my wishes, and Loki will beg for my mercy and love me! I will become the happiest woman in the world!”

        As the two immense forces collided, a blinding light appeared, illuminating the town as bright as day.

        Crack! Unable to withstand the colliding force, the box emitted a cracking sound. Pandora’s face lit up with joy, and she fervently poured more power into it.

        “Look, everything is going according to my plan... Wait! What... The box is going to self-destruct and take me down with it... No! NOOO!”

        The moment the box shattered, the overflowing power rushed towards Pandora, engulfing her completely. She had no choice but to summon her remaining strength to protect herself. Still, she was propelled by the force of the box of hope, crashing into a wall and losing consciousness.

        It was not until the dawn’s rays shone once again that Pandora regained consciousness. She looked around in confusion, her eyes roaming around the unfamiliar surroundings.

        “Where… Where am I… No… Who am I… I.. I can’t remember anything… I need to ask someone… find someone…” In confusion, Pandora struggled to get up from the ground. She then dragged her weary body away from the town, in search of the memories she had lost...</p>
