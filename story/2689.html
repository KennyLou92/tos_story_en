        <h1>Harmonic of Purification - Feiyin</h1>
        <p>
        Feiyin the Featherette looks cold but has a warm heart. Despite her introvert, she’s a sentimental person.
With her liking for music of humans, she’s good at chinese zither.
Feiyin was rescued by Kasuga Sen, the former queen of Yamatai, when she was drowned at her young age. Since then, she had become the spirit beast for Yamatai in return for the queen’s kindness. As a guardian of Himiko, the two are closely related.</p>
