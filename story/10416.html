        <h1>Battle-crazed Swordswoman - Jubei Yagyu </h1>
        <p>A citizen of Tōwa Teito who comes from a long line of katana-wielders. 
She murdered a well-known katana-wielder and all his disciples to take back her family sword—Muramasa the wicked katana. After retrieving the sword, she started hunting strong fighters across different races’ territories and caused many casualties which put her on the wanted list of the Heptara Unies.

She has a rather extreme and relentless personality. She is willing to do anything to get stronger, even if it means losing her eyes.
Belligerent by nature, she takes great pleasure in fights against the strong ones.</p>
