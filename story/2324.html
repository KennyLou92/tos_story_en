        <h1>Relentless Effort - Donald</h1>
        <p>
        One night in a circus tent, Donald the elephant was coaching a group of young elephants, who hadn’t rested for 3 consecutive days.

“HURRY UP!”

The loud order from Donald startled all presenting young elephants to line up as fast as they could.

“Get ready!” Donald gazed at the neatly elephants, who held the breaths out of nervousness.

“Water!” Donald instructed.

“Pluff pluff…” Few elephants raised their long noses to eject coloured water into the air. In a blink of an eye, the stage became colourful with festive vibe.

“Speed up the pace and splash more water!”

The young elephants sped up their moves, moving their short thick legs faster

“Bad! This is bad! Performance like this is not appealing at all,” Donald criticized, shaking his head with a glare. When the young elephants were all frightened by his feedback, their moves started to become disrupted.

“Stop! Everyone STOP!”

Donald trampled the ground hard, making a noticeable earthquake. As the frightened elephants became even more nervous, they stacked together with a knot tied by their noses.

“What a failure! This is disastrous! How can you present this to the audience! Everyone is staying here for extra practice. Those who fail to keep up won’t get any food and sleep until my approval!” Donald yelled at them.

The harder the young elephants struggled, the tighter their noses were tied together. While they started to have difficulty in breathing, Donald never paid them any sympathy.

“Ah...I can’t breathe,” said one of the young elephants, who decided to quit the practice. When he ran towards the exit, he accidentally dragged all the others away because of the knot.

“How dare they leave with such an excuse! 100 more sets of practice tomorrow!” All Donald wanted was getting the upcoming performance ready as soon as possible.

Yet an unexpected plot twist happened few days later──the ringmaster fired them.

“Sir, we can practice restlessly. We won’t let you down!” Donald asked for a second chance agitatedly.

The ringmaster shook his head and said, “Donald, it’s not effort that you’re lacking.”

The ringmaster left after giving Donald a complicated glance.

“It must be my coaching method. I was not tough enough. I need to change the ringmaster’s mind. Elephants! Come over and start practicing right now!”

Since then, Donald had been pushing at the young elephants for tougher practice, while Donald himself was dived into even more practice for all days and nights.

“No...It’s not enough. I need to do more sets...Huh? Why is everything spinning…”

During a late night practice, Donald first had a spinning sight then fainted.

Having been unconscious for a long while, Donald found himself lying on his bed when he opened his eyes. He struggled to get up as he first thought popped up, “practice...I need to practice!”

What was happening outside the window stopped him from leaving. At this moment, one of the young elephants said, “Donald said that we must raise our nose to this angle to make a high splash! Everyone keep your effort up!”

“Keep it up! We can do it!” Every elephant succeeded once they followed the instruction.

“So it is encouragement that can make them do better?”

At this moment, a young elephant let out a long yawn, and he apologized immediately as if he would be scolded next second, “I’m sorry Donald!”

“It’s okay. Donald is still resting. We haven’t had some sleep for long too. Ohm…” another elephant said.

The rest of the elephants started yawning as if it was contagious. Then they burst into laughter after exchanging a gaze.

“Have they been so afraid of me in this whole time?” Donald questioned himself.

By making a cough, Donald notified the young elephants that he was awake. As soon as the young elephants heard it, they stopped laughing.

“Don’t worry Donald! We’ve been practicing all this time!” All the young elephants gathered around him and said. Donald didn’t notice the bandages on them until now.

“So they’re all injured?” Guilty conscience filled his heart.

“Donald, we almost finish the new performing trick! Let us show you now!” A young elephant came forward and said.

“All elephants stop practicing!” Donald commanded.

“Donald, are you giving up on us?”

All elephants were freaked out as they had never heard such an order from Donald.

“No. I should thank all of you for not quitting. I never praised your effort. All I did was criticizing, which is the only thing that drag you down. I know you all have been paying great effort.”

“Donald...We...Boohoo…” The young elephants burst into tears as they were eventually recognised by Donald.

“I have faith in you guys. Please have faith in me too,” said Donald, hugging all the young elephants.

“Sure! We have faith in you too!”

Few months later, an adult elephant led a group of young elephants to the entrance of a circus.


“My boys, are you ready?” Donald asked as he raised the recruitment flyer at the young elephants, who nodded in high spirits.

“Let’s go then!”
