        <h1>Zhurong</h1>
        <p>
                “Rong, you’re a sleeping beast.  Your awakening will be the doom of this world.”  In a blurry dream, a young lady sincerely smiled but what she spoke right afterwards did not match her pleasant expression.  “You’ll bring infinite death and disaster to the world.”
        “Sister, I——” Zhurong’s words were disrupted by a sudden shake.  She woke up from the dream and saw Meng Huo looking worried.  Her head ached as she only had two hours of sleep everyday from dealing with all kinds of things.
        “We’ll arrive soon.  The carriage just entered the tribe.” Meng Huo gently touched Zhurong's face and asked: “You look pale.  You should rest more.”
        Looking at her husband, Meng Huo, Zhurong could feel his affection and care towards her.
        “Why does he still love me even though I've taken advantage of him?” 
        The bumpy ride interrupted her train of thought.  Meng Huo immediately protected Zhurong by hugging her tight.  As the ride steadied, a groom reported: “Someone is lying on the ground.”
        Meng Huo looked outside and found a man lying flat.  He then jumped off the carriage and helped the man up; the man who had his eyes and mouth wide open with snot and saliva all over his face said: “Haha...I’m...very...very happy…”
        “Are you okay?” Meng Huo anxiously asked, but Zhurong answered him instead, saying: “it’s useless talking to him.  Look at the people around us.”
        Meng Huo looked around the tribe.  Most people were either sitting or lying on the ground.  Just like the man, they were all confused.  The presence of Meng Huo and Zhurong had drawn their attention, and they harbored malice against the two of them.
        “Get in the carriage.  Otherwise, they'll swarm towards us.” Zhurong calmly said.  Meng Huo had no choice but put the man aside.  He wondered what had happened here, but was distracted by Zhurong.
        “Let’s get through this tonight.”
        The two of them remained silent until the carriage arrived at a magnificent stone castle——the place where the tribal chief of Nanman resided.  After a series of rituals, Meng Huo succeeded the position of tribal chief and headed to his room with Zhurong.
        Meng Huo could no longer contain his impatience and asked: “Dear, what’s going on exactly?”
        “In order to obtain overwhelming military power, our brother has borrowed some of Cao Cao's soldiers from Wei, provided that this tribe tributes a certain amount of ecstatic poppies each quarter.”
        “Ecstatic poppy...What is it?”
        “It’s a special plant.  Ignite the leaves, and the fumes will hypnotize the users, bring them into euphoria and finally get them addicted to this plant.  No other grain will be planted within three years if the people choose to grow these poppies instead.” 
        “So...those people we met were all users of  ecstatic poppies.” Meng Huo shouted in disbelief: “Our country will perish if this situation continues!  Why would my brother agree to this absurd condition?
        “Why...It's because humans get what they want, whether it's by fair means or foul.”
        “I can't stand by and do nothing as my country dies.  Is there any way to save our people?” Meng Huo anxiously paced back and forth; Zhurong grinned as she saw the vexed look of him.
        “He is on the hook.  What a simple-minded man.”
        “Yes, but I need your help.” Zhurong embraced Meng Huo and whispered in his ear: “You’ll no longer be yourself.”
        “...As long as you need me, I’m willing to do anything for you.” Meng Huo closed his eyes and held her tight, dedicating his body and soul to her.
        The next day at noon, a hundred cavalry led by Cao Cao and war elephants led by Meng Huo had a face-off on the border of Nanman.  Xiahou Dun spoke on Cao Cao’s behalf: “Tribal chief of Nanman, you did not tribute the ecstatic poppies before the deadline.  According to our agreement, we shall confiscate your castle as a compensation!”
        “Humph!  I’ve never signed an agreement with a rat.” Meng Huo spat as he swung his weapon, acting like a total hothead.
        “We have the written agreement on hand.  Denial won't help you.” Xiahou Dun opened the parchment and showed the emblem of Nanman.
        “That signature isn't mine, but this scum's.” Meng Huo signalled his underling to bring a man, whose hands and legs were tied, in front of him——the man full of scald wounds was Meng Huo’s brother, the former tribal chief.  Meng Huo's brother begged for mercy: “Cao Cao...help...help me…”
        “He violated your agreement.  In that case, I’ll make it up to you with his life!” Meng Huo bristled up and cut off his brother’s head in front of the crowd.  He expressed no care for the blood spilling on him and threw the severed head in front of Cao Cao. He then grinned and said: “Now that the signatory is dead, the agreement is no longer valid.  Go back to your dog house!”
        “You——!” Xiahou Dun was too angry to speak, so she glared at Meng Huo instead.
        “You want a fight?  Bring it on!” Meng Huo whistled and a sudden burst of fire appeared on the ground.  A fire beast taller than three meters was conjured, who bared its teeth at Xiahou Dun, which frightened her.
        “What kind of magic is this?”
        The conjuror of the fire beast was not Meng Huo, but actually Zhurong.  It was a special innate ability she possessed, but Xiahou Dun was unaware of this.
        “...Let’s retreat.” Cao Cao suddenly ordered; Xiahou Dun then asked in confusion: “Master Cao Cao, may I ask why?”
        “Haven't you noticed that this is an ambush?”
        Meng Huo was not relieved until Cao Cao and his army were out of sight.  He looked back to look at Zhurong who had a content smile on her face.
        “Great!  I’m happy as long as she is happy…”</p>
