        <h1>Mousike of the Sun - Cassandra</h1>
        <p>        Even since Apollo had taken back Cassandra’s prophetic powers, he never showed himself to her again. Losing her ability to dream the future, Cassandra could only feel a numbing void in her heart that grew bigger day by day. One night, the elements brought Cassandra a vision in her deep slumber…

        ‘Your Highness, I really need this lead dancer position…’ said the female dancer with sobs who knelt before Cassandra. Pursing her lips, Cassandra did not say a word.

        Cassandra knew that the dancer was betrothed to a magnate who was said to have beaten a maid to death. The dancer was terrified, yet the only way out of this betrothal was for her to become the priestess of the God of the Sun, and only by becoming the lead dancer could she get the god’s attention.

        As much as Cassandra wanted to be the lead dancer in the rite to get the blessings from Apollo and become his priestess, she felt the dancer’s desperation. Slowly loosening her clenched fists, she thought to herself, ‘All I have to lose is just a chance to be his priestess, but what she is losing is her whole life.’

        ‘Please stop crying, or else your beauty will be blemished by your puffy eyes when you lead the dance,’ Cassandra said softly, her eyes filled with love and compassion.

        Knowing that Cassandra had agreed to help her, the dancer immediately prostrated herself before the princess with water brimming in her eyes.

        On the day of the rite in admiration of Apollo, Cassandra, the princess of Troy was absent because of sickness while the dancer got her wishes and became the priestess of the God of the Sun.

        Sitting at the bay window in a dim room, Cassandra looked at the temple that was ablaze with lights. A feeling of loss quietly crept up in her heart. Hearing the music outside the window, she could not help but begin dancing alone in the room, only to be discovered by her mother who suddenly pushed open the door.

        Instead of asking Cassandra why she feigned her illness, Cassandra’s mother took her to a masquerade ball, hoping to cheer her up.

        Everyone at the ball was required to wear a mask. However, the crowd of aristocrats somehow only left Cassandra breathless so she went to the garden outside the hall with her mask on instead.

        Cassandra looked up at the moon in the sky. Suddenly, she heard the sound of heavy breathing. Then she was shoved to the ground. Her mask fell off; her knees scraped on the ground which caused a burning pain.

        She turned around, only to find a flushed drunk man lying on her back. As she took a closer look, she recognized that the man was the prince of the neighboring kingdom.

        ‘Hehe, pretty… You’re pretty… Let’s play…’

        ‘Your Highness, please show some respect to yourself and let go of me!’

        ‘So you’re Princess Cassandra, right? I’ll just ask my father to put in a word and make you my wife. That should solve the problem,’ said the prince unashamedly while putting his lips close to Cassandra’s skin. Just as Cassandra was in the depths of despair, a ray of strong light brightened the gloom in the garden and turned into a ball of light that blasted the prince away.

        ‘What a hideous piece of garbage, get out of my sight!’

        It only took one glance for Cassandra to recognize the beautiful man who descended from the air. His dazzling face took her breath away and brought a ray of sunshine to her heart.

        ‘God of the Sun…’ Cassandra immediately prostrated herself before Apollo. Finding Cassandra’s voice familiar, Apollo slowly walked toward her.

        ‘Look up and let me see your face.’ At Apollo’s words, Cassandra slightly lifted her head and looked at him. He immediately recognized those sparkling eyes that had not changed a bit over the years.

        “It’s her?” Apollo recalled that he had once disguised himself as an old ugly man while manipulating demonic beasts to fake an attack in a village so as to test the nature of humans. 

        He thought that no human would put their lives at risk to give him a hand, but a little girl proved him wrong and protected him regardless of her own safety. Now that kind and selfless girl had grown into a beautiful woman, and it tickled Apollo’s heart.

        “Who knows my spontaneous decision of coming to the human ball would lead to a reconnection with the past… Perhaps it’s destiny.” Apollo thought to himself introspectively while extending a hand to Cassandra.

        ‘Cassandra, the princess of Troy, I am here to keep my promise to you. From now on, I shall light up your path, and you shall serve by my side and be my woman.’

        A radiant smile spread across Cassandra’s face. She replied with great respect and sincerity, ‘Dear God, thank you for the gift. It is the highest honor for me to receive such a blessing, to be the priestess of God of the Sun.

        At first, Apollo was stunned by Cassandra’s innocent answer, but he soon let out a sigh of compromise. ‘Well, so be it then.’

        No matter what choice Cassandra made, her unwavering faith would always lead her to the God of the Sun and make her a part of his fate.

        “As the most loyal believer of the God of the Sun, I shall dedicate myself to the people and hold my faith in my Lord’s blessings.”</p>
