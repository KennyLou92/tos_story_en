        <h1>Desireless Path - Ximen Qing</h1>
        <p>        In a remote small kingdom in the Eastern Tarones, all the farmers were busy with the fall harvest to send their crops to the town’s market. The Ximen family was no exception as they rose before dawn to engage in their agricultural duties.

        However, on this particular day, the man of the house fell ill, so he sent his son, Ximen Qing, to venture alone with the freshly harvested produce to sell in town. Despite feeling a bit overwhelmed, Ximen Qing managed to sell every single item of produce, returning home with coins jingling in his pockets and an empty wooden cart.

        When Ximen Qing passed by a narrow alley, he heard a stifled cry of pain coming from somewhere nearby. Fearing someone was in trouble, he hurriedly set aside the wooden cart and ran into the alley. There, he witnessed a man ruthlessly dragging a woman by her hair. With her knees on the ground, the woman’s right cheek was marred by a fiery handprint while blood trickled from the corner of her mouth, looking pitiful and disheveled.

        Anger surged within Ximen Qing instantly as he beheld such a distressing sight. He yelled at the man, “Let her go!”

        The man initially flinched and hunched his shoulders at Ximen Qing’s loud shout. However, a slight sense of relief washed over him as he looked up and found that it was a young lad who had yet to reach adulthood. And so, he angrily retorted, “Kid, mind your own business and get lost!” 

        “No!” Instead of showing any signs of fear, Ximen Qing stepped forward and declared, “I can’t stand idly by, watching a poor woman falling victim to your violence!”

        “Tut!” The man spat contemptuously, and said, “She is my wife, and I am the young master of the Shang family! She belongs to me! What’s wrong with me teaching her a lesson?”

        Ximen Qing was momentarily stunned by the man’s answer before his indignation deepened and quickly surfaced. His fair face creased into a fierce frown, and he pursed his lips as he said, “Nonsense! You should be protecting your wife, not hurting her!”

        “What a nosy kid! This is my family matter, and it has nothing to do with a little brat like you. So, beat it before I teach you a lesson too!” The young master raised his fist, brandishing it threateningly at Ximen Qing.

        “You should leave us alone… Just go…” the woman pleaded with a mournful tone, not wanting to involve an innocent bystander. However, her words did not quell Ximen Qing’s anger. Instead, they fueled his exasperation and frustration which turned into a brazen display as he defiantly stared at the man and retorted, “I am certainly better than a coward who only knows how to treat women with violence!”

        “You— It seems like I have to teach you a hard lesson to remind you who you are dealing with!” The young master lunged toward Ximen Qing, but his movement was rather clumsy and sluggish for his inexperience in physical exertion. His attempt was feeble at best, compared to the young Ximen Qing, who had spent years laboring and honing his physique in the fields.

        Ximen Qing easily seized the young master, bending his right hand backward and pressing it against his body. The young master let out a piercing scream as he felt an acute pain. “Ow ow ow! It hurts… My hand… It’s broken!”

        “Why are you screaming in pain? Your wife experienced much more pain when you struck her!” Ximen Qing’s voice remained stern, showing no signs of mercy. 

        “I was wrong! Young hero, I was wrong! Please spare me!” Seeing the unforgiving Ximen Qing, the young master quickly wore a fawning smile and pleaded, “How about I let you sleep with my wife once? You’re so young, you must not have tasted the pleasures of flesh yet. Although she’s not particularly attractive, she can still satisfy your... ARGH!”

        The young master’s words were abruptly interrupted as Ximen Qing viciously struck him, causing him to scream with blood and a few teeth spilling out. Ximen Qing’s face was filled with frigid rage, radiating an overwhelming aura of menace that even caused the woman on the side to tremble involuntarily.

        “A despicable beast like you doesn’t deserve to live,” Ximen Qing enunciated each word with clarity. His voice was calm and deep but it carried an undeniable sense of oppression, leaving the young master so terrified that he wet himself. Nevertheless, his embarrassing situation failed to stop Ximen Qing’s actions.

        Ximen Qing raised his fist and repeatedly pounded the young master’s body, eliciting a few howls of pain for a brief moment. But soon, the young master could only weakly emit muffled groans. The scent of blood permeated the alley, still, it failed to snap Ximen Qing out of the unusual pleasure he was experiencing.

        “How gratifying this is!  Smashing everything that displeases me to pieces…”

        Dong!

        Suddenly, a resonant and profound sound of the singing bowl resounded, sending shivers through Ximen Qing’s entire body. His heart pounded so rapidly as if he had awoken from a nightmare in the middle of the night.

        It was only then that he realized that his hands had been stained with crimson and the man beneath him was barely breathing. He looked up in confusion at the Zen master who had just struck the singing bowl. His eyes met with the Zen master’s calm and clear eyes which seemed like a tranquil lake that quieted Ximen Qing’s restless inner turmoil.

        “Mr. Ximen, please don’t get entangled with obsessive thoughts,” the Zen master advised calmly as he walked over to the fallen young master. He whispered powerful sutras to treat the young master’s injuries. However, the young master seemed to have been quite frightened. He scrambled and ran away before the Zen master finished the treatment. His wife followed him, leaving Ximen Qing and the Zen master alone.

        “Mr. Ximen, your desire seems to have overwhelmed you and it leaves you prone to violence. You may bring calamity upon yourself. Please restrain yourself before it is too late,” the Zen master said.

        “I-I didn’t mean it. I only did it because that man, the young master, was abusing his wife—” Before Ximen Qing could finish explaining, the Zen master shook his head. With his inscrutable eyes filled with a tint of pity that Ximen Qing could not fathom, he continued, “The words have been spoken. Enlightenment is an individual pursuit. Let us part ways here.”

        While Ximen Qing watched as the Zen master receded into the distance, a sense of resentment and frustration welled up in his heart. He thought, “It was the young master! I have done nothing wrong, and I don’t regret what I did!”

        However, the Zen master’s prophecy soon came true.

        One day, the Ximen family had dinner and retired to bed one by one after completing their daily farming. Ximen Qing fell into a deep sleep as soon as he lay down. Suddenly, he felt the temperature increase and heard someone calling out to him, “Qing’er, wake up!”

        “Mmm… Cough, cough!” Ximen Qing woke up and opened his eyes only to find the room filled with smoke, causing him to cough incessantly.

        “Don’t inhale the smoke. Our house is on fire and we need to go now!” urged Ximen Qing’s father who helped him up and handed him a damp cloth.

        “What about Mother and Sister? Have they already escaped?” Ximen Qing asked.

        “They’re waiting for us outside!” Ximen Qing’s father answered after a moment of hesitation. Relieved, Ximen Qing placed the damp cloth over his mouth and nose, following his father out of his room and into the living room which had been engulfed in flames. The stifling heat hindered their progress at every step. Yet, the most unbearable part was the billowing smoke in the room which nearly suffocated Ximen Qing. Fortunately, after much effort, they managed to overcome the flames and reach the front door.

        Ximen Qing rushed forward to push open the door, but the intense heat had warped the door, causing it to get stuck. Gritting his teeth, Ximen Qing forcefully slammed his shoulder into the door. After several attempts, he finally succeeded in crashing through the door. However, due to the impact, the weakened beam above collapsed, just about to crush Ximen Qing— 

        Bang!

        In that dire moment, Ximen Qing’s father summoned a surge of brute strength and forcefully propelled his son out of harm’s way. The next instant, the beam, engulfed in flames, crashed down on his father.

        “Father!” Ximen Qing scrambled to his feet and rushed back to rescue his father, but it was too late. The house, unable to withstand the prolonged inferno, gave way after the beam fell, rumbling and collapsing in a cloud of dust and debris.

        “Why… Why did this happen… Why…” Ximen Qing kept muttering upon witnessing his father’s unfortunate demise without knowing that an even more harrowing fact awaited him.

        He frantically searched the surroundings, but his mother and sister—who were said to have escaped from the fire—were nowhere to be found. It was not until after the fire was extinguished that he discovered them amidst the ruins—two charred corpses, apart from his father.

        Only then did Ximen Qing realize that his father had concealed the deaths of his mother and sister to ensure his escape. Still, the agony of being the sole survivor was too much for him to take.


        He kneeled before the three lifeless bodies, tears streaming down his face, unable to comprehend how an ordinary yet contented life could be shattered in a single night.

        However, despite his anguish and despair, time continued to pass. Afterward, Ximen Qing gathered himself and arranged funerals for his family. At the funeral, Ximen Qing impassively nodded as his neighbors offered words of condolences. He was still deeply immersed in the pain of losing his loved ones until he overheard a whispered conversation among the neighbors—

        “What a calamity that befell the family...”
        “Sigh, unfortunately, it wasn’t a natural disaster.”
        “Huh? What do you mean?”
        “Last night, when I went to the bathroom, I saw the guards from the Shang family’s house walking over from the direction of the Ximen family. They even gave me a menacing look when they spotted me. I was so scared that I hurriedly went back to my house, wondering what they were up to...”

        Ximen Qing paid no heed to the neighbors’ remarks, as he was consumed by searing anger and hatred. There was only one thought in his mind.

        “I will kill him! The Shang family… It was that despicable young master who orchestrated the arson. He killed my parents and my sister. It was him… I won’t let him get away with this! I will make him pay, tearing him limb from limb!”

        The moment Ximen Qing learned that the one who destroyed his family was none other than the young master he had confronted a few days prior, his overwhelming sorrow and despair fueled his savage instincts and ignited a potent desire for revenge. Armed with a woodcutter’s knife, he ventured alone into the young master’s residence. After bypassing the guards’ resistance, he slew the young master with his hand. Little did he know that the young master’s ten-year-old son witnessed his gory revenge.

        Filled with resentment, the boy grabbed a guard’s sword and swung it at Ximen Qing, his anger mirroring his own. Caught off guard by the familiar fury reflected in the boy’s eyes, Ximen Qing failed to react in time and was struck in the waist. The pain compelled him to flee instinctively. Clutching his bleeding wound, he escaped the young master’s house and ran into the dense forest before he finally succumbed to excessive blood loss and collapsed, losing consciousness completely.

        When Ximen Qing woke up again, he found himself in an abandoned temple on a mountaintop. His wounds had been tended to and properly bandaged. Before a crackling fire was a man tending to a clay pot suspended over the flames. A delicate fragrance of herbs wafted from the pot, indicating that the man was preparing the medicinal concoction Ximen Qing needed.

        “He is... the Zen master I met before!” Ximen Qing recognized the face of the person— the Zen master who had admonished him. As he observed the Zen master’s serene and untainted presence, an overwhelming sense of resentment surged within him—he resented the master for telling the prophecy, and for pointing out the filth of his sins. The twisted sense of animosity slowly consumed his being, giving birth to an abhorrent malice.

        With murderous intent, the wounded Ximen Qing stood up and approached the Zen master from behind. Then, with a sudden lunge, he tackled the master to the ground, gripping his neck tightly with both hands. The veins on his hands bulged with exertion.

        “It’s all because of you! If you hadn’t stopped me back then, I would have killed that scumbag. And then, my parents and my sister wouldn’t have perished in that fire. My family would have lived happily together! It’s all your fault!”

        “...Even if you had…killed him, his parents and his friends…would seek vengeance against you… Everything is dependently originated, so nothing is permanent. The principle of karmic cause and consequences remains unchanging throughout eternity…”

        “Ha! So you’re saying I was wrong for standing against domestic violence?” Ximen Qing laughed furiously, tightening his grip around the Zen master’s neck whose bones emitted a brittle cracking sound under the pressure. “All the Zen teachings you’ve learned are nonsense! Since I have already stained my hands with blood, I don’t mind taking another life!”

        “...If…my death…could redeem you, then I…willingly accept it,” whispered the Zen master who remained tranquil despite being held in a vulnerable position. His partially lowered eyes carried a sense of forgiving pity that shook Ximen Qing’s hatred.

        Under the Zen master’s serene gaze, Ximen Qing felt exposed. All his despicable acts, all his brutality, were laid bare in the air. He felt ashamed, and guilty, engulfed by an unprecedented sense of weakness.

        And then, he regretted his actions.

        Ximen Qing released his grip on the Zen master’s neck. Helplessly falling to his knees, he murmured like a child, “Why... How could you harbor no hatred, no anger… You saved me, yet I blamed you for something that wasn't your fault and even tried to kill you in a fit of rage. Why did you still show mercy toward me…?”

        Ximen Qing kept murmuring while tears streamed down his eyes, leaving dark stains on the Zen master’s robe, like the suffering endured by every sentient being in the mortal world.

        “Because you were seeking my help. You were in greater pain than I could imagine. How could I blame a good man burdened with guilt?” the Zen master answered.

        “A good man?” Ximen Qing gave a scornful chuckle at the Zen master’s words, raising his head in self-derision. “I just killed someone. There’s still blood on my hands. Why would you call someone like me a good man?”

        “Your intentions are pure, but you have grown too attached to obsessive thoughts,” said the Zen master. He stood up and continued, “You’re too attached to the illusion of absolute purity and too obsessed with justice, yet you have grasped none of their essences.”

        “...Is it wrong to pursue a world of purity and justice?” Ximen Qing pondered, raising a question with a hint of confusion. The Zen master replied with a gentle smile, “My child, sentient beings in the mortal realm are filled with desires, seeking to manifest their intentions. Our desires and aversions are like fire. When you try to eradicate evil with greed and anger, it is merely fighting fire with fire. Ultimately, no lives would be saved; instead, it only gives rise to more desires and aversions.”

        The Zen master’s words reminded Ximen Qing of the young master’s child who witnessed his father’s death. The despair and hatred on the boy’s face mirrored Ximen Qing’s own resentment when he first learned that the young master had slaughtered his family. It was the feeling of empathy that prevented Ximen Qing from evading the boy’s attack. It was then he found that the guilt of hurting an innocent child was more unbearable than the physical pain inflicted upon him.

        “Then, Master... What should I do?” Ximen Qing asked earnestly.

        “Sever your desires, renounce love, and recognize the source of your mind. Immerse yourself in the profound principles of Buddha and awaken the unconditional Dharma,” said the Zen master gazing at Ximen Qing, his eyes profound and emanating a gentle brilliance that comforted the broken soul before him. “Only by abandoning your desires and aversion can your mind find peace and your soul comprehend the great path.”

        The Zen master’s teaching stirred Ximen Qing’s mind, starting a tremendous wave within him for a long while. It was not until Ximen Qing subdued his inner turmoil that he prostrated himself respectfully to the Zen master with his knees on the ground, “Master, I wish to follow you and humbly ask for your guidance.”

        The Zen master granted Ximen Qing’s request. He took him back to the Zen sect and formally accepted him as a disciple, bestowing upon him the name “Wu Yu”, which meant desireless.</p>
