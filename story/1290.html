        <h1>Lü Bu</h1>
        <p>        Lü Bu had destroyed countless lives. Some were men of justice. Consequently, Yuanshi Tianzun could not ignore Lu Bu’s sins. Yuanshi Tianzun had decided to punish Lü Bu, Tongtian Jiaozhu pleaded for him…
 
        ’Tianzun, please let him go.’
 
        ’You know that’s not possible.’ said Yuanshi Tianzun.
 
        ’I’d sacrifice my life for him!’ Tongtian Jiaozhu raised his Divine Brush and thrust it at his head, only to be blocked by Taishang Laojun. Despite the persuasions from many celestial gods, Tongtian Jiaozhu insisted on granting Lü Bu mercy. Consequently, Yuanshi Tianzun let the impartial Taishang Laojun decide Lü Bu’s fate.
 
        Lü Bu had killed the innocent, as well as the guilty. As impartial as Taishang Laojun was, it was difficult to weigh Lü Bu’s deeds. Taishang Laojun decided to give Lü Bu another chance. He untied him from the celestial ropes and challenged him to a fight. They would forgive him if he won. But Lü Bu’s pride could not accept their pity or mercy. He cried to the heavens and ended his own life.
 
        Lü Bu was a demon. Death was not his final destination. He could devour souls to recreate his body. Yuanshi Tianzun intended to evaporate his soul, but Taishang Laojun thought that would be too severe. Tongtian Jiaozhu asked for permission to take care of Lü Bu’s soul by making him his servant.
 
        ’Brother, leave if you want. I won’t stop you.’ said Tongtian Jiaozhu.
 
        'Hearty is gone. There’s nothing worth living for in the world. Plus I don’t want to put you in a tough spot.’ replied  Lü Bu calmly.
 
        The passage of time did not add any furrows to their faces. Tongtian Jiaozhu observed the changes in the realm from above. Lü Bu followed suit. There was a vast land in the realm. Ever since a man called Cao Cao ruled the land, heroes had risen up one after another to fight for domination. The wars reignited Lü Bu’s urge to fight. It kept tingling his soul. Spectating could no longer satisfy him. Tongtian Jiaozhu was well aware of these changes…
 
        ’Deafening wails have filled the realm, but as a celestial god I cannot intervene in their world easily.’ sighed Tongtian Jiaozhu.
 
        ’Send me down to save them from suffering. It’s an opportunity for me to pay my debt.’
 
        Lü Bu’s eyes were full of remorse. Tongtian Jiaozhu was glad to hear his request. He secretly browsed books about reincarnation behind Taijun and Taishang Laojun’s backs. Finally, he found a spell that could “revive” Lü Bu.
 
        Tongtian Jiaozhu brought Lü Bu to a creek in the jungle. The silence there was in stark contrast with the chaotic wars outside. A male corpse lay next to the river. Tongtian Jiaozhu incanted spells around it using the Divine Brush. A strong force pulled Lü Bu into the body…
 
        He opened his eyes. Dazzling rays of sunlight shined upon him. He could feel gravity as he sat up. It was the evidence and burden of “living”.
 
        ’Need a hand?’ Tongtian Jiaozhu’s voice came from above.
 
        ’I’m Lü Bu. I don’t ever ask for help.’ Lü Bu got on his feet.
 
        He strode and stretched his limbs. He was finally reborn as a human. He could not wait to confront the heroes thriving in this troubled time…</p>
