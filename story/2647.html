        <h1>Rosalind the Revenant</h1>
        <p>
        Rosalind hates the mafia with a burning passion. The Cobras had persecuted her parents, but spared and adopted her because of her talents. Watching Carlo Gaminbo slowly topple over on the monitor, Rosalind took off her hood to reveal her smile. She sauntered out of the mansion while the Lucianos and the Runemaster watched warily. "That day I went to the future, he understood my loathing; he changed me, smiled, and told me what to do... Now I'm coming back..." she said as she took a gun out from behind her. "Now that the cobra is dead, the wraiths too must meet their end!"</p>
