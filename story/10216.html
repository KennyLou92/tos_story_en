        <h1>Elusive Thief Arsene: Phantom Mode</h1>
        <p>Phantom City is a cybercity filled with skyscrapers. Many call this city home, be they human, beast, android, magician, or the thief named Arsene. When she was a child, Arsene's parents were murdered, and she herself was nearly killed, but the incident awakened her magical powers and gave her the ability to transform the greedy desires of humans into jewels.
One night in Phantom City, Arsene confronted Mayor Justice to take back the happiness of the city's people. She ended the battle by calling forth L'Aiguille Creuse to illuminate the mayor in a barrage of lights, and from the mayor's shadow emerged his desires in the form of a phantom. Arsene finished the phantom using her magical power, transforming it into jewels.</p>
