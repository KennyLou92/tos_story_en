        <h1>Spraypaint of Dream - Chloe</h1>
        <p>
                A petite figure was dashing along a dusky street. Although she was wanted by multiple white spot lights, they caught nothing but merely spooky white walls. Taking a turn into an alley, the figure opened a sewage lid and leapt into the hole.

        Under the lid, there was no noxious sewage but a spacious basement. Inside which, a group of nervous people were packing their belongings. Chloe, the petite figure who was chasen earlier, was adjusting her breathing pace after the exhausting run. Meanwhile, a man came over to talk to Chloe.

        “Chloe, were you hunted by the guards again?

        “Yes, but don’t worry. They didn’t know that I am here,” said Chloe while refilling her spray paints.

        “Stop messing around. Leave the town with us tomorrow,” the man said seriously, and he continued, “you’ll eventually get caught like your parents did if you live on like this…”

        “That’s why I do it. I do it for them!” Going from calm to angitated, Chloe spoke out her mature thoughts with her childish voice, “everything has changed ever since the beginning of the dictatorship. I just want this town to go back to what it was.”

        Chloe’s words had put the man into silence.

        Chloe lived in a town renowned for street arts, where the people recorded their livelihoods with wall paintings. When the people were satisfied, the paintings would be warm and lively; when they were sad, the paintings would be cold and gloomy.

        However, the walls of this town were all painted white now, erasing the colourful footprints of the people. This happened because a dictator had taken over this town.

        When the people expressed their disappointment towards the dictator on the walls, the paintings would be covered up with white paints by the guards. Worst still, the painters would be arrested for subversion. 

        As time went by, only the paintings that flattered the dictator were kept on the walls. The people had lost their freedom of speech and creation.

        “What can you do on your own? Plus you’re too young…” The man sighed.

        “I ain’t alone! There are so many people here waiting for a chance to overthrow the dictatorship like us!” The agitated Chloe continued with a spray paint in her hand, “there are so many anti-dictatorship marks left in the west art district!”

        “Then do you know that the guards have arrested a bunch of people at the west side? We’ve found a train that leaves the town tomorrow. Everyone has decided to leave. Just think it through,” said the man, shaking his head. He went back to pack his stuff after the conversation.

        “Why is everybody giving up...Damn it!” Pissed off by their attitude, Chloe gritted her teeth and left the hideout alone.

        It made her even angrier when she saw the censored walls on the street.

        “Ssssss——!”

        Chloe was spraying anti-government slogans on the wall; then she added some childish doodles on the paintings that flattered the dictator.

        “Haha. Your doodles are cute!” A voice of a boy spoke next to Chloe.

        “Who?”

        Startled, Chloe saw a boy smile at the paintings, who held a spray paint in his hand just like Chloe.

        “But I think it’ll take more to express our feelings,” said the boy, and he sprayed a poop logo on the dictator’s head, making the portrait funnier.

        “Haha. Does it look good on him?”

        Chloe nodded with a smile.

        “Who’s there!”

        All of a sudden, a few strands of white light appeared at the street corner, followed by few muscular men.

        “The guards! Run!”

        Exchanging a gaze, Chloe and the boy turned around to flee immediately. Before they could run to the opposite side, they spotted other strands of white lights at the end of the street.

        “This way!”

        Chloe dragged the boy into an alley while the shouts behind became closer and closer. The two had been running across the alleys, but all exits were blocked by the guards. Very soon ,Chloe realized that they had been surrounded.

        “That’s a dead end!”

        Chloe failed to notice a dead end ahead as she was focusing on the pursuing guards behind them. By the time the boy warned her, it was too late to stop their feet, bumping right into the wall.

        “Are we gonna get caught...Huh?” Chloe opened her eyes slowly as she couldn’t feel the anticipated pain. Meanwhile, the guards with white flash lights appeared at the intersection. 

        “This is a dead end. Where the hell are they? Just ignore the paintings. Find those two people first!”

        “They can’t see us…” Chloe realized that all the guards couldn’t sense their presence. She didn’t move her body until they had gone. When she moved, she accidentally tripped herself together with the boy, stumbling in front of a wall.

        “That was strange…” The boy was shocked.

        “We were hiding in the painting,” said Chloe. When she reached the painting, her hand became a part of it.

        “Haha. Then we don’t need to worry about getting caught from now on,” said the boy, but nothing had happened when he did the same thing.

        “Strange though. Seems like this is your ability…” The boy could only enter the painting if he held Chloe’s hand.

        “Let’s put it aside. Where are we…” 

        Chloe found that they were at the other side of the dead end, where they saw a magnificent train.

        “I heard that a train would leave the town tomorrow. This should be the train,” said the boy indifferently.

        Unlike the boy, Chloe’s eyes glittered when she heard his words. She picked up the spray paint and said, “let’s show everyone the art of this town!”

        Surprised at first, the boy eventually got what Chloe meant as he saw her approach the train. With a loud laughter, he then joined Chloe’s great creative project.

        Next day, a train went out of the town slowly, accompanied by the raging yell of the dictator and the hopeful exclamation of the people. Doodles about revolutions were painted all over the train, while there was an eye-catching slogan on the car.

        “Tyrannical dictatorship eventually ends; people’s voice is everywhere to be heard.”

        At this moment, Chloe and the boy were watching the train leave on a rooftop. Meanwhile, the boy spoke to Chloe, “let’s go. Few people arrived by following the marks on the paintings. They said they would like to join us.”

        With a nod, Chloe left with the boy while having a thought in her head, “people’s voice will be heard someday as long as it doesn’t stop.”

        Chloe gathered a group of people who shared the same faith in the town. Their paintings were everywhere to be found in the town, spreading the message to the others. Gradually, a rebel force was formed. All they needed was a chance to overthrow the tyranny...
