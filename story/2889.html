        <h1>Nordic Remembrance - Skogul</h1>
        <p>        In the northern realm, there was a kingdom called Baldr. The kingdom had two princesses with radically different personalities: Skogul, the frail but clever second princess, and Geironul, the healthy and frisky first princess.

        The two princesses used to share an intimate bond in the past. Yet, it changed when Geironul failed to uphold the grace and decorum that a princess embodied. Not only did she embarrass herself in public, but she also secretly delved into the art of jousting. Finally, Skogul spoke out against her sister’s inelegant actions. Yet, her dissuasive words only evoked rage and resentment from Geironul, who had always had an inferiority complex toward her. The consistent feeling of inadequacy and frustration eventually festered within Geironul and erupted in a torrent of insults toward her younger sister.

        The intervention ended with Skogul leaving in tears, devastated by Geironul’s hurtful comments. She even told the king about Geironul’s clandestine hobbies. In a fit of rage, the king broke Geironul’s favorite lance, creating an irreparable rift between the two sisters. It was not until the king found himself in a perilous situation surrounded by demons during an inspection that the two sisters reconciled to combat the enemies together, and ultimately rescued their father.

        It was through this war that Skogul realized what Geironul possessed was exactly what she lacked, and hence she began working proactively with her sister to defend their country.

        With Skogul’s intelligence and Geironul’s bravery, the two sisters led their army to reclaim several towns occupied by the demons and saved the citizens from oppression. The consecutive triumphs greatly boosted the Baldrarmy’s morale; everyone, including Geironul, was visibly excited and proud, except Skogul, who had a strange sense of foreboding.

        ‘The demons retreated so quickly. They didn’t seem to care the trophies of their past triumphs. Something is amiss…’

         Skogul expressed her concern to Geironul, only to elicit a hearty laugh from her elder sister. Putting an arm around Skogul’s shoulder, Geironul took a big gulp from her wine jug and said, “Why worry so much? A win is a win. If the demons dare to return, we’ll just fight them back again!”

        “Yeah… You’re right,” Skogul, influenced by Geironul’s optimism, cast aside her worry and devoted herself wholeheartedly to the battle against the demons.

        One day, Skogul and Geironul led their troops to rescue a fallen town on the border.

        While Geironul led the main troop to engage the demons, Skogul took a small elite force to the rear of the town to rescue the trapped townsfolk and set fire to the demon’s food and arsenals.

        The battle unfolded smoothly according to Skogul’s plan. The main demon forces all advanced to tackle Geironul’s attack, leaving only a few inexperienced soldiers to guard the town. After finishing every enemy in a swift, Skogul successfully evacuated the townsfolk and set fire to the demons’ camp.

        A column of smoke billowed into the sky, forming a signal that every warrior on the front line could see. A fiery smile spread over Geironul’s face as she knew her sister had succeeded. Pointing her lance at the cunning male demon standing across from her, she proudly declared, “Astaroth, victory is ours once again.”

        Unexpectedly, Geironul’s triumphant declaration did not seem to shake the demon. Instead of panicking like a loser, Astaroth nonchalantly adjusted his glasses and remarked with confidence, “Indeed, it seems we’ve let you win too many times. Look at you becoming all haughty. It’s time to teach you a lesson.”

        Astaroth blew a war horn, producing a sound akin to a dragon’s roar. It echoed through the entire town as a dark green dragon carcass rose from the burning demon camp. Its body was dripping with mucus; the murky breaths that came through its nostrils extinguished the vitality of the land in an instant. It was a terrifying creature that would later be known in the North as the Dragon of Poison.

        ‘What is this… A monster… We can’t defeat it…’ Skogul, witnessing the monster up close, was overwhelmed by its destructive presence… Her body involuntarily trembled. It was not until the cries of her soldiers jolted her awake from the grip of fear that she hastily commanded her troops to disperse. Still, she failed to prevent a large number of soldiers from falling into the clutches of death.

        Ultimately, the war ended in a devastating defeat for Skogul and Geironul. Worst of all, it was only the beginning of Baldr’s tragic tale. The kingdom soon fell as its king perished on the battlefield against the demons who ravaged the land using the Dragon of Poison as a weapon.

        Although Skogul and Geironul had intended to stay and defend their kingdom when the demons invaded the palace, their uncle forcibly knocked them unconscious and took them to seclusion in the northern reaches, awaiting the day of their country’s restoration…
