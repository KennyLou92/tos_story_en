        <h1>Azure’s Blessing - Heshi</h1>
        <p>
                The sun hung high in the sky, casting blazing rays upon a vast expanse of farmland. Its fiery heat bore down upon a diligent young man who plowed the field while dripping with sweat. Despite the sweltering weather, he continued to wield his how with unwavering determination, turning the soil with powerful strikes.

        After a while, weariness crept upon the man, prompting a pause in his work. He straightened his bare torso to catch his breath, his sculpted muscles glistening with rivulets of sweat.

        Grabbing a water jug, he quenched his parched throat, his gaze drifting to the boundless azure above. Yet, the figure that had soared through the sky several days ago was nowhere to be seen, stirring an inexplicable feeling of disappointment within the man.

        “Qing Gui should be back soon,” the young man, Heshi, murmured to himself.

        Heshi was the governor of a modest country that had long grappled with poverty. It was through borrowing food from other countries and relentless farming that his people sought to secure sustenance. Yet, Heshi almost fell victim to a deceitful schemer. Fortunately, Qing Gui the Runedragon helped him and saved the country from bloodshed.

        With Qing Gui’s support and protection, Heshi led his people toward prosperity, steadily strengthening the country. At the same time, Qing Gui learned of the whereabouts of Xuan Huang and resolved to apprehend the felonious Runedragon. Reluctant to let Qing Gui embark on such a perilous journey alone, Heshi volunteered to accompany him and managed to save Qing Gui when he was in grave peril. Together, they triumphed over Ying Zheng, who had seized Xuan Huang’s body, putting an end to his scheme.

        However, their victory came at a price: Xuan Huang’s soul was completely destroyed. The tragic loss of a fellow Runedragon weighed heavily upon Qing Gui. Fortunately, he soon recovered thanks to Heshi’s companionship. Still, he had to return to the abode of Runedragons and report the turn of events regarding Xuan Huang, so he told Heshi about his temporary departure.

        Supportively, Heshi bid Qing Gui farewell. Little did he know that the parting would be so lonely. To pass the time, Heshi decided to work in the fields disregarding the objections of his subjects.

        Indeed,  time glides swiftly as a fleeting breeze when one is busy with tasks. And so, the day of Qing Gui’s return arrived.

        ‘I promised Qing Gui to make rice balls for him with the newly harvested rice when he returns. But now, I’m covered in sweat. He’ll surely find it distasteful. I have to wash and freshen up before I see him,’ Heshi thought with excitement. Just as he set aside his hoe and was ready to return to his residence, several villagers rushed toward him, their faces etched with panic and distress.

        “M-my Lord! B-bad news!”

        “What’s happened?” Heshi asked as he walked toward them.

        “Th-the rice fields… They have withered!”

        “What?!” Heshi exclaimed anxiously, “I just checked on them yesterday, and they were flourishing. They would have been ready for harvest in a couple of days. How could they suddenly wither?”

        “We have no idea either. The rice fields were all fine yesterday, but this morning, we found some strange vines growing in the fields and the rice plants around them have become wilted. We’re all at our wits’ end, and that’s why I immediately came to find you.”

        “Okay, I have a grasp of the situation. Lead me to the infested fields now!” Heshi commanded.

        Following the villagers, Heshi arrived at the rice fields where he saw an eerie cluster of dark purple vines entwined through the crops and the once thriving rice plants now drooped listlessly.

        Although only a small portion of the rice fields were infested with vines, the vines’ rapid growth posed an imminent threat that might lead to a devastating loss which would threaten the villagers’ survival through the coming winter.

        “Fret not. I will lead soldiers to uncover the source of these vines. Meanwhile, please help me gather the people and harvest what rice remains!” said Heshi with a reassuring smile that sought to assuage the anxious hearts of the villagers. Without further ado, he summoned a dozen soldiers and followed the winding path of the vines in the rice fields, tracing them into the depths of a remote forest.

        “My Lord! The vines are gone!” a soldier exclaimed.

        ‘That’s strange… How could the vines suddenly vanish? Could they be an unusual plant…’

        “Woah!” Suddenly, the soldiers’ startled cries interrupted Heshi’s train of thought. He turned around, only to see the soldiers ensnared by massive vines that had abruptly sprouted from the ground.

        “What happened— WOAH!” In Heshi’s attempt to come to the soldiers’ aid, he felt a sudden tremor beneath her feet, causing him to stumble and lose his balance. In the blink of an eye, the dark purple vines erupted from the earth, launching an assault upon Heshi with a ferocious momentum—

        Clang!

        A clear resonance reverberated through the air as a surge of elemental power erupted, annihilating the vines that tried to assail Heshi.

        ‘It’s the amulet Qing Gui gave me! It protected me!’Heshi looked at the fractured stone pendant hanging from his neck. It was a gift Qing Gui had given to him before his departure, said to serve as a protection.

        “Oh my, you destroy my precious vines. Who are you?”  A graceful figure materialized from the shadows of the forest—an enchantress of exquisite allure.

        “I am Heshi, the Lord of the Xianghe Empire. Who are you? Why have you invaded our land with these vines?” Heshi calmly inquired, his vigilant gaze locked onto the enchantress.

        “Because your land teems with pure elemental power. I was hungry and I needed food,”  the enchantress replied, her eyes scanning the soldiers before finally resting upon Heshi. With a gluttonous expression, she ran her tongue across her luscious lips, adding, “It seems not only is your land delightful, but your people smell quite delicious as well.”

        “You—”  Heshi’s heart quivered at the enchantress’ ravenous gaze, yet the sight of his ensnared soldiers and the suffering of his people stirred a tempest of fury within him. Brandishing his hoe, he glared at the enchantress and shouted with determination, “I won’t let you hurt my people or the fruits of our labor! We’ve poured our hearts into those rice fields, so there’s no way I, Heshi, will ever let an old monster who has not made any contribution like you share in our gains!”

        “An old…monster?” The enchantress repeated Heshi’s words, momentarily bewildered by their implication. However, as comprehension dawned upon her, a ferocious fury eclipsed her beautiful visage. So, she yelled, “You lousy human, how dare you insult me! I shall tear you to pieces!”

        With a wave of the enchantress’ hand, numerous vines burst forth from the earth behind her and hurtled toward Heshi. Undeterred, Heshi did not flinch, but instead, charged headlong toward the enchantress, wielding his hoe high in the air as he bellowed, “Haaaaa—! I won’t let you hurt my people!”

        “What… Why aren’t you running away… Argh!” The enchantress faltered. Taken aback by Heshi's unwavering determination, she suspected he possessed some formidable technique. Little did she know that Heshi was simply swinging his hoe with instinct, yet fate favored him—his hoe found its mark, leaving a deep gash on the enchantress’ arm.

        “Oh! I-I hit her!” Heshi, who seemed surprised by his own success, belatedly shouted with elation.

        “You… Despicable human! Unforgivable!” It was then that the enchantress realized her miscalculation, recognizing Heshi as an ordinary human. Consumed by anger and wounded pride, she resolved to unleash her full powers, conjuring a sphere of elemental power in her hands.

        ‘Ugh… Looks like I’ve gone too far. It seems that I will meet my end here today. Alas, it’s such a shame that I can’t say my last goodbye to Qing Gui,’ Heshi ruefully reflected, closing his eyes in regret.

        Boom!

        The impact of clashing powers sent clouds of dust swirling, obscuring everyone’s sight temporarily. To Heshi’s astonishment, he did not feel any pain; instead, he sensed a shroud of darkness before him, as if someone had shielded him from harm.

        “Why do I always find you in such dire situations?” A warm and gentle male voice resounded.

        “Qing Gui!” Heshi’s heart leaped with joy as he recognized the familiar voice. He immediately opened his eyes to look at the blue-haired man, Qing Gui in his human form, before him.

        Then, Heshi puckered his lips and pointed at the bedraggled enchantress, who had been sent flying through the air, and began complaining to Qing Gui, “This is not what I’ve planned! It’s all that old monster’s fault! She unleashed those disgusting and wiggly vines into our precious rice fields and drained the essence from our plump and ivory grains! That’s why I couldn’t make any rice balls for you!”

        “You’re…a Runedragon!” The enchantress, gathering her composure amidst the chaos, slowly rose to her feet. She looked at Qing Gui and asked in confusion, “Why would you help a despicable human like him?”


        “Humph!” Qing Gui scoffed coldly, disdainfully looking down at the enchantress, “It’s none of your business! But you depriving me of rice balls is reason enough for me to teach you a lesson!” 

        “Bu-but the Runedragons feed on clouds and mist, right? You don’t need human food!”

        “Can’t I occasionally indulge in something different? Besides, I despise those who steal the fruits of others’ labor. So, beat it now!”

        Qing Gui mustered his power, summoning a mighty gust of wind from his right hand which effortlessly blew the enchantress into the sky, sending her to the distant horizon.

        “Don’t you old monster dare come back! I’ll beat you if I ever see your face again!” An angry shout came from the lips of Heshi, who had somehow positioned him before Qing Gui, as he looked at the flying enchantress.

        “Did you beat her? Just asking because you sound so confident,” said Qing Gui, glancing at Heshi, a hint of indescribable resignedness flickering in his eyes.

        “Uh… Of course you did. I was just bluffing my way through, haha,” said Heshi with a fawning smile. Qing Gui, finding it hard to reprimand Heshi, could only let out a soft snort, his sleeves fluttering as he turned around.

        “Do you know how exhausted I am to clean up your mess after returning from a long journey? Now get me some food!”

        “Yes, yes, of course! I’ll get right to it!” Heshi responded loudly with enthusiasm, turning to follow Qinggui.

        ‘...My Lord, we’re still stuck here!’  The soldiers, still ensnared by the vines, wept in desolation as they watched their lord gradually fade into the distance.</p>
