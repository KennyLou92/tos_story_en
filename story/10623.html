        <h1>Parasitical Cost - Zhao Feiyan</h1>
        <p>        In a room of a magnificent oriental mansion, Zhao Feiyan sat in front of her dressing table, deliberately checking her reflection in the mirror. Although time had etched its imprints on her face, her beauty remained exquisite. Still, she could not help but apply some powder and a touch of rouge to conceal those subtle lines. Suddenly, her eyes widened, stared at a corner of her reflection aghast.

        Trembling, she took out a strand of hair near her ear, pulling out the only gray hair hidden amidst her black tresses. As she looked at the strand of white hair, her face crumpled, and she anxiously exclaimed, “Why would I have gray hair… No! I must pluck it out!”

        Just as Zhao Feiyan was about to pluck out the gray hair, a woman appeared from behind and grabbed hold of her wrist, urgently shouted, “My Lady! You mustn’t pluck it!”

        “Xiao Tao?” Zhao Feiyan looked at her maid who had come along with her as a form of dowry. With a puzzled expression, she asked, “Why can’t I pluck it?”

        “There’s a saying in my hometown that plucking one gray hair will cause more to grow, so you must never pluck it,” Xiao Tao replied.

        “What should I do about this gray hair then?”

        “We can dye it black with ink. I’m skilled in it, so leave it to me.”

        “Thank you,” Feiyan said and smiled in relief but then fell into deep thought.  After a moment of hesitation, she spoke again, “Xiao Tao, is my husband visiting today?”

        Xiao Tao’s hands paused for a second while preparing the hair dye. She let out a long sigh, “My Lady, forgive for speaking frankly. Sir has recently taken a youthful and charming concubine. Given her slim figure and dexterity in playing the guqin, of course, Sir would be more inclined to spend time with her. I’m afraid that it’s likely you won’t see him for quite some time.”

        “How can this be… My husband loves watching me dance. Perhaps I should practise more”—

        “No!” Xiao Tao hurriedly interrupted Zhao Yanfei’s words. “Your body doesn’t allow you to perfor strenuous practice. You fainted during your last dance practice. You mustn’t push yourself!”

        “What should I do then? If this continues, will I be abandoned…” Zhao Feiyan’s voice trailed off, filled with worry.

        “There’s a simple solution to that question: you just have to become even more beautiful,” Xiao Tao interjected. Leaning closer to Zhao Feiyan, she asked, “My Lady, why don’t you try that?”

        “You mean consuming a demon fetus?” Zhao Feiyan furrowed her brow. “Although it’s rumored that the demon fetus helps restore youth, are there really no risks involved?”

        “Abandoning the chance of restoring youth is the real risk, My Lady. If you don’t take action, you might be overshadowed by the new concubine in the future.”

        “...Xiao Tao is right. I don’t have much time left. I might end up with losing everything if I don’t make a move now,” Zhao Feiyan contemplated and finally made up her mind. With a determined nod, she gritted her teeth and said, “Alright, I’ll do it.”

        “I’m so glad you finally made up your mind, My Lady! I’ll prepare it right away!” Overjoyed to hear Zhao Feiyan’s decision, Xiao Tao hurriedly ran off to prepare the demon fetus.

        However, Zhao Feiyan grew restless again as the room fell silent, filling her mind with images of dire consequences. She stood up impulsively, intending to call off the plan. Unexpectedly, a sweet and elegant fragrance wafted into her nostrils and instantly aroused her appetite before she could step out of the room.

        “My Lady, what you doing standing by the door? I’ve prepared the demon fetus. Please eat while it’s hot,” said Xiao Tao, lacing a white porcelain stew pot on the table and beckoning Zhao Feiyan with a smile.

        The tempting aroma overwhelmed Zhao Feiyan’s mind, dismantling her thought to backtrack. Step by step, she walked to the table. As she uncovered the stew pot, steam rose from within, revealing a smooth, white and tender paste with an even more intoxicating fragrance that surged forth and caused her mouth to water uncontrollably.

        All of Zhao Feiyan’s doubts were washed away by the aroma. She picked up a porcelain spoon and took a bite. Instantly, she was captivated by the enigmatic taste which urged her hand to take another scoop, one after another. Soon, she finished consumiung it all.

        “My Lady, how do you feel?” Xiao Tao asked.

        “I feel a warm sensation in my stomach…and I feel kind of drowsy.” Having just put down the spoon, Zhao Feiyan sensed a gentle warmth spreading from her abdomen, gradually flowing throughout her body. It was so pleasantly soothing that it made her sleepy.

        “Well. go ahead and have so rest then. Let your body digest it properly to bring out the best result.”

        Convinced by Xiao Tao, Zhao Feiyan went to bed early and fell into a deep sleep as soon as she closed her eyes. When she opened her eyes again, it was already noon of the following day. Unlike the usual fatigue that she had experienced in the past mornings, she felt remarkably energetic, as if her body was filled with boundless energy.

        “Xiao Tao?” Zhao Feiyan called out softly to her maid but received no response. Assuming that Xiao Tao must be preparing lunch, she got out of bed and freshened up. She sat in front of the dressing table only to be taken aback by her own reflection in the mirror.

        “My crow’s feet and the gray hair, they’re all gone!” Zhao Feiyan touched her cheeks, feeling a newfound tenderness in her skin. Motivated by elation, she dressed up herself with a vibrant, light chiffon dress.

        “The weather today is so nice, and since I’ve gotten all dressed up, let me go for a walk,” Zhao Feiyan thought to her self. Brimming with energy, she could hardly sit still in her room so she went for a stroll in the courtyard without waiting for Xiao Tao’s return.

        Basked in the warmth of the sunlight, Zhao Feiyan felt utterly content. However, a gust of wind caught her off guard and blew her handkerchief out of her grasp, sending it soaring into the branches of a tall tree near the lake.

        “That handkerchief is the keepsake my husband gave me back then… I must retrieve it!” Reluctant to lose the handkerchief, Zhao Feiyan made up her mind after a brief hesitation. She gathered her skirt and rolled up her sleeves, took a deep breath, and leaped forward. Like a swan, her body soared through the air, first landing on the railing beside the tree, then jumping onto one of its branches.  Her movements were as graceful and agile as a dancing fairy, accentuated by her light chiffon dress.

        In a few swift movements, she reached the branch where her handkerchief was entangled. She stretched out her hand, retrieved the hooked fabric, and held it close to her chest. However, she heard a crack—the withered branch snapped due to her weight.

        Inevitably, Zhao Feiyan lost her balance and bagan to fell. Just as she thought she would land with severe injuries, someone caught her. Opening her eyes, she saw her long yearned-for husband holding her in his arms.

        “My Lord!”

        “Feiyan, why would you climb up a tree?” Zhao Feiyan’s husband gently set her down and furrowed his brow, scolding her. Zhao Feiyan lowered her head in guilt, clutching the handkerchief tightly in her hand, and softly confessed, “Because it was something you gave me, my Lord. It would break my heart if I lost it.”

        “You…” Zhao Feiyan’s husband immediately recognized the handkerchief which brought back the romantic memories of their past, reigniting his longing for Zhao Feiyan. Thinking back to Zhao Feiyan’s graceful and captivating leap onto the tree, sensual desire stirred within the man’s heart. He put his arm around Zhao Feiyan’s slender waist, his voice deep and intimate as he whispered, “I’m sorry that I have neglected you lately, but I will make it up to you, tonight.”

        “My Lord…” Zhao Feiyan’s eyes welled up with tears of joy. Shyly, she buried her head into her husband’s arms. The two love birds then returned to their room and shared a sweet and intimate night they had not had since a while. It was a happiest night that Zhao Feiyan had ever experienced in her life.

        Unfortunately, her happiness came to an end shortly.

        In the middle of the night, Zhao Feiyan woke up due to intense hunger pangs. Carefully, she lifted the quilt and got out of bed lest she disturbed her soundly sleeping husband.

        It was already late at night, and the mansion was silent. Unwilling to trouble the servants, Zhao Feiyan stealthily  made her way to the kitchen, hoping to find something to satisfy her hunger.

        “There are steamed buns, perfect.” Zhao Feiyan found some steamed buns that the chef had prepared on the counter. She eagerly picked one up and took a bite. However, her hunger was still not satiated after she finished one; but the contrary, her hunger grew stronger. The nagging emptiness urged her to disregard her manners, compelling her to grab two more steamed buns and voraciously devour them.

        Soon, all the steamed buns were all gone while Zhao Feiyan’s belly bulged as if she were pregnant. Still, her intense craving for food remained unabated.

        “Oh, why do I still feel hungry… My stomach is growling… I want more… More…” The instinctual drive for food destroyed Zhao Feiyan’s rationality. With her eyes wandering and her mouth incessantly murmuring, her nose twitched as she searched for anything that could fill the void in her stomach. Sniffing along the way, she stopped to eat whenever she found something that could temporarily satisfy her hunger, then moved on and searched again once she finished.

        However, even after devouring everything in the kitchen, Zhao Feiyan still felt hungry. It was as if someone had opened a hole in her stomach, and no matter how much she ate, it would simply drain away, leaving her unsatisfied.

        “I want food… I have to eat… eat…” Driven by the overwhelming hunger, Zhao Feiyan unconsciously walked out of the kitchen and made her way to the courtyard in search of something to fill her stomach. Yet, as she passed by the lake, the reflection in the water caught her attention… 

        In the reflection was a a colossal figure with swollen limbs and torso resembling an overinflated balloon. Nevertheless, one could still recognize the person’s face.

        “This is me…” Zhao Feiyan  incredulously touched her own face, only to feel a wetness that carried a putrid stench. She lowered her head to look at her swollen hands which were now stained with fresh blood. It must have been from devouring the raw meat in the kitchen moments ago—she vaguely remembered.

        It was then that Zhao Feiyan’s rationality that had been submerged by hunger, resurfaced. Blown by the ghastly reality, she let out a piercing scream, “Nooooo! No! This can’t be real! That isn’t me!”

        “Hmm… Who is it making all the noise?” A child of around seven or eight years old walked out from his roo, rubbing his eyes in annoyance. However, when he saw Zhao Feiyan, his exasperation turned into a horrified shout, “Mon-monster!”

        “No… I’m not a monster…” As much as Zhao Feiyan attempted to defend herself,  the insatiable hunger once again took over her sanity. She was once again consumed by the primal drive for food, her gaze fixed on the terrified child who was now fleeing. She involuntarily murmured, “Food... delicious food...”

        Zhao Feiyan maneuvered her colossal body and leaped in front of the child, opening her mouth wide as a string of saliva dripped down. Ravenously, she said to the child, who had already wet his pants in fear, “I want to eat... eat... hehe…”</p>
