        <h1>Twisted Tribulation - Ghatanothoa</h1>
        <p>Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.7

        On the remnants of a dead planet, a headless mass of flesh, Y’golonac, chuckled while turning the handle of a spinning contraption. On the sides of the contraption were two upward-pointing spindles that pierced through two listless torsos—Ghatanothoa and Atlach, the twins whom Y’golonac and Mordiggian had cunningly ensnared through their vile machinations and used as the raw materials for making the thread of causality.

        Just then, the colossal contraption turned steadily, just like the eternal cycle of life and death; but for Ghatanothoa, it was nothing but a cruel torment.

        “AHHHHH—! It hurts—! Atlach! Help me! Help me!” The excruciating pain of its soul being squeezed and wrung drove Ghatanothoa to the brink of madness and chaos where it instinctively sought salvation from its most trusted brother.

        Right before Ghatanothoa’s consciousness crumbled, a gentle radiance enveloped it, bringing it unprecedented tranquility and solidity.

        Ghatanothoa returned to a state reminiscent of its preexistence when Atlach and it were still one undivided stone. Back then, they were both complete without any difference or distance between them. The fulfillment of returning to one slowly restored Ghatanothoa’s fractured soul, its consciousness becoming clear. From within that radiance, it heard a familiar voice.

        “With my flawed self merging into your innocence, I can now become a part of the grace, the existence you have always pursued and loved.”

        The radiance suddenly intensified, as if expending its final strength to kindle the brightest blaze of its existence. Engulfed by the scorching brilliance, Ghatanothoa felt its soul seared with an ominous premonition as if it was about to lose something important.

        Ghatanothoa attempted to reach out and touch the radiance, but its mending soul remained immobilized. It was only able to perceive the fading brilliance and the final words it whispered,

        “Ghatanothoa, it has been my utmost bliss to be your brother and the solace of your soul.”

        “No… No! Don’t leave me alone! Atlach—!” Ghatanothoa cried out, but the warm radiance had already departed, leaving its repaired form—vigorous and beastly—engulfed in a desolate and icy solitude. Ghatanothoa then awoke from the depths of its consciousness, only to find itself alone amid the remains of a silent planet, with only the colossal contraption as a solemn companion.

        The spindles on either side of the contraption had corroded as a result of its brother’s sacrifice. Atlach had used its venom to erode the spindles, paying the ultimate price for mending Ghatanothoa’s fragmented soul with its own essence.

        “Why… If I knew that my existence depends on the cessation of yours, I would rather step into eternal darkness, guarding you beyond the stars... Atlach... my brother... How deeply I love you, longing for your eternal bliss... Roarrrr—!” As the overwhelming grief exceeded Ghatanothoa’s threshold, it lost control and wailed in anguish with tears streaming down its face.

        The abundant power carried within Ghatanothoa’s tears revitalized the desolate land, causing vegetation and life to rapidly flourish, which alerted the lurking clone of Y’golonac in the lair.

        With a glance, Y’golonacpondered upon the events that had unfolded in this place mere moments ago, then it disdainfully sneered, “Tut! Atlach, that fool. I can’t believe it sacrificed its very soul to save you—Argh!”

        Upon hearing the mockery aimed at Atlach, Ghatanothoa was consumed by rage. It lunged toward Y’golonac’s clone and devoured it with a wide-open maw. With a ferocious snarl, Ghatanothoa declared, “This is the consequence of insulting Atlach, you vile destroyer!”

        “Ha, it seems you’ve forgotten that your brother was also a follower of destruction,” said another headless mass of flesh that materialized behind Ghatanothoa, its tone laced with a scornful and confident air.

        “And it appears you’ve also forgotten that this is my lair,” added another headless mass of flesh that emerged from a different direction.

        “Even if you kill one of me, there are still countless clones here.” Another Y’golonac’s clone sneered as it approached from the shadows.

        “Well then, I shall kill you all!” Ghatanothoa showed no fear as the anger of losing its brother consumed every fiber of its being. All that remained in its mind was the desire to eliminate the Y’golonac, who had tortured its sibling

        “Let’s put such arrogance to the test!” A colossal clone of Y’golonac, even larger than the others, descended from above, while numerous other clones surged forward from all directions, converging upon Ghatanothoa. In an instant, Ghatanothoa was engulfed by a multitude of headless flesh forms.

        “A weakling is always weakling, tsk… Wh-what is that?” The largest clone of Y’golonac chuckled softly, standing at a distance. However, its laughter abruptly ceased when it witnessed eight dark shadows emerging from Ghatanothoa, forcefully scattering the headless masses entangled around it.

        “I may be a naive and ignorant weakling but my brother…Atlach is certainly not! It is the most beautiful existence in this world! It is whom I admire and cherish the most… It’s the half of my soul and it always protects me!” exclaimed Ghatanothoa, wielding the eight dark shadows—eight spiky appendages identical to Atlach’s!

        The eight appendages deftly maneuvered through the scattered headless masses, piercing, crushing, and reducing them to mounds of indistinct flesh. In the blink of an eye, the tide had turned completely, and Ghatanothoa held a distinct advantage.

        “Tut! This creature is more troublesome than I anticipated. Nevertheless, we’ve got the thread of causality. It is not wise to continue this battle; escape is the prudent course of action!” The massive clone of Y’golonac, who had been observing from the sidelines, realized its inferior position and swiftly turned to flee. However, Ghatanothoa was quick to discern its intentions.

        “You can’t run away from me!” Ghatanothoa opened its maw wide, gathering energy to unleash a powerful beam—

        “Aaahhh—!” The beam pierced through the colossal clone’s body and then swept across all the Y’golonac’s clones as Ghatanothoa turned its gaze, filling the cosmos with cries of pain and agonized screams.

        It was only after a moment that the one-sided slaughter finally ceased. Not a single headless mass remained alive; they lay strewn across the flower-laden grassland. Their bodily fluids nourished the earth and vegetation; buds bloomed in abundance and released the most intense fragrance that mingled with the scent of death, creating a most eerie olfactory spectacle.

        “I won… Atlach, I have vanquished those who tormented you...” Ghatanothoa gazed upon the gruesome scene before it, yet devoid of any triumphant joy. Only deep-seated weariness emanated from its core, both mental and physical. “But what comes next... I am all alone... How am I to live alone... Atlach...”

        Ghatanothoa had lost the will to exist, yet could not abandon the life that Atlach had traded for. It could only allow its body to drift through the cosmos, letting its thoughts dissolve and staring blankly at boundless galaxies and stars until a shimmering figure of golden light appeared before them. 

        The power of vibrancy awakened Ghatanothoa’s long-dormant senses. It looked up at the exquisitely beautiful figure like a lost child catching sight of their parents. The wounds that had accumulated over numerous years once again festered, causing hot tears to well in its eyes.

        “Daoloth, you’re here,” Ghatanothoa whispered with a choked voice, extending its forelimb to embrace the golden figure. Daoloth returned the embrace, gently caressing Ghatanothoa’s rugged carapace.

        “Ghatanothoa, my pitiful child, I’m sorry that I arrived too late, and caused your suffering,” Daoloth lowered its gaze and comforted Ghatanothoa with a voice full of compassion and tenderness, “I have come to fulfill your desires.” 

        “My desires...” Ghatanothoa was confused at first, but upon seeing the scarred universe, it understood what Daoloth meant. At that moment, the desolate soul found solace and began to feel the pulsation of life once again.

        Ghatanothoa shed its despair and regained the purity of its early existence. It prostrated itself before Daoloth, lifting its head, and naively pleaded, “Please, use me and Atlach to mend this universe. Then we can be together forever, gazing and embracing both beauty and flaws until the end of the cosmos.”

        “This time, I won’t let you be alone. If understanding you and redeeming you means tarnishing the beauty of life, I shall embrace the mire and yearn to become imperfect. Atlach, being born as your brother is the most unparalleled miracle to me.”

        Holding the most devout faith, Ghatanothoa closed its eyes and returned to its primordial state in the embrace of Daoloth, and in the hands of the lord of creation, it was born anew once more...</p>
