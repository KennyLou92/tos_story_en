        <h1>Beguiling White Snake - Hana</h1>
        <p>        Inside the kimono rental store of “Grand Villa”, the hot spring tourist attraction, a gorgeous lady in a kimono was lying on the couch. Her loose clothes offered a fair display of shoulders and bosom, showing her curves perfectly. The faint mist inside the room made her even sexier and appealing.

        She was surrounded by a group of men of all ages. The one thing in common was that they were handsome. All of them were serving the only lady in the room, trying to impress her by fulfilling every request of hers, from serving her meals to preparing her bath. They were willing to give everything to the apple of their eyes.

        “Cough cough...My beautiful Hana-san.”

        Furry the komainu was choked by the smoke as soon as he entered the store, and he finally stated the purpose of his visit after a while of coughing, “You’re the most beautiful youkai I’ve ever seen. There’s no one who can be more charming than you…”

        “So? What do you want from me?” Hana the gorgeous youkai glanced at Furry.

        “I...I don’t wanna die. Hana-san, please help me in bringing more revenue to my shop!”

        The landlord, the owner of “Grand Villa”, ordered the youkais to make the business thrive within a week. The one with least revenue will be barbecued. And now all the youkais were doing everything they could to survive.

        Furry had tried to sabotage the others’ plans but all his attempts had failed, so he came to Hana this time with his only skills——flattery.

        “Oh, right,” said Hana.

        Furry was thrilled as he thought it was a yes from Hana, but his hope was shattered right away.

        “Not interested. What good does it do to me? What can you offer?”

        Hana giggled.

        “I’m doing good here. Although that useless landlord took my treasure away, my customers here give me money and I can buy the kimonos I love...I have enough income to sustain the store. The landlord is the only one who doesn’t know about it.”

        When Hana was done speaking, she went back to flirt with the men. Meanwhile, Furry was surprised by how she tamed the male creatures inside the room.

        Furry shook his head to clear his mind, and he asked, “Then what can I do to talk you into this?”

        “Ten men. Oh no.” Hana counted with her fingers and said, “bring me one thousand men for the greeting gift. Then ten thousand more. By then, we’ll talk.”

        “Are you messing with me…?”

        The impossible request provoked Furry, who still didn’t like to be played in spite of his brown-nose nature.

        “Aw, men are willing to be messed by me, aren’t they?”

        When Hana was done speaking, someone moaned under her.

        Furry didn’t notice a man under Hana until now. Despite being the human chair, the man was not in pain at all, as if this was the best treatment he could ever get from Hana. He looked so happy and blissful.

        “Darn it! You think I don’t know your weak spot!? Take this!” Furry was pissed after all the failures and embarrassments. He conjured a water stream, flushing towards Hana.

        It wasn’t a strong current but it accomplished what Furry wanted——exposing Hana’s lower body underneath the kimono. To the men’s surprise, it wasn’t a pair of long legs but a snake tail!

        Petrified at first, all the men fled as soon as they realised that Hana was a snake youkai.

        Only Furry and the soaking wet Hana were left in the store. While Furry was gloating over Hana’s misfortune, Hana was enraged by the messed-up store, the loss of her male pets and the dirts on her beloved kimonos…

        “How dare you mess up my kimonos…”

        The pupils of Hana narrowed, exuding the hostility of a snake.

        “...Unforgivable!”

        As Hana was done speaking, she shifted back to the snake form to attack Furry, who dodged the bite and counterattacked by shooting a spike at her. With a flip, Hana counteracted the attack.

        However, they were much weaker without their treasures. Although it sounded like a fierce battle, it was actually a fight between two petty youkais. Coincidentally, their actions broke the wooden floor underneath, which had cracks already. The two youkais then fell into a secret basement. 

        “Huh? What’s this?”

        Furry spotted a chest, and the angry Hana retorted, “It’s just an old box.”

        When Furry opened the chest, he shouted in surprise, “My fortune ball!”

        Hana came over as she was curious about Furry’s reaction. It was the youkais’ treasures that were stored inside the chest! Their slavery had only begun because the landlord had taken away their treasures, and the treasures had been under their feet all along!

        “What happened?”

        The other youkais in the villa came over as they heard the chaos, and this visit led them back to their treasures! Now all the youkais were freed from the slavery. What a piece of good news!

        “Right, before we leave...Furry, do you remember? You stole our lunchboxes before…” Hibiki scowled at Furry.

        “Daruma...Daruma!” (He framed me for breaking the landlord’s vase!)” Dadaru was rolling on the ground angrily.

        “Speaking of which, he made my kimono dirty…” Hana hissed at Furry with a fake smile.

        “Let’s take down the vermont here first!”

        The present youkais had Furry cornered, everyone approached him hostilely. 

        “Everyone calm down. I didn’t do them on purpose back then…” Furry panicked.

        “Everyone, GO!” As Hana commanded, all the youkais pounced on Furry together.

        “AHHHHHHH——!!” Furry fled the scene while screaming.

        To the other youkais, this was a lucky day that marked the end of their slavery; yet to Furry, this was the day when karma landed on him.
