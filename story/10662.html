        Johannes Kepler</i></b>


        At the Oroz Management Center entrance, a male machina paced impatiently, his arms crossed before his chest. After completing his tenth round, a female machina finally arrived, belatedly.

        “Laura, you’re fifty-three seconds late.” Kepler, the male machina, said with a disapproving look as he glanced at the woman.

        “Kepler, loosen up. Fifty-three seconds mean nothing compared to a hundred years,” Laura responded, smiling playfully. Instead of getting annoyed by Kepler’s strictness, she calmly reassured him, “Besides, I was late because I went to get the key to our operation.”

        Kepler and Laura were both agents of the Emergency Unit in the Oroz Management Center, only one superior than the other, tasked with handling various special missions. Last night, in the early hours, the center received a signal from a patrol spaceship that had been wanted for nearly a century. Urgently, Kepler and Laura were summoned to carry out the pursuit.

        “The key?” Kepler paused for a moment and asked, “So, you got the key of Lilith, the synthetic soul.”

        “That’s right,” Laura said, taking out a mechanical sphere with a intricately high-tech design. “With her, we can hack into the operating system of Montana and take control of the spaceship, just like the last time.”

        “But I hope you won’t disobey my order again. Last time, you activated the self-destruct sequence in New Hampshire, giving the Guide, Nuada, the chance to escape,” said Kepler, taking the key from Laura’s hand, “I’ll keep the key this time.”

        “Of course,” Laura shrugged and smiled. Her obedient demeanor slightly eased Kepler’s displeasure.

        “Now that we’re all set, let’s get going,” Kepler said, putting away the key. Together, they went to the docking port and boarded a small armed spaceship.

        Kepler sat in the pilot’s seat, skillfully starting the spaceship. He executed the launch procedure flawlessly like the best tutorial, and smoothly departed from Spiral Star, the home planet of machinas, venturing into the cosmic expanse.

        Unfortunately, accidents are always unpredictable.

        During their journey, they saw a tourist spacecraft under a Midden’s attack. The spacecraft faced a precarious situation as the Midden’s enormous gray body strangled its hull. Kepler, as the main pilot, reflexively changed course to rush to the spacecraft’s rescue, but Laura stopped him, pressing her hand firmly against his.

        “Kepler, our mission is to capture the fugitives. We shouldn’t waste our time saving a tourist spacecraft,” she said.

        “You—” Kepler’s eyes widened in disbelief as he raised his voice in protest, “Are we just going to watch the tourist spacecraft being attacked by a Midden and do nothing?”

        “I’ve already sent out an emergency distress signal,” Laura answered.

        “But the Midden can tear the spaceship apart in any second. It’ll be too late by the time th rescue arrives!” Kepler exclaimed.

        “Even someone like us wouldn’t be capable of handling a Midden of this magnitude. We would only increase the number of casualties if we go to rescue them,” Laura explained.

        Middens are unintelligent extraterrestrial creatures that have proliferated throughout the universe. Some possess an intense sense of aggression and exhibit destructive abilities that differ according to their ranks, and the Midden in front of them was classified as one of the high ranks, one that not only possessed formidable physicality but also likely had concomitant abilities.

        “That’s enough!” Kepler forcefully pushed Laura aside, his face displaying resolute determination. “I’m going to rescue them, and I’ll take all the responsibility. If you’re against it, you can just leave and wait for rescue in a safe zone.”

        Laura was momentarily stunned. Kepler’s unwavering resolve reminded her of a nostalgic figure, stirring something deep within her. It was after a brief moment of silence that she spoke again, “Fine. I’ll go with you.”

        As much as Kepler was surprised by Laura’s sudden change of heart, the dire situation left him no time for contemplation. He cast aside his doubts and focused on piloting the spaceship, redirecting toward the tourist spacecraft at the highest speed.

        Alarmed by Kepler’s racing spaceship, the Midden extended six thick tendrils to attack it. One would normally reduce speed and evade when faced with such a ferocious assault, but not Kepler. He executed a series of intricate maneuvers to evade the attack while maintaining high speed.

        His spaceship narrowly eluded the attack tendrils several times, generating sparks due to the intense friction. Still, Kepler remained undeterred and pressed forward, piloting the spaceship toward the Midden. At close range, all laser cannons emerged on the spaceship, aiming for the Midden’s head. Without hesitation, Kepler pressed the firing button—

        Zap!

        As the laser cannons unleashed a series of explosive beams on the Midden’s head, a pungent smell of burnt flesh emanated from its body, eliciting a piercing cry. Severely wounded, the Midden could no longer constrict the tourist spacecraft but only let its grayish-white body slip away from the spaceship.

        “Laura! Get into the tourist spacecraft now and fly it away from here!” Kepler shouted.

        “What about you?” Laura asked.

        “The laser cannons won’t kill a Midden of this class. I’ll stay here and contain it,” Kepler answered.

        “...Alright.” Laura decisively jumped out of the spaceship and maneuvered toward the tourist spacecraft. Meanwhile, the Midden had recovered from the impact. Enraged by the attack, it gathered energy in front of its mouth, forming multiple plasma spheres that hurtled toward Kepler’s spaceship.

        Seeing through the Midden’s moves, Kepler skillfully evaded the explosive spheres. However, he never expected that the non-sentient Midden would employ a diversionary tactic—it redirected one of the plasma spheres toward the tourist spacecraft!

        ‘The spacecraft will be doomed if it gets hit!’ Kepler gritted his teeth and quickly altered the spaceship’s course, hurtling directly toward the plasma sphere.

        BOOM!

        The plasma sphere struck Kepler’s spaceship, blasting away half of it. As Kepler was flung out of the spaceship, the key of Lilith also tumbled out of his pocket, drifting into the depths of space. Although Kepler attempted to retrieve it, his body was firmly seized by the tendrils of the Midden.

        The explosion left Kepler severely wounded, rendering him unable to break free from the Midden’s grip. He could only feel his body being gradually compressed and even emanating a cracking sound. As his consciousness started to fade, he gazed into the vast darkness of space, reluctantly contemplating, ‘Damn it… Am I going to die here…?’

        Suddenly, a flash of silver light appeared on the Midden’s tendrils constricting Kepler. In the next seconds, the tendrils fell apart and slid away as if they had been sliced by a razor-sharp blade. As Kepler regained his freedom, he looked up only to see a colossal humanoid robot standing between him and the Midden. The gleaming lightsaber in the robot’s hand clearly indicated that it was the one who had saved him.

        As much as Kepler wanted to ask the questions in his head, the consecutive injuries had drained his strength and willpower. Darkness engulfed him, plunging him into a state of unconsciousness.

❉

        When Kepler regained his consciousness, he found himself in an unfamiliar cabin. Laura, sitting on the other side of the couch while reading through documents, quickly noticed Kepler’s awakening.

        “You’re finally awake,” Laura greeted him with a perfectly affable smile, like a mask, to which Kepler had always felt a sense of aversion. He turned away his gaze to survey the surroundings, and asked,         “Where are we? What happened to the tourist spacecraft?”

        “We’re in the premium cabin of Montana, the battlecruiser. The passengers from the tourist spaceship have been relocated to Montana’s cabins. There are a total of 128 passengers, with 22 casualties and 35 injured, all of whom have received medical treatment.”

        “Wait… Did you just say we’re on the Montana… So I was saved by the fugitive battleship, Montana, and its Guide, Scáthach?” Kepler found the reality incredibly absurd. He could not fathom being rescued by the wanted criminals, a truth that was hard for him to take in for a moment.

        “That’s correct,” Laura confirmed.

        Kepler closed his eyes, taking a while to digest the fact. With a stiff sense of remorse, he said, “...I lost the key of Lilith during the rescue. It’s all my fault.”

        “It’s not your fault. You did you best given the situation. However, since we have lost the key, we have to change our plan,” Laura pondered for a moment and continued with a faint smile, “I’ve talked to the Guide, Scáthach, earlier. She has a very simple personality, following the regulation of prioritizing assistance to those in need. We can use the passengers from the tourist spaceship to set up a trap…”

        “No!” Kepler strongly vetoed. His expression darkened as he stared at Laura and berated her, “We can’t put innocent people into danger for our mission! Absolutely not!”

        Laura remained quiet for a moment, and then, with a  even brighter smile, she nodded and said, “You’re right. I wasn’t thinking it thoroughly.”

        “...Glad we’ve reached a consensus.”

        “I’ll go gather some information and see if there is anything helpful for us to formulate a new plan,” said Laura friendlily, showing no signs of resentment from her proposal being rejected. She then turned and left the cabin, leaving Kepler to rest.

        However, the unexpected turn of events left Kepler restless. He tossed and turned for a while until a knock on the door sounded.

        “He-hello, I’m Scáthach, the Guide of this battleship. I’m here to give you some liquid nutrients specially designed for machinas,” a voice said.

        “...Come in,” Kepler straightened his posture to welcome Scáthach. She looked exactly as described in the files—innocent and harmless.

        “Are you feeling okay?” Scáthach placed the liquid nutrient  on the table beside the bed and sat down on a chair with a disciplined posture,  resembling a well-behaved student before a teacher.

        “Yes, I’m fine. Thank you for saving me.”

        “That’s great to hear! It’s my first time meeting someone other than Monty that I can talk to, and so many at once. I was so nervous that I completely forgot about the patrol regulations,” Scáthach kept talking eagerly.

        ‘Despite being wanted criminals, she and the battleship were willing to save me and the tourist spacecraft. Perhaps they aren’t as ruthless and cruel as the Guide and the battleship we met last time. Maybe I can talk them into surrender…’

        Kepler contemplated, looking at Scáthach’s innocent and carefree face. He made the decision to be honest with her and tell her everything. “My name is Kepler. I’m an agent from the Oroz Management Center. I came here to arrest—”

        However, before Kepler could finish his confession, a piercing alarm blared throughout the entire battleship.

        “Monty! What happened?” asked Scáthach, who immediately stood up, looking up.

        “The incinerator on the lower deck has reached abnormally high temperatures, and someone blocked my signal. I can’t access the incineration chamber, but I can see three human teenagers lying unconscious on the floor through the surveillance camera outside the chamber. They should be passengers from the tourist spacecraft.”

        “This is bad! I’ll go and save them!” Scáthach hurriedly rushed out of the cabin. Meanwhile, Kepler recalled Laura’s proposal, feeling a sense of unease. He mustered his strength and caught up with Scáthach, regardless of his physical condition…</p>
