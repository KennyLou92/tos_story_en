        <h1>Katawaguruma the Shikigami</h1>
        <p>
                In the past, there was a renowned artist who was bent on illustrating his most desired image at any cost; he was willing even to sacrifice his own daughter for it, allowing her to be consumed by fire alive.  It was said that the spirits of the girl and her father would travel among paintings.  She would drag in the parents who abused their children, while the father would brutally murder the abused children... 

        Inside an inn room, there were noises of a couple shouting and slapping; a girl’s wailing rang out in between. 

        “Didn’t I tell you to follow us closely?  The crowds at the sacrificial rites were huge!  Why do you never listen?”  The mother grew increasingly agitated as she scolded the girl. 

        The father stepped forward from the side and slapped the girl, leaving her wailing... 

        At that moment, no one was paying attention to the painting hanging on the wall of the room; a carriage engulfed in roaring flames had suddenly appeared. The fire burned, and from inside the carriage, a young maiden poked her head out to look at the parents.  The maiden had a smile on her face, and the harsher their punishment, the heartier the girl’s laughter.  The trio all heard the eerie laughter  inside the room.  The father had froze, for this laughter had chilled the spines of all those present.

        The couple felt distressed; yet, as they were about to leave, they found that they had been rendered immobile. It was as if something had grabbed hold of their heads.  Just then, they heard a young maiden speak to them from behind, “Come, let me show you the realm of the painting!”  With that, the girl watched as the young maiden dragged her parents into the painting; they were locked inside the carriage and burnt to death.  Frightened, the girl wanted to escape;yet, she found that a man who had appeared from nowhere had grabbed her leg!

        “Little girl, your skin is as soft as my beloved daughter!”  The man with his hair dishevelled said as he pulled the girl towards himself.  That night ended with the girl’s piercing screams... 

        The next morning, an inn staff knocked on the door as he did daily.  When he opened the door, what he saw terrified him...  The whole room had been dyed crimson by blood.  Just as the staff walked inside, he slipped on something and fell over.  He caught hold of it,  and realized what he had slipped on was human skin!  The terror of the sight left him vomiting. When he somewhat calmed himself down, he gazed around the room; what he saw invoked images of hell...  Scattered around the room were ripped skin and crushed bone dripping with blood... </p>
