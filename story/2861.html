        <h1>Shackles of Love - Gretchen</h1>
        <p>
                In a cozy and elegant cottage, a young woman named Gretchen was trying on different clothes in her room. However, judging by the multitude of garments over the chairs, table, and sofa, she seemed unable to find one that truly pleased her.

        After quite some time, Gretchen finally selected three dresses from her extensive collection and placed them on the bed. Stroking her chin, she scrutinized them left and right.

        “Today is my wedding anniversary with Faust, and we must celebrate it properly. The food is ready, all that’s left is my clothes. Which one should I wear?” Gretchen pondered, torn between sweetness and worry.

        Gretchen had supported herself since she was young, due to her parents’ early passing. She had grown accustomed to bearing all hardships alone until, by a twist of fate, she met Faust. It was in that very instant when their eyes met that Gretchen knew she had found the person she had been searching for all her life—the shoulder she could lean on, so she married him shortly after.

        However, Faust was always overly concerned about Gretchen. He would search the entire city for her if she was home even slightly late. He would restrict her food choices, believing that only the foods he chose were best for her. This kind of life was supposed to be stressful, but in Gretchen’s eyes, it was Faust’s way of expressing his love for her. So, she chose to stifle her complaints even though she was not truly happy or satisfied.

        “All of this is because Faust loves me too much. It’s my fault that I haven’t given him enough security. Therefore, I must give him more love to put his mind at ease!”

        The kind-hearted Gretchen took the blame for everything despite the fact that it was none of her fault. She even hoped to fulfill Faust’s unreasonable desires by giving more of herself. That was why, from the three dresses she had chosen, she picked the one with a bolder design, hoping to showcase her determination to change for her husband.

        After dressing up and preparing dinner, Gretchen decorated the dining room to create a romantic atmosphere, all in an effort to surprise Faust. However, things turned out to be completely different from what she had expected.

        Creak. It was the sound of the door being opened. Gretchen immediately walked out to greet Faust at the entrance. Her heart pounded as she imagined Faust’s reaction upon seeing her in a different outfit—perhaps he would embrace her with delight or shyly blush. Contrary to her expectation, a deep anger filled Fuast’s eyes the moment he laid eyes on her.

        “Why are you dressed like this?” Faust accused loudly, his tone harsh as if she had committed a heinous and unforgivable crime.

        “I-I… Today is our wedding anniversary, and I wanted to surprise you, so I wore—” Gretchen's words faltered as she saw Faust’s increasingly darkened face. Panicked, she hastily said, “I can go change immediately!”

        “No…” The look on Faust’s face carried both paranoia and madness as he said, “You do resent my control over you after all.”

        “No, that’s not true! Faust, I love you!”

        “But your love for me will fade one day and you’ll betray me, won’t you…” Faust murmured in despair and anguish. His reveal of vulnerability softened Gretchen’s heart, compelling her to rush forward and hold him tightly.

        “No, my dear, I swear on my soul that I will love you forever, and my love for you will never fade.”

        “...Do you mean it?”  Faust held Gretchen in his arms, gazing at her bright eyes with deep affection and fear. “Can I trust you? Will you still love me forever even if I do something horrible to you?”

        “Of course, I will gladly accept what you do to me, as long as it’s you.”

        “Gretchen…” Deeply moved by Gretchen’s confession of love, Faust passionately kissed her lips. On that day, Gretchen, in an attempt to showcase her love, was even more inclined to tolerate  Faust’s rough and domineering behavior than usual. She believed that she had successfully convinced Faust of her love. Little did she know that it was all just an illusion.

        The next day, when Gretchen returned home from the market with groceries, she was rendered unconscious by Blair. By the time she regained consciousness, her soul had been trapped within a gem, in which she vaguely heard Faust’s whisper of obsession, “Gretchen, now you will forever belong to me, and you’ll never leave me again…”</p>
