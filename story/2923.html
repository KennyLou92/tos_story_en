        <h1>Omniscient Revealer - Yog-Sothoth</h1>
        <p>
                Confined in the void, Yog-Sothoth had no choice but to divert the elements continuously to the realm of gods under the orders of  Zeus. Occasionally, she fell into a peaceful slumber when fatigue set in after constantly using her powers. While her senses were immersed in the darkness, the elements created an illusion, showing her the alternate reality where she could have made a different choice…

        ‘Day after day, year after year. How boring,’ Yog-Sothoth yawned while playing with the magic cube in her hands. She had grown weary of her never-ending and desultory days in the void; now she yearned for something engaging.

        It was not until one day that she learned from Hades that the gods were the main reason for the continual decrement of elemental power. It turned out that the gods had instructed the humans to build the Enochian Tower, a device designed to absorb the elements in the realm of humans so that they could rebuild the realm of gods. Hades left with a sly grin after bringing her the news.

        Yog-Sothoth was perfectly aware of Hades’ intention—he wanted her help to take down Zeus, and indeed, he had successfully sent ripples through her tediously uneventful life…

        “Creating the realm of gods with elemental powers… What a horrific thought. But why haven’t they made any progress after collecting so many elements—” Suddenly, the void shook. Yog-Sothoth hastened to check, only to see Zeus, accompanied by the other gods, at the entrance of the void, wreaking havoc as they pleased. Several staircases and walls had been reduced to dust because of them.

        “Darn it, Zeus! Watch! I’ll trap you in my maze forever!” Yog-Sothoth’s hands were ready to twist her magic cube. However, a sudden thought flashed through her mind and stopped her. ‘I wonder what the elements they’ve collected are for… And perhaps I can use that power for my own…’

        Changing her mind, Yog-Sothoth twisted the magic cube to connect her room to where Zeus and his party stood.

        “Zeus, is this how the Holy Gods greet others, by vandalizing their houses?” Yog-Sothoth looked down at the uninvited guests. Her gaze gave a sense of innate supremacy; the gods could not help but feel fear in her inexplicably dominating presence that stemmed from the power of the origin.

        “You are as formidable as the legends suggest, Yog-Sothoth the ancient demon,”  Zeus, as the King of Gods, fearlessly met Yog-Sothoth’s gaze with a proud stance and asked, “I presume you’ve already learned of our plans from Hades, correct?” 

        “Indeed I have. It’s quite an intriguing plan. However, your plan will not work if you do not know how to guide the elements and transform them,” Yog-Sothoth said.

        “That’s why we need your help,” Zeus said. Despite his respectful and courteous tone, his eyes belied his disdain and insincerity.

        “It’s such an ironic way to put it when you know you are not giving me a chance to say no,” Yog-Sothoth sneered, dismantling Zeus’s benevolent facade without mercy.

        “You’ll suffer less as long as you cooperate with us,” Zeus decisively dropped his act and said while arrogantly lifting his chin.

        “Ha, how nice of you,” Yog-Sothoth gave a derisive laugh. “Zeus, tell me, who sent you here today?”

        “...What are you talking about? I am the King of Gods. No one can tell me what to do,” Zeus said composedly. Yet, the hint of unease that flickered across his face betrayed his pretense.

        “You can’t lie in front of me. I know you can’t control that enormous amount of elements alone. So it couldn’t be you who came up with that plan; it must be someone more powerful than you,” Yog-Sothoth said while surveying the other gods who all looked bewildered. Realizing the incongruity, she continued with a knowing smirk, “But I can help you defeat that person, free you from their constraint.”

        “Humph! Nonsense!” Zeus’s expression changed. He waved his hand vigorously as if he was trying to deny what Yog-Sothoth said. “Since you didn’t attack us today, we shall leave and let you make up your mind. I will return in three days. I expect a positive answer from you, or we will be forced to make you suffer once more.”

        Zeus and the other gods then left, leaving Yog-Sothoth alone in the void. However, instead of feeling anxious or frustrated, Yog-Sothoth remained calm.

        ‘No one can resist freedom. He, Zeus, will surely come back and beg for my help.’ She thought with a confident smile playing on her lips.

        As she expected, Zeus came to the void alone three days later to see Yog-Sothoth. Surprisingly, Zeus seemed much more humble and prudent compared with the haughty demeanor he had shown in their last meeting.

        “Are you certain you can defeat the person behind me?” Zeus asked.

        “Of course, I am an ancient demon born from the power of the primordial dragon of destruction. With the power I’m given, I can have any existence in the palm of my hand,”  Yog-Sothoth extended a hand toward Zeus as she whispered the most tempting words, “Come, work with me, and I shall grant you unparalleled power and freedom.”

        Ultimately, Zeus yielded to the overwhelming temptation and accepted Yog-Sothoth’s invitation, joining forces to take down the mastermind behind him—Khaos.

        Yog-Sothoth severed a part of herself and created a worm that had its own mind. She then asked Zeus to plant the worm on Khaos. As time passed, the worm nibbled away at Khaos’ will, eventually turning him into a puppet that would act as she pleased.

        “Hail to the Queen.” Taking the lead, Zeus dropped on one knee. All the other gods followed suit, prostrating themselves as Yog-Sothoth entered the hall in the new realm of gods. Seated on the throne, she looked at her subjects with a contented smile.

        “Now it’s time to build my kingdom.”

        “I will not follow anyone’s script; I submit to no one!”</p>
