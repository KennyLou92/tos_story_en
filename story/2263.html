        <h1>Upstanding Retributor - Lu Xun</h1>
        <p>Imperial Heroes - The Finishing Battle Ch.10

        Lu Xun found out about the demon-possessed Cao Cao after communicating with Zhang Jue’s spirit. Unfortunately, Cao Cao had already ascended to the throne. When he was running out of solutions to eliminate the demon, he received the news about Sun Quan’s recruitment. With the help of Armadillo and Zheng, he passed the test and successfully got hired by Sun Quan.

        Since then, Lu Xun had been assigned to work for Zhou Yu. His harmless look made him an excellent intel collector, and also a middle man for Sun Quan. But all these things never helped him in tracking the demon. As time went by, he started worrying about his progress.

        Later on, his opportunity finally arrived. On a usual reporting day, Lu Xun ran into a robust man during the visit to Sun Quan.

        “The warship is ready. We can set sail to intercept Cao Cao anytime,” Gan Ning the robust man said confidently to Zhou Yu and Sun Quan.

        “WHAT?”

        Gan Ning’s words triggered Lu Xun, who barged into the room regardless of manners.

        “Are you guys going to battle Cao Cao?” Lu Xun asked.

        Shocked by the sudden interruption, Gan Ning asked Zhou Yu and Sun Quan, “whose bastard son is he?”

        “Neither,” Zhou Yu refuted affirmatively. He came to Lu Xun, patted his head and said, “this is Lu Xun, a talented boy we’ve recruited. He has been collecting intel for us.”

        “All thanks to me and Zheng!” Armadillo yelled at Zhou Yu’s face, but the man heard nothing at all, for no one could see Armadillo and Zheng but Lu Xun.

        “It’s not the time for a small talk. Since the fleet is ready, we should set off as soon as possible before we miss the chance to capture Cao Cao,” said Sun Quan.

        As Sun Quan stood up, Zhou Yu and Gan Ning put away their causal face and made their moves. At this moment, Lu Xun blocked the way.

        “What happened exactly? Didn’t we just form an alliance? Why are you suddenly off to catch Cao Cao?”

        When Lu Xun raised the question, Zhou Yu and Sun Quan looked at each other speechlessly. After a moment of silence, Sun Quan began to explain.

        “After the ally meeting with Liu Bei and Lü Bu, Liu Bei ran into Cao’s army and figured out his plan to raid Lü Bu. So he notified us for backup. Much as we want to help, it takes time for our army to deploy. That’s why we sent a strike team to rescue, and now our army is ready.”

        “Cao Cao wouldn’t expect our quick response, so this is gonna be a good opportunity to raid him,” Zhou Yu further explained, waving his feather fan.

        “I want to go with you!” Lu Xun shouted.

        “This...This is nothing like gathering intels. Much more dangerous,” Zhou Yu tried to talk him down, but Lu Xun responded determinedly, “I’m not afraid of it!”

        “Haha. This kid got some balls. I like him. Let’s bring him with us!” Gan Ning laughed loudly. 

        “If you say so,” Sun Quan reluctantly agreed with a sigh.

        “Xun, don’t eat too much later,” Zhou Yu whispered at Lu Xun, who was perplexed at first. He got the meaning later on.

        “BLAAARRGGGHH——!” 

        Lu Xun jumped out of the ship as soon as it docked, throwing up badly in the bushes.

        “That topless man sailed way too fast! I thought we were gonna get thrown overboard!” Armadillo complained while Zheng was caring for Lu Xun’s well-being. 

        Lu Xun felt a lot better after the vomit. Next second, a deafening roar sounded from the shore across the woods.

        “This scent…” Apart from the roar, Lu Xun also sniffed a strong scent of demon.

        “It’s that demon! I won’t get this scent wrong!” All the hairs on Armadillo stood up out of alert.

        “Finally found you!” 

        Running through the woods, Lu Xun arrived the shore where the roar came from, and he was instantly stunned by what he saw——

        Countless soldiers were lying dead on the shore, while a disfigured monster stood at the center. The blood on its hands implied that it was responsible for the carnage.

        “What...What the heck is this thing…” Lu Xun asked quietly, trying hard not to quiver.

        “Someone made a deal with the demon to obtain a destructive power in exchange for the body…” Zheng deduced.

        “But that person isn’t Cao Cao!” Lu Xun pointed at that disfigured monster, who could still be identified as a female with long hair.

        “Humph! Something must have happened after Zhang Jue’s death. The demon was transferred to someone else!” Armadillo grumbled.

        Dense footsteps sounded behind Lu Xun. Turned out Sun Quan and the troops chased Lu Xun to this place. 

        “Liu Bei! Lü Bu!”

        The moment Sun Quan arrived, he saw Liu Bei’s soldiers and Lü Bu’s soldiers standing at both sides of the shore respectively. All were wounded.

        Meanwhile, the monster approached Liu Bei’s side. When the wounded Guan Yu barely raised her Crescent Blade, she got swept away by the monster immediately. The danger was threatening them.

        “It’s not the time to study it. Gotta immobilize it first!”

        With his eyes closed, Lu Xun chanted a spell by making a chain of hand gestures. Next second, chains made of green light rose from the ground under the monster’s feet, tying it up.

        “ROAR!” The monster bulked as it roared, breaking free the chains. Then it turned around to stare at Lu Xun.

        “It’s you...That crappy old man’s apprentice...Hahaha! Excellent...I gotta give you a painful torture this time to vent my anger!”

        The monster took a strong leap, bouncing all the way to Lu Xun like a ferocious vulture. In the blink of an eye, its huge fist was about to bash into his head——

        “Whoa!”

        Lu Xun only knew that someone carried him away from the attack, which was a close call.

        “S-Sun Quan!”

        “Hey, what is going on here? You know that monster? Why is it after you?” Sun Quan asked while carrying Lu Xun to run. Turning around, he saw the monster chasing them.

        “Umm...I have a history with that monster,” said Lu Xun. Then he continued grimly, “I must eliminate it!”

        “It’s impossible. You’re just a boy after all!”

        “I can!” Lu Xun slit his wrist to bleed and shouted, “Armadillo, Zheng, here you go!”

        “Haha! It’s our showtime!” Armadillo and Zheng started gulping his blood. Next second, the two beast fused into one!

        “Go! Engulf the spirit of that demon!” Lu Xun commanded.

        “Roger!” Receiving the order, the magnificent beast sprinted to the demon in a split second, subduing it with its huge paw. The beast then leant close to mumble, “you evil spirit bewitch humans to slaughter innocent lives. Now, repent your sins with death!”

        The beast ripped the demon off from its host with a bite, swallowing it down to eliminate it.

        “Master...I accomplished your last wish…”

        Losing too much blood, Lu Xun fainted after giving a smile of relief, which also made him unaware that the host of that demon was still alive...
