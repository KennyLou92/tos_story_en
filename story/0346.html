        <h1>Princess of Kolchis</h1>
        <p>        Since Medea was small, she had been very talented in magic for each of her fiery spells is impressive.  She moved with a fiery grace; her beauty reminiscent of angels in heaven.  She was adored by all the men in the kingdom.  Yet, Medea was obsessed with magic only and gave no thought to love and romance...

        A team of adventurers from the outside had executed the king’s order and had just received their bounty in the Palace.  The reward was so extraordinary that it had become the talk of the town.  Medea’s maid had been worried that she would be consumed by her love of magic, so she discreetly brought Medea out to the town for a stroll.  Secretly, she had also self-indulgently hoped to steal a look at the latest superstar of the city— Jason, the strongest warrior of the adventure team. 

        Her face hidden by a handkerchief, Medea and her maid got closer and closer to Jason in the guise of dancers.  Jason finally stopped conversing with his friends to enjoy the dance when Medea and him were just two paces away.  At that moment, they looked into each other’s eyes... 

        Medea’s face was burning hot as if Jason had cast a fiery spell on her.  She did not know whether it was because she had never taken a serious look at a man, or because she was charmed by his charisma.  After that night, Medea had started longing for Jason.  Her affection for him grew stronger and stronger, and at last she even requested the king to use a martial tournament to choose a spouse for her.

        When Jason learned from the maid that the dancer he had loved at first sight was Medea, he decided to disregard his friends’ opposition and  join the tournament.  As Medea predicted, Jason easily defeated all the nobles, earning the chance to marry the princess. However, the king broke his word and opposed their marriage because Jason was only a commoner.  This enraged Medea insisted upon marrying Jason, further drawing the king's ire.  He compelled Jason’s imprisonment.  Medea was tormented by the longing for him since they parted. Finally, she could bear it no more and broke into the jail at night. She rescued Jason and eloped with him.  Although there were hindrances during the escape, Medea was so determined that nothing could stop her. 

        The next day, the people were looking for Jason and Medea. Instead of finding the missing couple, they found a charred body of the centaur who had been burnt to death...</p>
