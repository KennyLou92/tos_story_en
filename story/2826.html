        <h1>Flag of Purification - Jiang Ziya</h1>
        <p>
                In the Heavenly Kingdom, a male Xian was riding a spotted tiger, galloping across the sky. With his sleeves fluttering in the wind and sparks of electricity running along the whip on his waist, he looked so unfettered and majestic that other Xians went around lest they stood in his way.

        The male Xian, Shen Gongbao, went all the way to a Xian’s residence. Without asking for the owner’s permission, he pushed open the door and walked into the house while shouting wantonly, ‘Brother! I’ve mastered a new technique! Come practice with me— Is he away from home again?’

        Shen Gongbao was plunged into disappointment when he walked to the study where he didn’t see Jiang Ziya. Perhaps because of the great discontent, he failed to notice a little fox that was watching him secretly in the dark.

        It was Daji, a vixen that had been saved by Jiang Ziya. By then, she was gritting her teeth while thinking spitefully, “Darn it! It’s the annoying Shen Gongbao again… Jiang Shang wouldn’t have gone to the human world and left me alone in the house if it wasn’t for him… Ugh! I have to find a way to get rid of him, or else Jiang Shang won’t have much time to be with me.”

        As Daji turned her brilliant eyes, an idea popped up in her mind. Soon after she mustered her power, the little fox turned into Jiang Ziya in an instant. Then, ‘he’ walked to Shen Gongbao, who was still searching around the room, from a dark corner.

        ‘Since Brother isn’t here, I guess I’ll just come back tomorrow— Brother!’Shen Gongbao’s eyes lit up as he saw ‘Jiang Ziya’. He immediately stepped forward and said excitedly, ‘So you are at home! Great! Let’s have a duel now!’

        ‘Brother, I’m sorry but I’m caught up in something more important, so please forgive me for turning down your invitation.’ 

        Daji’s incredible acting successfully fooled Shen Gongbao into believing that he was rejected by his Brother again, which frustrated him.

        ‘That excuse again… You’re always caught up in something whenever I ask you to practice with me. Just say it! Just say that you despise me and you don’t think I’m good enough to be your opponent!’

        ‘Brother, please don’t say that. You are extremely talented and I’m sure you will achieve great things. It’s just that I have  gotten too much on my plate.’

        ‘I’m happy to help you as long as you promise to have a duel with me!’

        ‘That helps a lot! The apricot flag was damaged in the fight with the elves a few days ago, and I need a hundred Phoenix Feathers to repair it. Brother, could you please help me get the feathers?’

        ‘A piece of cake!’ Shen Gongbao rode his tiger away after leaving those words.

        When the real Jiang Ziya went back to his residence and saw the gloating Daji, he couldn’t help but ask her curiously, ‘Why are you so happy?’

        ‘I’ve just solved a big problem for you.’ And so, Daji told Jiang Ziya about Shen Gongbao’s visit. ‘The Phoenix Feathers are hard to find so that should be able to keep him away from you for a few days.’

        Unexpectedly, Jiang Ziya didn’t burst into laughter. Instead, he scolded Daji severely, ‘Nonsense! It’s now the hatching season of the Phoenixes. Whoever breaks into their territory will be attacked by the clan! That’s way too much for a prank!’

        ‘I-I didn’t know! Don’t yell at me! I only did this for you!’ Distressed by Jiang Ziya’s harsh reprimand, Daji couldn’t help but stomp her feet, then she turned back into a fox and left.

        “This happens because of Ziya so Ziya has to fix it!”

        Riding his mystical pet, Sibuxiang, Jiang Ziya hurried to the Phoenixes' territory, only to find his Brother surrounded by a group of Phoenixes and covered with wounds halfway through.

        Since the Phoenixes were a kind of mystical creature in the Heavenly Kingdom, Shen Gongbao did not want to attack them with thunder. That was why he could not break through the siege but only tried his best to protect his body with Xian energy.

        However, the Phoenixes’ attacks only grew fiercer. Just when he was about to lose, dozens of yellow talismans came down from the sky and hit the Phoenixes precisely, causing them to fall to the ground unconscious.

        ‘Run!’ Jiang Ziya shouted.

        Shen Gongbao mounted his tiger and left with Jiang Ziya as soon as he had collected himself. The two later landed by a lake in the forest.

        ‘Brother, what are you doing here?’

        ‘It’s all my fault.’ Jiang Ziya then told Shen Gongbao how Daji had fooled him by disguising herself. Shen Gongbao, of course, was enraged, and he exclaimed, ‘That cunning vixen! How dare she disguises as you and play me!’

        ‘Please forgive me, Brother. I will take Daji with me and make a proper apology to you the other day.’ Jiang Ziya asked for Shen Gongbao’s forgiveness, making a Fist-and-palm salute.

        Soon, Shen Gongbao’s anger slightly subsided. He hesitated for a while before he thanked Jiang Ziya awkwardly with his face tilted away, ‘Well… Thanks. I would have no choice but to kill all the Phoenixes with thunder if you hadn’t rescued me just in time.’

        ‘Brother, it was the least I could do. I had to help you since it is my honor to have a worthy opponent like you.’

        “A worthy opponent… Does it mean he recognizes me?” Shen Gongbao was overjoyed to hear Jiang Ziya’s compliment. With the overwhelming excitement in his chest, he couldn’t help but ask, ‘So Brother, can we have a duel today?’

        ‘...You’re injured and I have used all my power. Let’s call it a day.’ Jiang Ziya rode Shibuxiang into the air and fled as soon as he finished saying those words…
