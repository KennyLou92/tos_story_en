        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 3

        A cool breeze drifted through a cavern and found its way into one of the massive chambers; still, it could not disperse the thick putrid stench lingering within. The chamber was littered with broken wings, shattered armor, and severed limbs; the ground was splattered with blood. Even without a direct view of the carnage, one could still easily piece together the dreadful violence that had happened from the grievous aftermath.

        In the corner of the chamber were several emaciated elves, huddling together, their necks shackled with chains. One of them lay lifeless, while the rest barely clung to life.

        Normally, sleep would elude most in such an unsettling environment. Yet, a giant beast slumbered soundly at the center of the chamber. Its chest rose and fell along with its slow and sonorous breaths, completely undisturbed.

        However, not everyone was indifferent like the peacefully slumbering beast.

        Another beast’s silhouette emerged at the entrance of the chamber. Her brows drew together tightly as the overpowering stench filled her nostrils before she even stepped inside the chamber. Holding her breath, she approached the sleeping beast and gave him a few nudges with her forepaw. However, the beast remained unperturbed. Instead, he rolled onto his side and continued his slumber.

        “Admah, wake up,” the phantocauda, Zoar, implored. Seeing her efforts fail, she intensified her movements, from gentle nudges to vigorous pushes. It was after a while of pushing and shouting that she finally managed to awaken her sleeping brother, Admah.

        “Tut…” Admah’s mood soured as his sleep was disturbed, and he made no effort to hide his annoyance. He clicked his tongue and turned his face, glaring menacingly at Zoar. However, his glare only made Zoar deepen her frown instead of cowering.

        “I was sound asleep. Why did you suddenly wake me up?” Admah impatiently asked.

        “We’re joining forces with the corrodents and the elemental beasts today to vanquish the elves, remember? We’re assigned to deal with the floral-elves,” Zoar explained.

        “Oh, right!” Admah exclaimed, shedding his drowsy demeanor in an instant. With renewed vigor, he leaped to his feet and shouted with excitement, “Yes, yes, yes! How could I forget such an important thing? I’m definitely going to slaughter every single one of those despicable elves who only know to lie in ambush this time!”

        “Now that you’re awake, I’ll go and report to Gomorrah first,” Zoar instructed, “Freshen yourself up and meet us in the hall.”

        “Got it, got it!” Admah responded dismissively. His attention had already shifted to the nearby rack of torture devices. He murmured, “Hmm, which one should I try this time…”

        Seeing her mission accomplished, Zoar turned to leave. She took a few steps before stumbling upon something near her feet, so she lowered her gaze only to discover a shriveled eyeball. As a wave of revulsion washed over her, she could not help but ask, “Admah, must you torture the captives like this? Why not just kill them? What’s the point of torturing them anyway?”

        “Heh, why else? It’s just fun,” Admah retorted. As if he needed to prove a point, he immediately tugged on the chain of a recoiling elf in the corner, eliciting a scream of terror. The elf trembled uncontrollably, his face, with one eye gouged out, displayed nothing but bleak despair and fear.

        “Don’t you see how fun it is to see the terrified look on their faces? It’s the victor’s privilege,” Admah said with a twisted sense of delight.

        “...I can’t understand it, nor can I feel it. I just find it disgusting,” Zoar expressed her inability to comprehend her brother’s unusual hobby, her eyes unable to conceal her disgust.

        “Well. it’s funny because I can’t fathom why you’re so infatuated with that skank Gomorrah either,” Admah retorted, mocking Zoar by piercing her in her sore spot, “She only cares about her precious gladiospina. The way she lets that gladiospina cloud her judgment and the depths she goes to please her just disgust me.”

        Gomorrah was the current chieftain of the phantocaudas, who rose to authority after her father, the former chieftain. Yet, some phantocaudas had questioned her leadership due to her young age while another faction attempted to elevate Admah to the top position. However, Gomorrah defeated Admah in a duel where they fought for the throne, leaving Admah with an unforgettable humiliation and a permanent scar on one of his tails. Ever since then, Admah held a deep resentment for Gomorrah and continued to belittle and trouble her with different excuses. 

        “You—” Admah’s vulgar remarks left Zoar speechless with rage.

        “I don’t care what you think,” Admah said, his sharp gaze fixed upon Zoar, causing her chest to tighten momentarily, “But, if I ever find out you betray me, even if you’re my sister, I will hunt you down!”

        Admah, who knew his warning had made an impact, raised his chin and said, “Now, get out and find your dear Gomorrah. Keep your nose where it belongs.”

        After resentfully glaring at Admah for a moment, Zoar eventually huffed in displeasure and walked away, leaving Admah alone in the chamber.

        Admah shook his mane, stretched, and flexed his muscles. After squinting his eyes, he coiled his tail around the torture devices and lifted them all.

        “Forget it, I’ll just bring them all!” Admah, as arrogant and reckless as ever, then set off with his fellow phantocaudas, carrying an air of pride as they made their way to the forest where the floral-elves were hiding.

        Without waiting for Gomorrah’s command, Admah charged ahead into the depths of the forest. It did not take long for him to discover a floral-elf hiding behind a large rock. With a flick of his tail, he captured the elf before she could escape.

        “Hahaha! Found one already, what a piece of cake!” Admah burst into hearty laughter while bringing the elf, whose face was filled with fear and tears, captured in his tail close to him.

        Instead of ending the elf’s life immediately, Admah displayed great patience, intending to experiment with each of the torture devices he brought, one by one, on her body. Unfortunately, the elf died miserably before he could finish his first trial.

        “Tut!” Admah flicked his tail in frustration, venting his displeasure as he carelessly threw the nearly deformed corpse to the ground. “How useless. But it doesn’t matter. I’ll just find another one.”

        And so, Admah began his brutal cycle of torture and slaughter—capturing floral-elves, torturing them to death, discarding their bodies, and then seeking out new victims.

        In no time, numerous terrifying corpses sprawled across the forest. Yet, Admah was still not satisfied. Instead, he got carried away, losing himself to the intoxicating exhilaration and vanity of becoming an absolute predator. His mind became clouded, and thus he failed to react when the danger drew near.

        Fortunately, a beast came in the nick of time and pushed him away.

        Boom!

        A mighty sword plunged into the ground like a falling star, stirring up a fierce gust of wind. Sharp stones and coarse sand were scattered in all directions, leaving wounds on the two phantocaudas and drenching their fur in vivid crimson.

        Countless imposing dragons descended from the sky. Hovering in mid-air, they looked down at the phantocaudas. As the most majestic one in the lead flew forward, the sword struggled free from the ground and sheathed itself back into the dragon’s back.

        “You ruthless phantocaudas, you have defied the peaceful covenant of the seven races, invading the abode of innocent elves and slaughtering them. I, Gram the gladiospina, and my kin will not stand such a gruesome act! If you dare to harm the weak again, we will stop you!” the dragon proclaimed.

        “So you’re the bastard who ambushed me! I—” shouted Admah, who attempted to retaliate, but someone stopped him from behind— it was the phantocauda who had saved him earlier, Gomorrah, the current chieftain.

        “Calm down! The situation is unfavorable now; we must retreat!” Gomorrah cautioned.

        “So we just let them win like this?!”

        “Or we let you act recklessly and end up in an even more humiliating defeat?” Gomorrah’s words hit Admah right in his sore point. As someone who valued his pride above everything, the last thing Admah wanted would be a devastating defeat. The gladiospinas’ attack was not something the phantocaudas had anticipated, and engaging in a confrontation would only leave them in a disadvantageous position, so retreating would definitely be a wiser choice.

        “Tut!” Admah clicked his tongue in frustration. Suppressing the surging bloodlust within his heart, he turned and swiftly fled.

        ‘Next time, I’ll have my revenge and wipe away this shameful defeat!’</p>
