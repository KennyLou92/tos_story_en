        <h1>Toxiflaring Pedipalps - Alma</h1>
        <p>
                The night fell upon the remote town as usual, but tonight, the darkness brought an unsettling disturbance. Countless wicked creatures lurked in the shadows, their bloodthirsty eyes fixated on the peaceful town, ready to give the people a sanguinary nightmare.

        In a house nestled in a corner of the town, Alma, a little girl sleeping in her bedroom on the second floor, was awakened by some strange noises. Rubbing her groggy eyes, she sat up and called out softly, “Dad? Mom?”

        However, Alma heard no response from her parents. Instead, the disturbing noises downstairs grew louder. Alma walked out of her room, holding the handmade doll her father had crafted for her. The noises became clear and unobstructed, and the air was filled with a scent the little girl disliked.

        “Dad?” Alma paused for a moment before calling out again, “Mom?”

        “No… Alma… Don’t come down…” The voice was faint but Alma still recognized that it was his father immediately. A strong sense of unease crept up on her. Ignoring her father’s warning, she descended the stairs in her slippers, only to witness a horrifying spectacle at the moment her feet touched the floor. The doll slipped from her hands and fell to the floor as she let out a piercing scream, “Nooooooo—! Dad… Mom… No…NO!”

        “Grrr…” A gigantic scorpion-like monster turned its head as it heard the scream. With it standing in the living room, the once spacious space was now crammed. Its two massive pincers were dripping with blood. Alma’s beloved father lay weakly against a wall with a gaping wound in his left abdomen, while her mother whose right body had been torn apart lay motionless in a pool of blood.

        Despite the fatal injuries, the two parents struggled to move their damaged bodies upon seeing the monster walk toward Alma, summoning their last ounce of strength to shout to their daughter—

        “Alma! Run!”
        “Run and don’t look back!”

        However, the young Alma was paralyzed with fear by the gory scene before her. Her body went weak, and she could only silently watch as the gigantic monster slowly approached her with its wide mouth opened, emitting a putrid stench of savage desire.

        The monster raised its blood-stained pincers again, intending to tear apart the fragile little girl just like it had done to her parents. Yet, its vile wish went unfulfilled as two figures charged toward Alma, pushing her away and taking the brunt of the pincers for her.

        “Mom… Mom…” Alma murmured, trembling and huddling within the space created by her parents’ bodies. The blood dripping from their bodies stained her face red.

        “It… It’s okay… Mom and Dad…will protect you…” Despite the excruciating pain, Alma’s mother forced a smile and comforted her terrified daughter.

        “That’s right… Alma… Sweetie… Close your eyes… The nightmare will be over soon…”

        Alma listened to her father’s words and closed her eyes. Then she the dull sounds of something sharp stabbing a human’s flesh, one after another, repeatedly. To spare Alma from fear, her parents swallowed their agonizing screams of pain, only letting out a few stifled groans. It was until the two could no longer make a sound that the monster finally gave up its hunt for Alma and left the house.

        The little Alma had no clue that the monster had left, nor could she perceive the death of her parents. She simply closed her eyes and curled up in her own world, shutting off all of her senses, until someone carried her out from her parent’s cold bodies. As the sudden warmth scorched her numb soul, she abruptly opened her eyes. Tears immediately streamed down her face, yet she could barely produce a sound but only wept in silence.

        “Oh… Poor child…” The man sighed softly, holding Alma in his arms. Standing beside him was a beautiful cerapter.

        “Prometheus, what should we do with her,” asked the cerapter.

        “We’re always on the move, so we can’t take this girl with us. The only thing we can do is find a family in the nearby town and let them take care of her.”

        Afterward, Prometheus found a kind elderly couple for Alma, who treated the little girl as their own. They raised her into adulthood and passed away peacefully. Once again bereaved, still, Alma never forgot the hatred she held for her parents’ murderer, which eventually became the reason for her joining the gods’ army.</p>
