        <h1>Absolute Authoritarian - Baal</h1>
        <p>        “Come, Baal. Look at our kingdom.”

        The king led his young son Baal to the balcony for a bird’s-eye view of their kingdom. What Baal saw back then was a vital and energetic world.

        But shortly after that, the vitality of the kingdom drained. Plants withered even though they used to flourish. The ocean which had once been lifeful was now uninhabited, the fertile soil barren. 

        The king was so anxious to help the suffering people that he ventured to implement unrealistic policies in spite of objections, which only worsened matters. In the end, the seven aristocrats in power no longer trusted the royal family.

        The aristocrats might seem obedient, but in secrecy they were obsessed with power. They established slavery to consolidate their own class by exploiting others. The royal family declined as time went by. An age in which the aristocracy overpowered royalty began. 

        Growing up in such disparity, Baal’s respect for his father lessened after his political failure. But deep down, he still held his father in high regard until the annual meeting of the Protodemons, when the seven aristocrats were meant to come to the palace and have a discussion with the king.

        However, the aristocrats boycotted the meeting for different reasons. Their absence had apparently irritated the king, who beat his loyal servant for relief.

        The despicable action of the king filled Baal with disgust and contempt as he stood next to the throne and witnessed everything. Despite his rank as a noble of the royal family, the king didn’t reflect on the mistakes that he had made nor tried to find ways to turn the tide. Instead, he was in denial about the status quo and threw a tantrum in such a disgraceful way.  

        Observing how foolish and useless his father was, Baal made a decision.

        “I am the only one who can revive the glory of the royal family and step onto the dominant throne.”

        To overthrow the corrupted aristocracy, the first thing Baal did was to send his brother Belial away from the battlefield. Baal didn’t do it just to protect his sibling, it was also a plan against the aristocracy— Even if Baal was killed by them, Belial would remain as a legitimate heir to the throne.

        This was how “Pioneers” came about. After sending Belial away, Baal started preparing for his plan. Lacking military power and resources, he went to Eve the grand duchess, who had the most frivolous reputation among the aristocrats.

        Persuaded by Baal, the two married each other and Eve transferred all of her power to him. With authority, bringing the rebellious aristocrats under control was but a piece of cake to Baal.

        The capture of other aristocrats alerted their leader, who immediately sought allies from the remaining aristocrats to stop Baal’s schemes.

        “I shall be able to defeat them with my current power, but the prize for my victory would be a war-torn country.”

        Just when Baal was nonplussed, he came— Laplace, the demon from the ancient times who possessed prodigious power, was here to assist Baal by crushing the aristocracy with minimum force. Baal then reallocated the aristocratic resources to help the people and restore the authority of the royal family.

        Baal was hailed by the public as his father passed away “coincidentally” at the same time. Naturally, Baal was the one who ascended to the throne. Standing in the grand hall during his enthronement, he observed the joyful crowd. 

        “So this is what you get for victory.” A proud, haughty grin spread over Baal’s face.  

        Baal had always been pursuing pleasure on his own. He preferred going into the wild for hunting rather than sitting in the palace and waiting for tributes.

        “Now it’s time to conquer him.” Baal hid his smile and returned to the palace. Striding to the end of the corridor, he entered the bedroom.

        There he was, standing on the starlit balcony— Laplace, the young, handsome man who took Baal’s breath away, the demon from the ancient times.

        Sitting on the railing, Laplace stuck up his fair, slender legs. The way he held a glass of dew between his fingers carried a natural look of mellowness and seductiveness.

        “Congratulations, we can now carry out our plans.” Laplace toasted Baal, who grabbed his hand and downed the glass. 

        “Thanks to your help.” Baal refilled the glass with some crimson liquid that resembled the color of blood.

        “Hmm, I did make some predictions, but you wouldn’t be able to succeed if you weren’t so adroit. Not only did you succeed, but you did it so flawlessly that you exceeded my expectation.” Laplace took a sip of dew, which dyed his lips red. He looked unbelievably alluring.

        “If you say so, do me a favor.” Baal requested in a low voice.

        Laplace smiled cunningly with a shrug, “Fair enough, go on.”

        “Give me a kiss.”

        “... Are you kidding me?”

        “No… Or is it that you’re scared?” said Baal tauntingly.

        “Shush.” Upon the utterance of the word, Laplace came infinitely close to Baal. Pulling Baal’s sleeve, Laplace tipped his toes and stuck even closer. They were so intimate that they could feel the breath of each other. But before their lips met, Laplace turned away with an artful smile. His long eyelashes caressed Baal’s cheek and retreated, leaving his face burning.

        “We’ll talk about that after our plans are carried out.” said Laplace, looking so innocent in his smile that Baal could hardly wait to tame him. Staring at Laplace as he took leave, a burning desire filled Baal’s heart. 

        “Someday, I will own you, even the parts of you that you’ve not yet recognized.”</p>
