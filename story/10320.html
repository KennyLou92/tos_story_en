        <h1>Prodigious Wizardry - Cilovic</h1>
        <p>Date of Birth: 12 Dec

The descendant of Enoch the savior and Ingrid the great witch.
He is the current Chief of Heptara Unies Department of Security, responsible for governing all Summoners. 

Born with extraordinary magic power and excellent magic talents, he can master any kind of magic formula easily. In addition to that,  he has considerable experience and remarkable skills in fighting, which makes him an all-rounded fighter.

Having a rather spontaneous personality, he does things his own way. For his head is filled with different crazy ideas, he often gives others a sense of immaturity, but he is actually a very visionary and open-minded man who has everything under control.</p>
