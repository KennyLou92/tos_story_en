        <h1>Boar-hearted Rescuer - Zhu Bajie</h1>
        <p>        One day, Zhu Bajie, Tang Sanzang, and the other three apprentices came to Mingnan Mountain on their ascetic journey. When they reached the foot of the mountain, two women reeked of undesirable odors suddenly appeared and took them all aback.

        Pinching his nose, Sun Wukong asked the women, “What monsters are you?! I won’t let you take away our master!”

        “Wukong, calm down. They are not our enemies,” said Tang Sanzang, who pressed down the Vajra Staff in Sun Wukong’s hands.

        “Wukong? So you’re that monkey our master mentioned before?” One of the women asked.

        “You know me?”

        “Sure we do. We are the apprentices of Yuanshi Tianzun. I’m Jiutian Xuannü, the most beautiful Xian in the Heavenly Kingdom, and she is He Xian'gu, an old lady,” said the other woman.


        “Who did you just call an old lady?! Don’t listen to this narcissistic woman! I’m He Xian'gu and I never age.”

        Standing on the side, Zhu Bajie sized up the two women—both of them were soaked to the skin, with unknown thick brown liquid all over their hair and clothes. For their not-very-Xian-like appearances, Zhu Bajie couldn’t help but ask, “Are you really the apprentices of Yuanshi Tianzun? You don’t quite seem so…”

        “I’m glad you asked. It just makes me so mad! When Jiutian Xuannü and I passed by this mountain, we heard that there was a group of brigands who had been capturing people and forcing them to make pig food, so we thought we should bring the brigands to justice and save those innocent people. Little did we know that those barbarous pigs would attack us with pig feces and urine the moment we stepped into their base, leaving us no time to use Xian arts but to run away!”

        “So the odors from your bodies are all because of their attacks?” asked Sha Seng.

        “Yes! My Peach Essence is now completely ruined!” Jiutian Xuannü answered through clamped teeth.

        Clenching her hand into a fist, He Xian'gu added resentfully, “I will make those hateful pigs pay if it’s the last thing I do!”

        Zhu Bajie suddenly felt a chill down his spine, giving him goosebumps. Even though he knew that He Xian'gu wasn’t talking about him, he couldn’t help relating himself to the brigands.

        And then, Tang Sanzang asked, “Is there any way we can help you dispel the brigands? We’ll gladly do so if you need our help.”

        There was no way He Xian'gu and Jiutian Xuannü would ever take another step into the brigands’ base since they were traumatized by those repulsive pigs’ attacks. But how could they capture the brigand chief without venturing into the pigs’ lair? 

        Suddenly, an idea flashed across He Xian'gu’s mind. 

        “Oh right! I heard that the chief is looking for a pig husband. We can take advantage of that and sneak into their base!”

        “A pig husband?”

        Saying that in unison, Sun Wukong, Sha Seng, and Qiongqi looked at Zhu Bajie at the same time.

        “We have one right here.” Lifting its paw, Qiongqi pointed at Zhu Bajie. The latter immediately shook his head and said, “No! I’m not a pig now. I’m still stuck in my human form!”


        Zhu Bajie had turned into a good-looking man after drinking the demonic elixir in the gourd of Golden Horned and Silver Horned. Missing his handsome pig face, he had kept searching for a way to return to his true form ever since.

        “No problem! Leave it to me!” With a smile, Jiutian Xuannü took a porcelain bottle from her sleeve and said, “Ta-da! The true-self potion! This is a potion I made with the celestial essence and Peach Essence which can turn any monsters back to their true forms once they take a sip of it!”

        “Really?” Zhu Bajie took the bottle dubiously.

        “Humph! She may be dumb but she’s got some real talents in making potions. So just take a sip.” Reluctantly,  He Xian'gu defended Jiutian Xuannü.

        “Don’t worry. I will take you to Yuanshi Tianzun and seek vengeance if anything happens.”

        Hearing Sun Wukong’s promise, Zhu Bajie let down his guard and drank the potion. Just as promised, his body turned back into a boar under a white light in less than a second.

        Overjoyed, Zhu Bajie rushed to the river to check whether his handsome face was the same as before. However, he soon lowered his head in dejection after two glances.

        Sha Seng, who sensed his gloomy mood, asked, “What’s wrong? Shouldn’t you be happy that you’re finally back in your true form?”

        Zhu Bajie looked at his plump jawline and his pot belly that was about to touch the ground. He sighed, “Oink, I feel like I’m no longer the hottest pig.”

        “It’s okay! I know how to fix it!” He Xian'gu took a set of armor out of nowhere and put it on Zhu Bajie to cover his huge belly. Then, everyone helped Zhu Bajie polish the armor and his fangs. They combed his fur and put a ribbon on him, turning him into a handsome boar.


        Seeing his heroic reflection in the water, Zhu Bajie snorted proudly and said in a high spirit, “Oink! Oink! Now I’m ready to be a groom!”

        In order to lower the guard of the pigs in the brigand cottage, they decided to let Zhu Bajie go in alone while the rest stayed outside and waited for the best moment.

        As soon as the armored Zhu Bajie stepped into the cottage, he shouted to the pigs, “I'm here to marry the chief!”

        At the shout, all the brigand pigs looked back and they were instantly mesmerized by Zhu Bajie’s charms. They voluntarily made way for him and some pigs even offered to lead the way.

        Soon Zhu Bajie was brought to the chief’s room. Sitting on a large chair covered with white rabbit fur was the chief who was dressed in a glittery, rhinestoned and little dress with a golden ruby-jeweled headband on its head. With its whole body sparkling brilliantly, it kind of matched Zhu Bajie’s look.

        Seeing the chief’s back, Zhu Bajie couldn't help but think that it must be an exquisite pig lady and it might be wonderful if he could marry her.

        The maid pig, who was waving a banana fan beside the chief, said softly, “Chief, your suitor is here.”

        “Oink. Wonderful! Finally, someone came.”

        A sudden premonition rose in Zhu Bajie’s heart when he heard the chief’s voice. Why does the chief’s voice sound so deep and husky?
        Just then, the chief, who had been sitting with their back toward Zhu Bajie, sprang up from their seat and threw themself on Zhu Bajie. As its face expanded before Zhu Bajie’s eyes, the latter finally had a clearer look only to find that it was a boar!

        Zhu Bajie's dream was crushed. Thrown into a state of shock, he tried to escape, but the chief had already held his body tightly while gazing at him up close. The chief said, “Yes! Finally, a handsome one! Let me spoil you with a lot of love!”


        “Woah! You’re a man?!”
        
        “I never said I’m a girl!” 
  
        “But I’m a man too!” 

        “A man is exactly what I’m looking for! My guards at the door would have stopped you the other way! Come on, baby! Give me a kiss!” Pushing out its lips, the chief tried to give Zhu Bajie several kisses.

        Finding the chief unbearable, Zhu Bajie kicked it away, and then he ran away immediately. However, the chief didn’t take no for an answer but chased after Zhu Bajie, shouting, “Don’t run away from me! My dear!”

        Nauseated by the chief’s words, Zhu Bajie kept dashing forward, kicking away all the pigs standing in his way. Soon, Zhu Bajie reached the gate so he sped up and shouted, “Sun Wukong, help me!”



        In the blink of an eye, the chief, who was chasing after Zhu Bajie, was squashed into the ground by Sun Wukong with his Vajra Staff, which stunned all the pigs who rushed out following their leader.

        Just like that, the pig brigand incident came to an end.  However, this incident became Zhu Bajie’s nightmare that snuffed out his thought of returning to his true form again, haunting him ever since.</p>
