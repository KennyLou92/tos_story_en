        <h1>Oichi the Pining Teardrop</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 4
　　
        In the company of Azai, Oichi began her journey to find her older brother, Nobunaga. On their way, they bumped into some people from the Sanada family, who held an old feud with the Oda family, and thus started a fight. In the end, their opponents fled for their inability to contend against Azai. Azai wanted to go after them yet was stopped by a wildfire. 

        ‘It’s dangerous here. Let’s go.’ Azai ran in the opposite direction of the wildfire while screening Oichi from the flames. They only walked out of the forest and stopped to rest after running for a while.

        When Oichi finally got her breath back after the run, she heard a faint splashing noise, as if something was lapping against the shore.

        ‘...It’s the sea!’ Oichi clutched Azai’s sleeve and said in excitement, ‘I can hear the sound of waves. Maybe we can find a way out here.’

        “I don’t think that man would be so kind to leave such an easy escape route.” As Azai recalled that cloaked man who invited him to the island, he brought to mind that blatantly burning desire and inhuman presence. That man was definitely not a saint.

        However, his thought stopped at the tip of his tongue when he saw that elated look on Oichi’s face, so he held her hand instead and said gently, ‘Let’s go and see, but be careful.’

        And so, the two followed the sound of waves and finally arrived at a small coast after walking through an abandoned village and a lofty hanging bridge. There was a small houseboat docked at the narrow coast with no sign of life around, as though someone had accidentally left it.

        In order to ensure their safety, Azai deliberately waited for quite a long time before getting into the boat with Oichi when the night had closed down and nothing happened. There was no living creature on the boat but only complete silence, just like the secluded coast.

        Azai and Oichi looked around the cabins one by one. They felt a sense of relief when they found some food and water that were enough for ten people to eat for a whole week. However, they did not find other useful items other than that, which led them to a question.

        ‘Based on the necessities in the cabins, there should have been people living on this boat before, but it seemed that they all escaped from here for some unexpected reason...’ While Azai was analyzing, Oichi felt scared and unknowingly took a step closer to him. Her movement gave a small twitch in Azai’s heart, and thus he reassured her with a soft voice, ‘I’ll protect you. Don’t be afraid.’

        As Oichi looked at Azai’s face, which was bathed in the moonlight, some of her fear subsided so she nodded with a smile and said, ‘I’m not afraid as long as I have you with me.’

        ‘That should be the captain’s cabin. Let’s go and take a look.’

        Following Azai’s lead, Oichi went to the captain’s cabin. It was dark in there with the only light being the moonlight that filtered down to the steering wheel through the glass window. Before the wheel was an open sea map.

        Azai only took a glance at the map, then he went to tinker around with the control panel instead.

        ‘There isn’t much damage on this boat. It should still function.’ Azai succinctly summarized. Still, his face didn’t show much emotion.

        On the contrary, Oichi clapped her hands in excitement after hearing the news and said, ‘Great! Now we only have to find my brother, then we can leave this horrible place.’

        ‘Alright then, let’s go and find your brother.’ After taking a glance at the outside, Azai turned around and walked toward the door. However, he suddenly froze as he saw a puddle of green sticky liquid on the floor.

        “What is this——”

        ——Chomp, chomp, chomp…

        Unfortunately, there was no time for Azai to think—a weird noise sounded above his head. The dull sound that resembled a carnivore chewing its prey gave Azai a great shudder. It was a sign of the unprecedented crisis his body naturally showed.

        Since it was such a critical situation, Azai reached out to grab Oichi’s hands, then he tossed her out of the door with all his strength and in a rather rough way. Even though Oichi’s head was spinning after the fall, her eyes were yet locked on Azai who was still in the captain’s cabin.

        Azai, whose poker face unexpectedly changed to a nervous look, shouted at Oichi, who was still sitting in front of the cabin door, ‘Oichi! Run——Hmm!’

        Before he could even finish his words, his body was entangled by a tentacle thicker than a tree trunk and pulled into a dark corner of the room with a swish.

        Flabbergasted by the atrocious scene, Oichi was left with her mouth agape. She could not find her voice but only gasped in horror; tears uncontrollably ran down her face. As though she could not stand her impotence, she clutched her thighs so hard that the pain brought her senses back to her.

        ‘No… No… No… Azai!’ Coincidentally, the moon came out of a black cloud. When the soft moonlight fell on Oichi and crowned her with layers of light, her dark hair gradually turned white with crimson filling her eyes in a moment.

        As Oichi propped up her body and tilted her head back, the silver comb fell off her hair. Instead of falling to the ground, it turned into a flash of strong light and landed on Oichi’s hands as a pair of sharp silver claw gauntlets in an instant.

        ‘You bastard… I’m gonna kill you… I’ll tear you into pieces…’ Oichi completely flipped out under the curse and the double misfortune of losing Azai. Acting purely on instinct, she dashed back into the captain’s cabin.

        The huge tentacle that had taken Azai away immediately attacked Oichi, who swiftly swung her claws and cut it into pieces effortlessly like a tornado. Yet, she did not stop but sped up and ran to the dark corner where a lump of octopus-like creature that also showed a resemblance to a jellyfish stuck to the wall.

        Since the creature’s skin was translucent, Oichi could see Azai and a pile of human bones trapped in its abdomen. Her senses slightly came back as soon as she saw Azai. She held out her claws and grasped the creature tightly, then started pulling it apart hard. However, its skin was tougher than she thought and she could not tear it apart right away.

        Instead of giving up, Oichi summoned every ounce of her strength. She pulled so hard that she could even hear the screeching sound of her nearly cracking bones. Finally, a thin line appeared on the creature’s abdomen.
　　
        ‘Azai… Give him… Give him back to me!’ Oichi shouted while intensifying her pull with blue veins standing out on her hands.

        Slash—the creature’s abdomen was torn in half, releasing Azai and a large quantity of thick fluid to the floor. Oichi stumbled toward him and held him in her arms. Her tears kept falling on his face.

        Azai opened his eyes weakly—perhaps the heat of Oichi’s tears had awakened him—and smiled as soon as he met her crimson eyes. He then strenuously lifted his hand to gently wipe her tears and said with a hint of pampering, ‘Don’t cry. It breaks my heart whenever I see you cry.’

        ‘Mm… I’ll stop crying… I won’t cry as long as you’re okay…’ Holding Azai’s hands, Oichi gave him a faint smile.

        After cuddling with Oichi for a moment, Azai finally caught his breath so he sat upright and fed Oichi with his blood to calm her down. Only until then did they have the time to look at the corpse of that monster lying on the floor not far away. Still fluttering with fear, Oichi asked, ‘What is that?’

        ‘It should be a creature in the sea that had metamorphosed after swallowing  the mad men. The people on this boat should have been eaten by this thing.’

        ‘That’s… so horrible.’

        ‘There, there. Everything is alright now.’ Azai gently drew Oichi to his arms and said, ‘You saved me. Thank you.’

        ‘It was nothing. You’ve saved me so many times before…’ Blushing with shyness, Oichi lowered her head and whispered, ‘Besides, you never have to say thank you to me.’ 

        ‘...Right.’ Azai, as always, replied laconically but there was a hint of liveliness in his tone this time. ‘Let’s go find your brother. I’m afraid something may happen if we keep him waiting for too long.’

        ‘Sure.’ Oichi answered merrily. Then she held Azai’s hand and stood up. It warmed her heart when she looked at his back.

        “I finally protected you once this time.”</p>
