        <h1>Valiant Protector - Basti</h1>
        <p>        After Basti had successfully returned the Ancestral Elements to Tefnut, Mufasa was restored to power as the tribal chief. Together, the Spiritual Beasts brought prosperity back to their tribe.

        One day, the sky was covered by thick clouds. Rain poured like beads falling from a broken necklace. The water level was rising and the river was flowing fast. They were all signs of an impending flood. Since the tribe was near the river, the chief and the priest, Mufasa and Basti, promptly decided to evacuate the village while Odous, Iquitos and other strong Spiritual Beasts went to the border to build a dam with stones and sand to minimize the damage of the flood.

        Amid the lashing rain, Basti stayed at the back of the line lest any Spiritual Beasts would fall behind or walk out of the evacuation route accidentally.

        Basti’s anxiety grew as she saw the river running faster.

        ‘The water flow is getting faster! We need to speed up the evacuation.’

        “Everyone, hurry up! The flood is coming!”

        Just then, Basti heard a cry for help from a distance.

        “Help! Help…”

        “Someone is in danger!” Basti immediately ran toward the sound only to find a young Spiritual Beast drowning in the river that was pushing him into the distance.

        “Don’t worry! I’m coming!”

        Basti raised her staff to conjure dark elements. As she swung her staff in the direction of the child, the dark elements turned into a net and scooped the child out of the water.

        When Basti was going to check on the child as soon as he was back on the ground, the child pointed at her back and said with fright.

        “Oh no… The flood is here!”

        Basti turned around and saw that the river had burst its narrow banks with a great wave that was several meters tall coming at them. In a state of panic, Basti waved her staff again to send the child to the top of a big tree.

        The second after the child was sent to the tree, the wave smashed against the land and devoured everything ruthlessly. Seeing Basti being washed away by the wave, the child on the tree screamed, “Basti!”

        The river flooded the land in an imposing manner. When Basti finally managed to stick her head out of the muddy water, she found that the water had pushed her away from the shore in the distance.

        The velocity of the fast-flowing river kept increasing. Basti was plunged into a state of panic when she saw the end of the river where the water began to drop.

        ‘Oh no! It’s a waterfall!’

        Basti immediately conjured dark elements in an attempt to get herself out of the water. However, a sudden sharp pain in her back stopped her from doing so. It turned out that a broken tree in the flooding river hit and gashed her back, causing her to bleed.

        It was too late by the time Basti tried to conjure the elements again—she had been washed away by the water. Water splashed as she fell into the pond below the waterfall which was about ten meters tall. With the impact of the fall sapping Basti’s strength, she couldn’t swim up but only sank into the pond slowly.

        ‘Am I… going to die…’ The feeling of suffocation blurred Basti’s vision. She saw a vague figure swimming toward her but she passed out before she could have a clearer look at the swimmer’s face.

        When Basti regained consciousness, she found herself lying on the shore with a human man sitting next to her. Seeing her awake, the man said with a long face, ‘Finally, you’re awake.’

        ‘He must have saved me from the water,’ Basti thought, and so she thanked him, “Thank you for saving my life!”

        Unexpectedly, not only the man did not accept her words of gratitude but he scolded her, “Are you an idiot? You should be avoiding the water, not falling into it when there is a flood! If I didn’t save you, you could have——”

        The man turned his face away and stopped talking in the middle of his words. He did not dare to say the possible result that could have happened.

        “I’m not an idiot! I was saving that kid…” As Basti spoke, she found that the tone of the man in front of her sounded familiar, just like Felix.

        Felix was the captain of an army of mercenaries who had taken a job from the Nightfall Savant to steal the Ancestral Elements in the Spiritual Beast tribe. To help him sneak into the tribe, the Nightfall Savant turned him into a cat. However, Felix changed his mind about stealing the Ancestral Elements after spending a while with the Spiritual Beasts. In the end, he returned the Ancestral Elements to Basti instead of handing them over to the Nightfall Savant.

        However, Felix left without leaving Basti a note after returning the Ancestral Elements to the tribe.

        “You’re Felix…”

        Giving Basti a gentle smile, the man said, ‘Too slow, dummy.’

        “I’m not dumb! But how did you turn back into a human?!”

        “I found the potion. I’ve defeated the darkness and finished my job. That’s why I’m back.”

        “Then… Are you going to leave again?” Still, Basti was afraid that Felix would leave without saying a word like the last time he did.

        “No, I’m not leaving. But will you still let me stay after everything I did?”

        “Of course… Welcome back!”

        Basti opened her arms and held Felix tightly.

        A moment later, the rain stopped along with the rising river. Basti took Felix’s hand and started running, leading him into the tribe the way she did when they first met.</p>
