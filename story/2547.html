        <h1>Rising From Ashes - Achilles</h1>
        <p>        Ever since Thetis was tethered to Achilles’s body, her mind had been gradually contaminated by Achilles’s resentment and became the warlord on the battlefield. Whenever there was a battlefield, that crimson figure would be there, wiping out everything in his sight. Until one day, Thetis’s memory slowly slid into his heart.

        He then recalled that he was just a tool created by Gods.

        The clash of divine power and demonic power inside Achilles’s body made his mind drift between sanity and madness. However, there was not a moment when Achilles had ever forgotten his hatred for Gods.

        He was born of divine power;
He died in compliance with the plan of Gods;
He was then resurrected under the will of Gods.
Yet, his mother, who gave birth to him, told him he was wrong and wanted to take back his life.

        Like a plotted show, Achilles’s fate—from his birth to his death—was never held on his own hands, not even a second. Slaughter was the only moment when he felt like himself instead of a pawn of Gods. He loathed all Gods; yet the one to whom he held the deepest hatred was the creator of his flesh—his mother, Thetis.

        ‘Die!’ Following a swing of Achilles’s weapon, a soldier's head flew through the air.

        At this moment, he was leading an army of Demons to invade a town that worshiped the God of the Sun, Apollo, who saw all humans as his servants; who killed Achilles and let him watch as his companions die.

        Achilles broke through the town gate easily. As he swung his sword and slain everyone before him, he could feel the commotion of the demonic blood inside his heart. Seeing the human disciples who were still shouting Apollo’s name until their last breath, he let out a scornful laugh loudly.

        “Gods save the people? No, they only see us as livestock and their tools!”

        What lay behind Achilles was an ocean of blood and carcasses. With a riotous laugh, he slashed and beheaded the bronze statue of Apollo.

        Buildings were on fire; Demons were looting everywhere while screams of humans were echoing through the town. All of these gave Achilles pleasure. Just then, a hail of light arrows descended from the sky and shot all the Demons in the town accurately.

        Achilles raised the shield of Thetis to block the attack, only to find a God with white hair was looking down on him in the air. Then, troops of God soldiers came in all directions and beleaguered him.

        ‘Demon, I won’t let you take another innocent life!’ said Bael, firmly and righteously.

        Yet, the siege of the soldiers was nothing to Achilles. The only thing he saw was that God looking down on everything from high above. At that very moment, monstrous hatred flared up inside him.

        With all his strength, Achilles threw the shield of Theis into the air and leaped at the same time, disregarding the light arrows hitting him. Still, he failed to reach that God high above even with his best jump.

        In mid-air, Achilles stepped on the shield that he had tossed, kicked hard, and made another leap—his hands grasped Bael’s wings tightly…

‘I’VE GOT YOU!’

        With a swirl of sand, the God and Demon spun in the air and eventually fell to the ground hard, leaving a big hole.
　　
        Soon, the sand scattered, revealing the scene behind where Achilles held down Bael. Just the moment when Achilles was about to finish Bael off, a blast of blinding blue light hit him. That blow was so powerful that knocked him unconscious. 

        Then, a blue-haired goddess in eastern clothing slowly descended into the battlefield.

        As the Goddess of Order, Giemsa felt a strange and distorted divine power so she sent her avatar to the realm of humans for inspection and happened to see the scene when Achilles was going to kill Bael.

        ‘Goddess Giemsa…’

        ‘I can feel the presence of god in this demon. This is unusual. Let me take him back to the realm of gods and take a look.’ Leaving these words, Giemsa then manipulated her avatar to bring Achilles back to the realm of gods…</p>
