        <h1>Idun the Timeless Oracle</h1>
        <p>        Idun was gradually lost in the eternity of life. Her hourglass had long been full of overflowing memories. Time no longer meant anything to Idun. She was frazzled in the course of subduing the Dragon of Poison in the Tower over and over again. To soothe her, the elements showed her an astonishingly realistic illusion…

        In the past, Idun and Angrboda traveled in search of the golden apple, hoping to protect their fellow folks in times of war with its power. Later, however, Angrboda was put under a curse, so Idun had no choice but to continue the journey alone. And now she was finally back in the North with the power of the golden apple.

        In a snowstorm, Idun knocked on the door of Angrboda’s house, only to see the careworn Loki…

        Loki told her that Angrboda had already died a long time ago because of the curse. Yet, that was not the end of their misfortune—Angrboda’s curse had spread to their daughter, Hel. The girl was skinny and weak; her legs looked like dried branches. It was palpably the consequence of the curse. Looking at Hel, Idun was deeply shocked with tears brimming in her eyes.

        ‘Hel will probably die of the curse like Angrboda in a few days… The only way to save her is to infuse the power of the golden apple into Hel’s body. Did you find the golden apple?’ said Loki in a serious tone, with the last flicker of hope in his eyes.

        At that moment, Idun hesitated. She had always seen Angrboda as her only family and Hel was the only offspring of Angrboda, but the power of the golden apple was still a mystery that she had not fully comprehended.

        Idun dared not risk Hel’s life, nor did she want to. She deeply feared that Hel might die because of the choice she made. Eventually, she succumbed to her fear of uncertainty and chose to lie to Loki.

        ‘...No, I did not. I’m sorry.’

        The light in Loki’s eyes completely faded as he heard Idun.

        Idun walked out of—more precisely, ran away from—Loki’s house. That night, Hel’s condition dramatically worsened. Suffering from the torment of the curse, the girl finally died on her bed, while Loki, the wise man of the North hanged himself under a beam in his house.

        Looking at the two bodies, Idun was stunned and racked by choking sobs, with her heart drowned in remorse and fear.

        From that day on, Idun embarked on a journey to the further depths of the North alone, hoping to live her life incognito in a place where she could run away from everything and the past…

        Without Loki’s wisdom, the North Alliance kept losing ground to the demons. Their leader, Odin, was also seriously wounded in a battle which almost took his life. In order to save the North, Tyr the war deity asked around for the golden apple. After he finally learned the whereabouts of Idun, he took Odin to her place, hoping that she could heal him.

        Looking at Odin, the terribly scarred leader of the North, Idun could not help but feel the bitterness of life. If Odin, who had the Armor of Runes, was even covered in bruises, the ordinary soldiers without godly power could only be worse.

        “Running away does not make my mistakes disappear. The shackles of guilt are still tightly fixed on my limbs, forcing me to confront the malice of fate.”

        Idun finally gave up escaping and took up that heavy wheel of fate.

        “Still, I could not stop myself from falling victim to fate. Just like Odin, we are all nothing but sacrificial lambs.”

        And so, Idun extracted the power of the golden apple and infused it into Odin’s body. The hero of the North was saved, but Idun slowly shrank—her fully grown body turned back into a child’s one in a short moment.

        “Everyone has that moment when fear takes over them, but fate never spares its prey. We are all sacrificial lambs to the world.”</p>
