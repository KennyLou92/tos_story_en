        <h1>May Chang</h1>
        <p>A girl from a foreign country, with her giant panda Shao May in tow.

Her true identity is the 17th imperial princess of Xing, born between the emperor and a woman from the Chang clan. In order to have the emperor raise the stature of the Chang clan, which is currently at the lowest rank in Xing, May Chang has come to Amestris in search of the formula for eternal youth, just like Ling.

She is cheerful, openhearted, and courteous. She seems to be of adolescent age, as her romantic fantasies are stronger than most others. She is versed in “Alkahestry,” Xing’s version of alchemy, and she is also able to read the “chi” that resides in all things.

She uses hyo darts along with her proficiency in martial arts to attack her opponents.
