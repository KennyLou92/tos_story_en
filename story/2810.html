        <h1>Immolation of Alienation - Draco</h1>
        <p>        In a simple village surrounded by beautiful nature, a man was standing under a tree while a spring breeze rustled his hair. As the man lifted his head, his handsome yet languorous face came to light. However, his eyes were filled with sorrow and pity the moment he saw Draco.

        “No… Don’t look at me like that!” With a groan, Draco woke up from the dream only to find herself trapped in the rubble.

        ‘Where am I…’ Draco looked around in the darkness and recalled her memories. ‘Oh right, Belial that bastard sent me here for investigation, saying the secret of gods lies here.’

        Draco, who was once an astralist candidate, defected to the demons after being told that she was unqualified to be an astralist. She had been working for Belial since then. This time, she was sent to a ruin to carry out an investigation.

        Draco thought it was just a false intel but she accidentally discovered the secret entrance where she fought against Dolu, the mechanical guardian. The fight ended with Draco crushing the floor, causing both of them to fall into the underground.

        Due to the fall, Draco lost consciousness for a while. Now that she woke up, she climbed out of the pile of gravel and started exploring the basement. The deeper she went, the more surprised she got.

        ‘I can’t believe there is such a huge space underground. What are they going to do with this?’ Draco pondered. Her question was soon answered when she pushed open the door. Behind the door was a boundless space in which she saw an array of mechanical soldiers standing quietly. It seemed that they had not been activated.

        “These are… Tut! Those damn gods hide an army here!” Draco bit her nails nervously and thought, “I have to tell Belial as soon as possible and make some countermeasures.”

        Draco decisively made up her mind, but a chill ran up her spine when she was about to turn around and leave. She immediately spread her dragon wings and flew into the air.

        Boom! A murderous ball of light hit the spot where Draco had stood and charred the ground. Draco would have ended up like the charred floor if she moved a second later just now.

        “It seems we have an agile thief here today.” A female voice sounded from above so Draco looked over only to see a woman with a scepter of stars in her hand, exuding a tremendous amount of godly power.

        “You must be Lady Aether whom that weird mechanical soldier mentioned earlier.” Draco soon figured out who the woman was.

        “Oh, so not only you’re an agile thief, but you’re also a quick thinker,” said Aether in a confident manner. “It’s such a shame you’re not smart enough to know the right place for you from the wrong one. Since you’ve discovered this place, I can’t let you leave now. My suggestion to you is to try not to struggle. At least, you won’t suffer much pain in that way.”

         “Let’s see who’s the one that will struggle.” Draco argued against Aether proudly. Yet, her words sounded nothing but a dog’s bark to the latter.

        Aether shook her head in pity, then she raised her scepter and conjured countless sharp blades with her immense power to attack Draco.

        Draco flapped her wings to dodge the blades. When she was dodging the last one, she deliberately swooped down and let the blade make a cut on Aether’s face. Only after then did she destroy all the blades that followed her.

        “Ha, it seems you’re wrong.” Draco gave Aether a triumphant smirk.

        To Draco’s disappointment, Aether did not show any sign of rage or embarrassment. Instead, she calmly wiped the blood from her face and said with easy confidence, “No, I’m never wrong.”

        “What—— Ahhhhh!” Before Draco could finish her words, an excruciating pain shot up her body and forced a scream out of her. Numerous spears made of godly power suddenly protruded from Draco’s body, puncturing her wings. Blood splashed, creating several wisps of white smoke in the air.

        “You have inherited such great talents but you don’t know how to use them. What a waste. Since you can’t make the best use of your talents, why don’t you give them to me.” Finally, a hint of excitement broke through the composed façade of Aether. She slowly approached Draco, who was hung up in mid-air.

        Before the looming crisis, however, Draco could barely react due to the excessive loss of blood. In a state of turmoil, she saw that phantom in her dream again—the man under the tree looked at her, his eyes filled with sorrow and pity, as though he was looking at an unwise and impenitent child.

        ‘Don’t look at me like that! I did nothing wrong! I never regret my choices! I want power! Endless power! And I will get it even if I have to lose all my emotions!’

        The man disappeared—perhaps he feared Draco’s strong will. Replacing him was a small ball of dark green light that kept growing and pulsating. Draco could not help reaching her hand to it at its vibrant energy.

        ‘Yeah, this is all I want, endless power.’ As soon as Draco touched the ball of the light, it shone and enveloped her whole body.

        Draco felt that every part of her body was being torn apart and reshaped. The bone-crushing pain made her scream, but all she heard was a hoarse and low-pitched roar.

        ‘This is my voice?’ Draco lowered her head in bewilderment, only to find that her hands had completely turned into the arms of a dragon and those spears that pierced through her wings had all been broken. She was free again.

        “Oh my… She wakes up.” Aether’s face sank when she saw the dark green dragon. Feeling entertained, Draco gave Aether a grin while summoning her power to deliver a series of heavy blows.

        ‘This is not what I expected… I should better run first.’ As soon as Aether drew an conclusion from her analysis, she decisively fled from the basement after launching an attack. Draco did not go after her, more precisely, she could not.

        Even though Draco awakened her power, she still had not get used to it. On top of that, the injuries she received had made it impossible. In fact, she was basically a spent arrow since she had used up most of her power. Even the spate of desperate attacks she launched just now was a bluff.

        After Draco landed on the ground, she returned to her human form and sat on the ground to take a rest. Then she propped herself up again and walked toward the exit step by step.

        ‘Anyways, I have to go back to the base and tell Belial the secret here.’</p>
