        <h1>Dawn-breaking Grace - Gawain</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.3

        To overthrow Mordred, save Guinevere and find the last Star Stone, Gawain and his friends sneaked into the palace and split into three teams.

        Following Tristan's lead, they went smoothly with only a few guards patrolling along the way and came to a wide unmanned corridor. Suddenly, Gawain felt a chill down his spine so he immediately defended with his sword!

        That brute strength with a presence of black magic-it was Lancelot.

        'Tristan! Go!' Gawain flung Lancelot off forcefully.

        'But… You take care of yourself!' Said Tristan, who ran right away and disappeared at the end of the spiral staircase.

        'Kill… Kill the intruders.' said Lancelot with a hoarse and deep voice. He raised his sword and fiercely slashed with murderous eyes and the looming purple airstream of black magic.

        Gawain blocked the attack, wielding his sword with a reverse grip. Lancelot drew his sword and attacked again. For a while, the clink of metal knocking together continued to ring. Compared to Lancelot who had no scruples, Gawain was rather unaggressive with his attack which placed him at a disadvantage. Flesh wounds on his body gradually increased.

        Boom! A resonant sound came from underground.

        'It is an explosion caused by a magic collision… Was it Merlin?' While Gawain was pondering,  Lancelot knelt on the ground as if he was racked with pain as the purple airstream on him somehow became thinner.

        'Um… Gawain…' Lancelot let out a faint murmur.

        'Lancelot! You’re awake!' Surprised, Gawain stepped forward and was about to help Lancelot up. Yet, a strong gust of purple airstream came in his way. Not only did it enfold Lancelot, it even got into his body arbitrarily.

        'Argh! Stop… Stop controlling… Arrgh——!' Lancelot uttered an anguished cry. Yet, soon he stopped and got up, standing like a lifeless doll.

        'Lancelot!' shouted Gawain. Meanwhile, part of the purple airstream turned into an exquisite figure——a beautiful woman, who seemed to be badly injured as her gorgeous face was pale with blood stains that had not yet been wiped off the corner of her mouth.

        'Morgan le Fay! What did you do to Lancelot?!' Recognizing her immediately, Gawain asked her with mounting anger.

        'I came to take my pawn back so that I can kill that detestable sorcerer!' Losing her usual poise, Morgan le Fay champed with rage and said, 'How dare she disguised as my son to sap me! Unforgivable!'

        'The sorcerer that disguised as her son… is properly Merlin… Morgan le Fay must have been seriously damaged by Merlin and her power weakened, which gave Lancelot a chance to break free… I must seize this opportunity!'

        'Lancelot! Wake up!'

        'It’s useless. Even though my power is weakened, it’s still enough for me to control him. Go, go kill that cumbersome guy!' Morgan le Fay flashed a bewitching smile.

        'Ki-... Kill…' With his eyes brimmed with menace, Lancelot drew his sword and lashed madly against Gawain. Blocking the attack, Gawain yelled hysterically, 'You just let her control you that easily? Why did you seek power in the first place?! Don’t you remember what King Uther had taught us?!' 

        '...King Uther… No… Hmm...' Lancelot paused for a second, but he soon returned to his wooden expression and said, 'Kill the cumbersome guy.'

        'Ha, he can’t get rid of my restraint. Give up. He belongs to the dark, just like me.' Morgan le Fay gave a scornful laughter softly, 'Enough for playing. Finish him.'

        Following Morgan le Fay’s words, Lancelot let out a low growl with a ferocious hint of menace and launched attacks that were even more fierce than before, which became hard to ward off for the wounded Gawain.

        Gawain kept stepping back until he hit the stone pillar behind him. Just as Lancelot raised his sword and was about to thrust it into Gawain’s left chest, a reflection of light fell into his eyes——it was the battle steed badge of Juvenile Knights, a token given by King Uther.

        The sunlight reflecting off the badge stung Lancelot and recalled the memory buried deep inside him—— That person whom he saw as his second parent and the blonde girl who inherited these clear blue eyes. Together they shone a light that could dispel all darkness.，

        'King Uther, Arthur…' As Lancelot’s pupils contracted, his hand drew back——

        Slash! Blood dribbled down from the blade to the hilt and stained Lancelot’s hand with crimson. Looking at Lancelot in shock, Gawain slowly slid down and fell to the ground, motionless.

        'You’re certainly a former Juvenile Knight. Now I can teach that sorcerer...a lesson——argh…' Morgan le Fay looked at the blade that pierced through her abdomen unbelievably. She tilted her face and looked at Lancelot, who was holding the sword behind her, and asked, 'How did… you break my control...'

        'Because I have something more powerful in my heart.' Lancelot retracted his sword. Losing her support, Morgan le Fay fell with blood spreading on the ground.

        'Finally you’re back.' Gawain stood up and looked at Lancelot’s bleeding right hand. 'Are you alright?'

        'Humph. A little pain couldn’t have awoken me.' said Lancelot, tearing the cloth on the hem to wrap the wound on his right palm. A moment ago, Lancelot pretended to attack Gawain and stabbed himself to gain back sanity instead.

        'What’s the deal now?' asked Lancelot.  As Gawain told him their plan, Lancelot thought for a while and said, 'now we only need the Excalibur back.'

        'Yeah, I’m afraid it is already in Mordred’s hand.'

        'Then let’s go and take it back.'

        'No. You go take it back.' Gawain’s words drew Lancelot’s gaze. But soon he knew what the former meant——a swamp of dark-metal-armored soldiers appeared on the other end of the corridor.

        'You alone——'

        'Who do you think I am?' Raising a confident smile, Gawain held his sword upright. Sunlight reflecting on the blade cast a brilliant halo. 'I’m the Knight Commander chosen by King Uther himself.'

        Lancelot looked at Gawain with his eyes full of joy. As he gave Gawain a few slaps of trust on his shoulder, he left...</p>
