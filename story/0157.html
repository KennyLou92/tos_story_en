        <h1>Sacred Cougar</h1>
        <p>        Enochian Tower was built by the concerted efforts of several countries as a link to the realm of gods.  To protect it, people in the ancient times created the golems to serve as its foundation.  However, every party desired to seize the power of Gods exclusively for themselves, so the golems they created were only loyal to their own faction.  They drove all the others away from the Tower.  With the golems each serving their own master, no one was able to reach the realm of gods through the Tower, not until the arrival of the Demons...

        Sacred golems were saintly and mighty.  They were ordered to guard the fourth gate of the tower base.  When the Demons arrived, they emitted bright Holylight to attack the Demon intruders.

        Back then, Sacred Cougar still had the appearance of a statue.  It struck the Demons with its Holylight.  But when the light hit the Demon troops, strangely, the energy was totally absorbed by a Demon.  When the Demon stretched his hands, the light elements around him wildly gathered into a ball in his hand, large and bright as the sun.

        He waved his hand gently and shot the ball of light to Sacred Cougar, enveloping it.  The power was so strong that it seemed as if it was tearing the golem apart.  Sacred Cougar tried hard to resist using its own elemental power.  As it roared, the ball of light suddenly shrank and streamed towards its core.  Under the powerful impact of light elements, Sacred Cougar fell in the Demon’s mocking gaze...

        When Sacred Cougar awoke, it found itself in a grand stone chamber.  It realized that it had returned to its “place of birth”.  Looking at its lengthened claws, it sensed that its appearance had become different as well...</p>
