        <h1>Uncertain Heartbeat - Hel</h1>
        <p>        Hel was the daughter of Loki and his deceased wife. Loki loved her very much. However, her body was weak, and more fragile than normal people’s due to the curse that she inherited from her mother. Whenever the curse attacked, her legs would be racked with excruciating pain that could incapacitate her. That was why Loki was always worried about her.


        It was a sunny day—clear sky and gentle breezes—perfect for a hike. On a hill not far from the military camp, a tall, tanned woman was pushing Hel, who was in a wheelchair, to the top to admire the view. The woman was named Amy. She was a nanny hired by Loki to take care of Hel in his absence for military reasons.

        Looking at the picturesque scenery before her, Hel was wreathed in smiles of amusement, and she said, ‘It is beautiful here. Amy, thank you for taking me out for a walk here and letting me have a moment away from the camp.’

        “No, it’s nothing. I can take you here again at any time if you want!”

        Suddenly, they heard a rustling sound from the bushes nearby. Two beasts came out from the dark corner. Baring their teeth, they closed in on Hel and Amy step by step.

        “Amy! Run!” Hel tried to push Amy away but the latter who was standing at her back shook her head. With a confident and bright smile, she reassured Hel, “Hel, don’t worry. Leave it to me!”

        Soon after Amy left her words, she charged at one of the beasts and carried its body over her shoulders with one hand clamping its snout and the other around its body. Then she vigorously threw it at the other beast. Knowing that they were no match for Amy, the two beasts immediately got up and ran away with their tails between their legs.


        “Phew… They’re gone. Everything alright? Hel?” asked Amy worriedly, kneeling in front of Hel.

        It took a while for Hel’s senses to come back to her. The moment they did, she looked at Amy reverently with sparkles in her eyes and said excitedly, “Amy, you’re amazing! I can’t believe you just lifted a beast with your bare hands!”

        “Hehe!” Amy scratched her cheek. Hel’s words made her flush. Still, she could not help but say triumphantly, “I grew up on a farm so I often had to carry bundles of grass and buckets of milk around. Sometimes, I even had to carry calves. That’s how I built up my strength.”

        “Really? Tell me more!” Hel asked curiously. Amy then began to tell her the funny stories she had back on the farm all the way back home.

        When they got home, they saw Loki standing at the door, looking worried. Loki hurriedly walked to Hel and squatted down to check on her the moment he saw her. Confused by her father’s action, Hel asked, ‘Daddy, what’s wrong?’

        ‘I heard that there were beasts attacking people on the hill and I was worried sick that you would be in danger, so I rushed all the way back here. Thank goodness you’re okay.’

        Seeing Loki’s tightly knitted brows, Hel knew that she had caused her father worry again, so she immediately comforted him and said, “It’s all thanks to Amy. She chased all those beasts away.”

        Loki finally turned his gaze away from Hel and laid his eyes on Amy for the first time. He said in a gentle tone, “Thank you for saving Hel.”

        Amy returned him a sunny smile and said, “I was just doing my job.”


        Loki spotted a small wound on Amy’s arms. “Your arm is hurt.”

        Hel took Amy’s arm to take a look and said, “Amy, the beasts must have scratched you when you fought them just now.”


        “It’s just a scratch. It’s fine. I’m okay!”

        “Still, you need to bandage it properly.”

        Without saying another word, Loki began to take care of Amy’s wound after he took out a handkerchief and bandages. Holding Amy’s hand, he gently cleaned the wound with the wet handkerchief. His warmth spread through the thin cloth to Amy’s skin and tickled her heart.

        Then Hel saw Amy’s face flushing with vivid red spreading from her cheeks to her neck and ears. Covering her face, Amy said shyly, “Thank you.”

        Hel was surprised. She never saw this side of Amy, who had always been tough and outspoken.

        Amy never paid attention to her appearance. She did not care if her clothes were wrinkled or if they looked good or not. Loki happened to find her collar upturned so he gave a gentle reminder.


        After Amy touched her collar and found it just like what Loki had said, she gave him a silly smile and said, “Oh, you’re right.”

        Perhaps Amy’s innocent smile was infectious—Loki’s lips curled up unknowingly and that made Hel’s pupils slightly widen. Hel had not seen Loki smile for a long time. He always had a frown on his face either because of wars or her body


        Although Hel was not hurt by the beasts, the nerve-racking experience still brought her down with a fever that night.

        Loki promptly called a doctor for her. After taking the medicine, Hel’s body temperature began to drop and she was getting better. Still, Loki was worried that the fever might recur in the middle of the night so he decided to stay by her bed all night long.

        It upset Amy to see the careworn Loki so she walked to him and said, “Let me take care of Hel.”

        “No, let me. You take some rest.”

        “...I will be right outside. Just call my name whenever you need me.”

        In the middle of the night, Hel finally woke up. When she opened her eyes, she saw that Loki had fallen asleep on the table beside her bed. There were clear dark circles under her eyes that further underlined his raddled face. Hel could not help but feel a sense of guilt, thinking that it must be terrible for her father to run around between wars and her every day.

        Suddenly, a night breeze came through the window gaps, sending a shudder through the sleeping Loki’s body. As much as Hel wanted to put a coat on her father, his coat was hung on the coat rack by the door, somewhere out of her reach.

        Out of nowhere, a melancholic feeling welled up in Hel’s heart. Born with a curse, her body was weaker than normal people’s. She could barely move her legs, let alone take care of Loki. All she did was cause him trouble. Importantly, who knows how long she can live? Eventually, she would die from the curse and leave Loki one day. 

        While Hel let grief swallow her, Amy, who had been standing by outside, walked in and quietly draped the coat over Loki’s shoulders. It was then Hel saw the deep affection on Amy’s face and realized that Amy loved Loki, romantically, like a wife to her husband.

        ‘Yeah, if Daddy has someone by his side, he won’t be lonely even when I die. She can take care of him and share his burden. Most importantly, she can make him happy,’ Hel thought. Then she made up her mind.

        A few days later, Hel asked both Loki and Amy to have a walk in the bazaar near the village. However, Hel never showed up, leaving Loki and Amy alone in the bazaar.

        Seeing through Hel’s plan, of course, Loki turned down Amy and went back to the military camp alone. The next day, Hel knew that Amy was fired.

        During dinner that night, Hel looked at Loki dismally and asked, “Daddy, why did you fire Amy? Didn’t she make you happy?”
　　　　
        “I don’t need those fleeting moments of pleasure.” Holding out a hand, Loki touched Hel’s face which was haggard due to the curse and the fever, and said, “Hel, only your happiness is the eternal salvation to my soul.”

        Hel said in dejection, “But I’ll be gone eventually ——”

        “No! I won’t let that happen!” Loki abruptly stopped Hel. Leaning forward, he put his forehead against Hel’s and whispered, “Hel, you’re my heart, my life, my everything. I will cease to exist if you leave me. Do you understand?”

        “...Yes, Daddy. I will try my best to live, for you.” Only then did it dawn on Hel to realize what Loki truly desired. Even though living was nothing but suffering to her, she would strive for Loki and live as a drop of sweet nectar in his life of misfortunes.</p>
