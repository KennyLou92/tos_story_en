        <h1>Antithesis, Contrarian</h1>
        <p>
        The incarnation of both righteousness and wickedness. As it regularly vanquished all kinds of evil, it became arrogant, beginning to worship itself for being a hero among heroes.
After destroying its enemies in a fierce battle, Antithesis would absorb their energy. From this, it discovered why its enemies fought. But upon realizing that its actions wrought the same consequences as those of the beings it condemned as evil, it began to doubt itself and its purpose, allowing the evil energy accumulated in its lower body to go out of control. With its ego collapsed, Antithesis transformed into evil incarnate, bringing destruction to its world, transmuting cities into iron sand, then attracting and absorbing them using magnetism to feed its power.</p>
