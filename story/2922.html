        <h1>Defiled Cravings - Varuni</h1>
        <p>Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.3

        In a magnificent villa in Sinha, a woman of exquisite beauty rested on a luxurious armchair with two muscular and handsome servants waiting on her. She savored the fruits and fine wines offered by the servants while flirting with them, relishing every moment of the opulent experience that appealed to her vanity. However, none of it seemed to fill the void within her heart.

        “I wonder… How is Brahma doing now? It’s been a while since I heard from him…” Varuni sighed wistfully, thinking of a man who could never be hers.

        However, Varuni’s reverie was soon interrupted by the sound of hurried footsteps. A robust figure stormed into the room, seething with anger as he sat on the wooden chair beside her. He grabbed a cup from the coffee table and gulped it down.

        “Agni, what’s with the long face?” Varuni gestured for the two servants to leave, leaving her and Agni alone.

        Varuni had been determined to dismantle the Chakra Theory ever since Brahma rejected her due to his devotion to the theory. By a strange coincidence, she met Agni, who served in the Sinha Army when she performed a dance in the palace. After finding Agni’s disdain for the Chakra Theory, she deliberately approached him and managed to persuade him to join forces with her.

        Afterward, with Varuni’s help, Agni achieved remarkable feats with the power of henna tattoos and eventually won Varuna’s trust, becoming the king’s right-hand man.

        “His Majesty is displeased. He just took away my army and handed it over to that despicable eunuch,” Agni grunted.

        “Why? I thought you found a toy for a king that could alleviate his pain. She was quite a pitiable girl as I recall,” Varuni commented while reminiscing about the girl, Lakshmi’s appearance.

        Some days ago, Varuna was struck by a man named Shiva during his conquest of a blue-skinned tribe in a coastal region. Unexpectedly, the man’s strike cured his congenital insensitivity to pain and struck fear into his heart, rendering the invincible king no longer fearless.

        “That did help alleviate the King’s suffering. Still, it was not the perfect cure and the King remained dissatisfied. Somehow, that eunuch managed to find a physician who actually stopped the pain!”

        “I see, no wonder the eunuch has won His Majesty’s trust,” Varuni said with a soft chuckle which only further irritated Agni. He grumbled, “How could you be so calm about this? If we don’t get rid of that physician, the eunuch will someday replace me, and we won’t be able to dismantle the Chakra Theory!”

        “Don’t worry. As long as that physician isn’t a desireless man, I can handle him,” Varuni said confidently as she licked her lips.

        However, her confidence shattered the moment when she actually met the physician. It turned out that he was none other than the man of her dream, Brahma.

        “It’s been a while, Varuni,” Brahma greeted her with his usual gentle smile, his voice resonating with a warm smile that shook Varuni’s composure.

        “Brahma… What are you doing in Sinha? Where’s Shata?” Varuni asked urgently, only to witness a shadow of sadness crossing Brahma’s face. 

        “Shata’s left me and embarked on her ascetic practice.”

        Brahma’s answer brought Varuni an overwhelming sense of joy. She eagerly stepped closer to him and put her hands on his arm, her fingertips lightly tracing flirtatious hints on his skin as she whispered, “Then why don’t you be with me? I would never leave you alone if I were her.”

        Unfortunately, Brahma turned down her invitation again.

        Brahma shook his head and gently pulled Varuni’s hands away from his arm. His smile remained gentle but distant as if there was an invisible waterfall between them that kept Varuni away and drenched her mounting passion.

        “Thank you, Varuni, but what I need is enlightenment, not the solace of another lover,” Brahma said unwaveringly, “The awakening of oneself is the sole lifelong pursuit I seek.”

        “...Is that so? Then I wish you never seek enlightenment,” Varuni raised her head haughtily and left those bitter words before decisively walking away. Only she knew that beneath her strong facade lay a heart deeply wounded by love and rejections.

        Varuni thought that she would finally get over Brahma after yet another rejection. However, her heart tickled once again when she witnessed Brahma’s unquestionable brilliance as he gradually earned more of the King’s trust and attention, reigniting her desire for that exceptionally intelligent man.

        ‘I have to at least get a taste of his body, even if I can’t have his heart!” One night, Varuni, who could no longer suppress her restless longing for Brahma, quietly went to his dwellings in the middle of the night, only to see him leaving the house, dressed in unusually dark clothes that were convenient for nocturnal activities.

        ‘Why is he going out so late and dressed in such discreet clothes? He must be hiding something, perhaps something illicit,’ Varuni thought as a mischievous smile flickered across her face, ‘If I can find his secret, he’ll have no choice but to do as I say.’

        With such a sinister intent, Varuni stealthily followed Brahma until they arrived at a secluded forest where she watched his figure disappear into a cave.

        To avoid being noticed, Varuni waited outside the cave for a while before cautiously entering. However, she soon found herself faced with three different paths within the cavern and hesitated.

        ‘Which way did Brahma go… Oh well, I guess I’ll just choose one and see where it leads.’ Varuni headed toward the rightmost path. Strangely, the temperature dropped significantly as she ventured deeper. It was so cold that a thin layer of frost formed on the rocky walls in the tunnel. Just as she was about to pass out because of the cold, she finally reached the end of the tunnel—a neatly arranged chamber.

        On the chamber floor was a circling magic circle written with Sanskrit shimmering with a gentle glow imbued with power. Above it was a long box which seemed to be a casket.

        “Brahma’s secret must be inside this casket! I have to know it!”

        Normally, one would have walked away after sensing the anomalies and the smell of danger in the chamber. However, Varuni, blinded by her unusual obsession with Brahma, disregarded the incessant warnings from her intuition and resolutely approached the casket.

        Squeak—

        A piercing creak echoed in the chamber as Varuni strenuously pushed open the lid, and it only stopped after a moment. Without taking a moment to catch her breath, she eagerly leaned in to see what lay inside the box, only for her face to contort in shock.

        “This is… Shata!”

        Lying in the casket was a breathtakingly beautiful woman. Her eyes were tightly shut, her chest motionless; it was evident that she had fallen into an eternal slumber.

        ‘Brahma said Shata left him. Then why does he have her body here? …Could it be—’ Varuni scanned Shatarupa’s lifeless body and spotted a fatal wound on her abdomen.

        ‘Someone murdered Shata. There are only a few who could harm her given her formidable powers, so it could only be him… Brahma killed her…’

        The sudden realization jolted Varuni awake from her obsession with Brahma.

        ‘If he killed his own lover, Shata, what chance would I have as a woman he wouldn’t lay his eyes on? I’m aligned with Agni now. As long as he remains under Varuna’s favor, I can revel in wealth and glory, and bask in the adoration of thousands of men. There’s no need to waste my time and risk my life chasing a man who can kill his own lover at any second.’

        With newfound clarity, Varuni pushed the lid back in place. She decided to leave the chamber and distance herself from Brahma for the rest of her life. Unfortunately, she was a step too late.

        A warm hand quietly grasped the nape of Varuni’s neck. It was the touch she had once yearned for, but now, all she felt was an icy chill that ran down her spine.

        “Sigh… Varuni, why won’t you listen?” Brahma gently caressed Varuni’s skin as he whispered the “sweetest” words of a lover in her ears, “You’ve left me no choice. Someone who doesn’t listen shall never hear a word ever again.”

        Crack.

        Varuni’s neck twisted at an unimaginable angle. She did not even have a second to scream or gasp before she stepped into the eternal darkness… forever silence.</p>
