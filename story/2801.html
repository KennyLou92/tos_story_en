        <h1>Märchen Maker - Katherin</h1>
        <p>
                In a secluded forest, Katherin was practicing the painting magic her master had taught her. Filling her pen with runic power, she drew a few birds on a piece of white paper. Then as white light emitted from the paper, all the birds came to life and flew around her, making her chuckle. After a while, they disappeared into the air.

        “I wonder how many kinds of birds there are in this world.”

        Just then, Katherin heard the sound of crackling leaves. She was so frightened that she hid behind a tree, only to see a young man in armor walking into the forest alone. Her brows drew together in a frown as she noticed the sword sheathed on the man’s waist.

        In years of continuous wars, Katherin’s family—like most people on the continent—was caught in the wave. She was found by her current master, the Forest Witch, when she was still a baby. Under the witch’s nurture, she grew up studying the art of painting magic. Every once in a while, however, someone would break into the forest and disturb their lives. Some broke in by mistake while some came with malice, but either way, they were all banished by the Forest Witch.

        ‘This man came to the forest fully armed, he must be up to no good! Let me rout this intruder out of the forest!’ Katherin thought. As she drew on the paper, several beasts came to life and pounced on the young man.

        Katherin thought that she would see the young man being chased away by the beasts embarrassingly, but instead, she only heard a swish—the young man pulled out the sword on his waist. As his blades flashed like lightning, he defeated the beasts that Katherin had created one by one with a few swings.

        Just when Katherin was dumbfounded, mouth agape, by his sword techniques, the latter dashed to her in the blink of an eye after a hard kick on the ground. With his sword pointing at Katherin, the cold gleam of the blade stunned her.

        Only then did the young man find that the person hiding in the dark was a teenage girl. When he was about to retract his sword, a blast of strong wind blew him away. It was the Forest Witch, who descended from the sky riding a giant eagle.

        “Who are you? What are you doing in this forest?” The Forest Witch asked coldly as she stood in front of Katherin while pointing her staff at the young man.

        Seeing that, the young man immediately sheathed his sword. Making a deep bow to the witch, he said sincerely, “The Forest Witch, your mightiness, please forgive me for my insolence. My name is Nathaniel. We need your power to defeat those repulsive demons! Please help us to free the innocent people from this scourge of never-ending wars and end it once and for all!”

        However, the Forest Witch decisively turned down Nathaniel’s invitation and said, “No, I will not leave this forest and I hold no interest in the outside world. So leave, now.”

        The Forest Witch turned around and walked away. As much as Nathaniel wanted to catch up with her, his leg was held down by the tree roots that the witch had summoned with magic. Disheartened, he could only cut off the roots and left after a while.

        ‘The outside world…’ Katherine fell into contemplation. For she had never left the forest ever since she could remember, she basically knew nothing about the outside world so she could not help but begin to imagine.

        Curious about what the outside world looked like, Katherine chose to jump on the tree and follow Nathaniel. Unexpectedly, Nathaniel suddenly turned around and shot a leaf that whistled past Katherin’s ear. He was only trying to prank her but did not expect her to be so startled that she would fall from the tree.

        “Are you alright?” Nathaniel hurriedly went to Katherine. He nervously bandaged her wound as soon as he saw her knees bleeding from the fall.

        “I’m so sorry for pointing my sword at you just now and causing your injury. Here, take these cookies as a gift of my apology.” Nathaniel took out a small bag from his chest and gave it to Katherin. As the latter carefully took one of the cookies and took a bite, the crispy texture made her eyes light up.

        “These cookies are delicious! They must be expensive.”

        “There are many other kinds of desserts. These are all the specialties of my hometown.” Nathaniel’s gaze softened a lot when he talked about his hometown, which made Katherin begin to wonder what kind of place it was.

        “It must be a very nice place.”

        “Yeah, we’ve got magnificent rivers and mountains, a vast meadow, and golden paddy fields…”

        Different kinds of unseen scenery appeared in Katherin’s head as Nathaniel continued to describe his hometown, which only deepened her fascination with the outside world. Just when Katherin was almost intoxicated by what Nathaniel was depicting, his tone suddenly changed.

        “But now the demons have almost taken everything from us. That’s why I came here for the Forest Witch, hoping she could help us. Unfortunately… She has already shot me down.”

        “So what are you going to do now?”

        “I’m planning to find someone strong to join our team. Speaking of someone strong… Oh right, as the disciple of the witch, would you like to join us?”

        “Me? I… How can I? I’m not strong enough to join you.” Katherin lowered her head, yet Nathaniel still caught the gleam of uncertainty in her eyes.

        “Well… If you change your mind, come find me at the camp outside the forest tomorrow morning. As for your ability and strength, I think you’re already qualified to join us.” Nathaniel turned around and left soon after he said those words without giving Katherin a chance to respond.

        On that night, no matter how hard Katherin tried, she just could not push Nathaniel’s words out of her mind. Her curiosity about the outside world kept her awake the whole night and it was only until dawn did she realize what she truly desired.

        So she discreetly packed her bag. Just when she was about to open the door after leaving a farewell letter, a cold voice sounded behind her.

        “Where are you going?”

        “Ma-ma-master!” Katherin frantically lifted her head, only to find that her master was not as angry as she had expected. She seemed nonchalant as if she had known that Katherin would leave.

        “I… wish to see the world.”

        “The outside world is full of dangers. I can no longer protect you and you’ll have to live on your own once you step out of the forest. Do you understand?”

        “Yes, I know, but still, I want to go out and see. I have this feeling that there is something I can only understand after seeing the world outside, and only by doing so will my painting skill be improved,” said Katherin determinedly.

        “Since you have made up your mind, I shall not stop you. Take this with you.” The Forest Witch tossed Katherin a pen that held magic power with starry sparkles.

        “Thank you, Master!”

        After giving the Forest Witch a big hug, Katherine walked out of the forest and went to Nathaniel in the pleasant sunlight.</p>
