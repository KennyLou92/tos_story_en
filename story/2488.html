        Finale of Yamato - Ch.3

        Izanami took Kagutsuchi and Tsukuyomi to the abandoned village, but they were found by Izanagi and Amaterasu, who got into a quarrel with Izanami again regarding the child abduction.

        Tsukuyomi kept Amaterasu busy in order to keep her away from Izanami. Amaterasu became desperate as Izanagi was in grave danger.

        “Amaterasu, I’m not done with you yet! Where are you going?”

        “Tsukuyomi! It’s not play time now!”

        “I’ve missed you sooooooo much, Amaterasu. You gotta play with me.”

        Tsukuyomi consolidated her spiritual energy into purple threads. With a hand gesture, Tsukuyomi wrapped Amaterasu up with the threads like a cocoon! Just when she thought that she had her sister captured, the threads began to combust——Boom! Amaterasu broke free by using explosive fulus.

        “Impressive! There’s no fun if you lose so soon! Try this!”

        Waving her arm, Tsukuyomi casted a blade made of spiritual energy at Amaterasu. While Amaterasu concentrated on dodging the attack, Tsukuyomi lowered her body to press her palms against the ground. When Amaterasu stepped on the trap, Tsukuyomi pulled hard immediately, catching Amaterasu with the threads again!

        As Amaterasu was already taken captive, Tsukuyomi came over with a doll in her hand.

        “I can finally free the real Amaterasu from you imposter.”

        “Tsukuyomi...wake up! Stop letting the black magic control you!”

        “You’re not my family! You’re the fake Amaterasu!”

        “No! Me and Susanoo are with you. As long as we three together——”

        “SHUT UP!”

        Tsukuyomi reached Amaterasu, trying to pull a hair off from her. At this moment, Amaterasu shouted.

        “Explode!”

        Amaterasu broke free again by detonating the small fulu hidden in her hair accessory.

        The explosion forced Tsukuyomi to step back, whose face was scratched by the chippings. Wiping the blood away, she screamed, “give me back the real Amaterasu!”

        Acting in hysteria, Tsukuyomi launched fierce yet messy attacks at Amaterasu, who resolved them with two folding fans.

        As all the attacks went in vain, Tsukuyomi surged her spiritual energy for a new trick. All of a sudden, Kagutsuchi, who was lacking focuses in his eyes, pointed his sword at Amaterasu.

        “K-Kagutsuchi? What happened to you?” Amaterasu was anxious.

        “The thought suddenly hits me...I think you’d rather play with Kagutsuchi than me.”

        As Tsukuyomi moved her fingers, Kagutsuchi began to move agilely, charging at Amaterasu with his sword.

        The shock had Amaterasu reacting slower than usual, who was too late to dodge a kick after a sword hit. Kicked by Kagutsuchi, Amaterasu was smashed onto the wall of an abandoned house. Injured by the momentum, she coughed blood while lying on the ground immobilized.

        “I can finally free you, Amaterasu.”

        Tsukuyomi moved her fingers again and puppeteered Kagutsuchi to stab Amaterasu! At that critical moment, someone descended from above and fended off the deadly hit for Amaterasu——

        “Ugh. Are you two sisters fighting again?”
