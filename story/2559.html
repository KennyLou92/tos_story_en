        <h1>Unified Blades - Minamoto no Yoshitsune</h1>
        <p>
                Imanotsurugi and Usumidori each held a sword in their hands and approached the helpless White Queen with a sinister smile. Just then, the severely injured Yoshitsune, who sensed the love of his life was on the brink of danger, came out of the coma and blocked the swords of Imanotsurugi and Usumidori with the long one hung on the wall, guarding the White Queen behind him.

        Looking at the assailants, Yoshitsune felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity. He soon recognized them when he saw the long and the short dark swords on their hands.

        ‘Imanotsurugi, Usumidori… Why are you…’

        ‘Yeah, why?’

        ‘Of course, it’s because you’re incompetent to be our master so we’ve decided to send you all to hell! Hahahaha!’ Together, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori let out a wild and derisive laugh. Meanwhile, the mounting strength on the two swords pressing against Yoshitsune almost brought him to his knees.

        ‘You’re too weak. I feel ashamed to even call you my master,’ Imanotsurugi said.
        ‘Do you know why you can never beat Lü Bu?’ asked Usumidori.
        ‘It’s because of the woman behind you,’ said Imanotsurugi. ‘You can never turn completely evil as long as she lives.’
        ‘How delusional are you to think that you can defeat him without mastering the evil pneuma? Bah!’ disdained Usumidori.

        “Am I really…wrong? Is abandoning Snowdrop the only way to get power?”

        As though the evil pneuma could sense Yoshitsune’s hesitation, it started to dim and weaken.

        ‘Ahahahaha, even the evil pneuma abandoned him!’ said Imanotsurugi.
　　
        ‘Our foolish former master and the White Queen, now go to hell!’ An immense wave of evil pneuma flooded out from the swords in the hands of Imanotsurugi and Usumidori.

        In the split second when the slash was about to hit Yoshitsune, he saw his life flashed before his eyes——

        Reluctant to being a bird in a cage, he ran away from his family, which eventually led him to the path of suicide.
        He was then resurrected, brainwashed, and manipulated as someone’s lackey.
        His mind was bent on getting revenge even after he had gotten rid of his control.
        Is defeating Lü Bu really that important?

        ‘No! No one is as important as Snowdrop!’ Yoshitsune shouted loudly. In an instant, his turbulent heart became crystal-clear while evil pneuma overflowed as if it had broken free from shackles and even pulled the evil pneuma of the two dark swords back to Yoshitsune’s body.

        On top of that, the evil pneuma even climbed up the blades and engulfed Imanotsurugi and Usumidori in a flash. The two felt a strong power that kept dragging them back to the swords.

        ‘He is dragging us back to the sword,’ said Imanotsurug in disbelief.
        ‘No, no way!’ Usumidori glared angrily at Yoshitsune.
        ‘You must be kidding me!’ Growling together, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori struggled to get away from the control of the evil pneuma. Still, they failed and got pulled back to the swords.

        ‘Argh!’ Reaching his limit, Yoshitsune finally fell on his knees. Just then, the White Queen regained her consciousness. Seeing the terribly pale Yoshitsune, she immediately went over and held him.

        ‘Yoshitsune, are you alright?’ The White Queen’s eyes were filled be visible worries. Smiling, Yoshitsune stretched his hand and stroked her cheek. His eyes were clear and cloudless as never before.
 
        ‘I’m fine… It's just that I’ve figured out what I truly want.’

        “It was never what I want to defeat anyone; all I want is to protect her and stay with her both now and forevermore.” Relieved, Yoshitsune thought.

        Yoshitsune, who let go of his obsession with defeating Lü Bu, sealed the two dark swords for good inside his body. It no longer mattered to the White Queen and Yoshitsune, even though they were to be trapped in Wonderland forever.</p>
