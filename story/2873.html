        <h1>Implausible Panacea - Zhang Guolao</h1>
        <p>        Zhang Guolao had been plagued by chronic pain in his knee recently. Fortunately, he learned about a famous massage parlor that specializes in bone pain from other Xians. It was rumored that the massage practitioner in that parlor—who was also known as the Xian of Bones—could dispel any bone pain.

        Exasperated by the knee pain, Zhang Guolao immediately descended to the human realm where the massage parlor was located. Yet, his knees began to ache as he looked at the seemingly endless flight of stairs in front of the parlor.

        “Ow, ow… No, I can do this. I’m just a staircase away from getting cured… The pain will be gone for good once I see the Xian of Bones…”

        Finally, after much effort, Zhang Guolao managed to climb the long staircase and make it to the massage parlor, only to find a small sign hanging on the door that said, “Closed.”

        Zhang Guolao breathed a long sigh, trying to alleviate the pain through a deep breath. Just as he was about to return home in disappointment, he heard the cries of a woman coming from inside the massage parlor.

        “I can’t just do nothing when there is someone causing harm!” Zhang Guolao muttered to himself.

        Enduring the pain in his knee, Zhang Guolao rushed into the house, inside of which he saw a monkey wielding a red rod, relentlessly beating a plump and beautiful woman.

        “Stop!” 

        Zhang Guolao shouted, gathering his Xian energy at his fingertips to form a ball of light that shot toward the monkey. Yet, the monkey swiftly blocked his attack with the rod.

        “Who dares to attack me, Sun Wukong!” The money, also known as Sun Wukong, roared angrily. He charged to the front of Zhang Guolao in an instant, raising his rod to strike. Zhang Guolao narrowly dodged the attack by turning his body to the side.

        Yet, Sun Wukong was unyielding—he changed his attack from a downward strike to a sweeping motion.

        Zhang Guolao intended to duck and evade the attack. However, the pain in his knee flared up, causing his movements to falter. As a result, Sun Wukong’s red rod hit his knee directly, which, unexpectedly, struck the misaligned bone back into place with a crisp sound, putting an end to the constant disturbing pain in just a second.

        “What… I’m cured!” Zhang Guolao thought in delight. His once stiff movements suddenly became fluid, allowing him to counter Sun Wukong’s attacks. This sparked Sun Wukong’s combative spirit, and his moves became even more fierce."  

        The Xian and the monkey engaged in a fierce exchange of punches and rod strikes. Shadows of their fists and rod flashed in the air, causing gusts of explosive wind between them. The intensity of their fight ignited excitement in the onlooking woman, causing her whole body to tremble like a leaf.

        Eventually, the woman who was unable to contain her inner desires impulsively rushed into the middle of the two’s intense clash of fists and rod, taking two heavy blows at the same time.

        The woman slumped to the ground upon impact. Zhang Guolao quickly ceased his attacks and approached her with concern. He asked, “Are you alright—”

        “Ohhhh— That was amazing!” The woman, Lady White Bones, abruptly lifted her head and exclaimed with joy. Excitement and satisfaction painted her delicate face with a rosy glow.

        The woman’s unusual reaction left Zhang Guolao puzzled. He turned to Sun Wukong, who was standing nearby, and asked, “What... What is going on?”

        “It’s obvious. This demon loves getting beaten by others. She insisted on me hitting her, so I got annoyed and tried to beat her away,” Sun Wukong explained.

        “Yes. And Sir, your punches were quite impressive. The teamwork between you two just now was marvelous. Can you do it again?” Lady White Bones eagerly invited. Her excitement was evident.
　　
        “Well… I didn’t know the demons in the human realm have become so strange these days. It appears that I have stayed in the Heavenly Kingdom for such a long time,” Zhang Guolao sighed lightly.

        “Nope. She’s the only strange one here,” Sun Wukong replied, heading toward the door. “Well, I still have some business to do. But maybe we can spar again another time.”

        “No! Wait—” Although Lady White Bones tried to chase after Sun Wukong, the latter swiftly leaped onto a cloud and disappeared into the sky.

        “Tut! He ran away!” Lady White Bones muttered. Then, she turned around and looked at Zhang Guolao, flashing a smile that was both appeasing and scheming. She slowly approached the Xian.

        “Um, now that I see you’re fine, it’s time for me to leave.” Zhang Guolao, who smelled trouble, quickly turned around and leaped out of the window, as if he feared that Lady White Bones would catch up to him, showing an agility far beyond his age as he escaped from the massage parlor…</p>
