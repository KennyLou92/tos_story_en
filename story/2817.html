        <h1>Volatile Spin - Jinnie</h1>
        <p>        Little Jinnie loved making spinning tops. One day, she ventured into the forest near the town to look for some wood pieces.
　　
        Focusing on finding the materials, Jinnie unknowingly walked into the depths of the forest where she had never been before. With towering trees standing in the depths of the forest, there was just a dapple of sunlight that helped Jinnie see where the wood pieces were.

        After hunting around, Jinnie finally gathered enough wood pieces. When she was about to head back home, a girl’s scream suddenly ripped through the air and startled the birds that were perching on the branches.

        “Someone must be in danger! I have to help her!” Jinnie thought anxiously. She ran toward the sound and found a ground of demons in the dappled sunlight, so she immediately hid behind a tree.

        Jinnie stealthily stuck her head out to see what the demons were doing. The demons were surrounding a girl about her age with one of them drawing his dagger to stab the girl.

        At the critical juncture, Jinnie forgot her fear and rushed toward the demon despite her own safety. Without seeing the attack, the demon was knocked onto the ground and the dagger slipped out of his hand. Jinnie immediately picked up the dagger and pointed it at the demons, shouting with all her strength, “Go-go away! Or-or else I will stab you!”

        Clearly, the demon leader did not see Jinnie as a threat, and thus he snorted, “Humph! You?”

        At the leader’s signal, one of his underlings charged at Jinnie and punched her to the ground. Jinnie fell heavily right next to the girl.

        The demon’s punch made Jinnie’s face swell. However, even though it hurt, she held back her tears, got back up shakily, and stood before the girl again to protect her.

        The girl looked at Jinnie quietly. Jinnie, who thought that the girl must be lost for words due to fear, bore the pain and forced a smile, saying, “Don’t worry. I’ll protect you.”

        Seeing Jinnie’s ludicrous move, the demon leader then said, “I’m telling you she is the only one I want! So beat it before I kill you too!”

        “No! I won’t!” said Jinnie firmly while straightening her little back.

        “What a foolish girl! Now die!” The demon leader raised his hand to thrust his dagger at Jinnie’s throat. Knowing she could not dodge it, Jinnie subconsciously closed her eyes. To her surprise, the expected pain did not come.

        Jinnie opened her eyes only to find the girl behind her back had come to her front before she knew it. Holding her right arm, the girl summoned a transparent shield to block the demon’s attack.

        “You’re the fool. You moron.” The girl gave a disdainful snort and waved her left hand. Then, a blade of light in a crescent shape swept through the demons around them and knocked them all down.

        As soon as the crisis was over, Jinnie fell to her knees and looked at the girl in surprise. “So you are strong…”

        “Why didn’t you run?” the girl asked in an uncannily imposing manner that did not match her age. Jinnie answered the question obediently, “Because if I left, you would be alone. Being alone is scary, but it will be fine if there’s another person with you.”

        The girl sneered, “You may not be smart, but you have such pure kindness that is rare to find in this world… My name is Woodbury. We’ll meet again someday when you have a wish to fulfill.”

        “When exactly will that be… Huh? She’s gone…” Jinnie lifted her head to ask, only to find that Woodbury had disappeared without a trace…</p>
