        <h1>Graceful Shield Dancer - Thetis</h1>
        <p>        If you ask Thetis what is Achilles to her, her answer as the Savant of Rules would probably be her warrior or her spear but never her son. It wasn’t until Achilles died on the battlefield that she realized the motherly feeling she had for him.

        However, it was already too late by the time she came to the realm of humans. Achilles was long dead and turned into a Demon who only knew butchery.  To rectify her mistakes, Thetis decided to restore this flesh and divine power to her body. Little did she know that it would be nothing but a greater misstep.

        Unified with Achilles, her mind was then distorted. Together they became a manifestation of vengeance and madness. She had also become the one that Achilles abhorred the most from the bottom of his heart.

        To Achilles, she was his mother who yet denied him and wanted to obliterate him. Thetis could feel his animosity towards her sliding into her heart all the time.

        Her justice, her rules, and her divine power eventually led to such a tragedy. Suffering from the torture of self-blame, absurdity, and bemoaning, Thetis’s mind slowly fell into darkness.

        Until this moment, Giemsa, the Goddess of Order, pulled her out of Achilles’s body to the cold floor.

        “The Savant of Rules, Thetis.”

        It had been such a long long time since anyone had called her name, so Thetis looked at Giemsa in confusion, “Giemsa…”

        “Do you know what you’ve done?”

        Looking back on these days, the rules she had broken and all the lives taken by her and Achilles, Thetis hung his head and said, “...Yes, I know.”

        “Do you know what kind of punishment is awaiting you?”

        Thetis, who was the Savant of Rules, answered Giemsa’s question immediately without thinking, “Soul annihilation. My soul will be completely destroyed.”

        With a bitter smile, Thetis subconsciously looked at Achilles, who was still lying unconscious on the floor. The consternation on her face was nowhere to hide.

        “But this child is innocent! It’s all my fault! Goddess Giemsa, please spare Achilles! Please have mercy on my child!”

        “Now that without your divine power, the demonic blood has circulated through his whole body in an instant. He can never wake up again, and I don’t even have to do anything.”

        Thetis went pale after hearing her words. She then walked to Achilles and stroked his cheek gently. For Achilles’s unconsciousness, she couldn’t unify herself with him again.

        With her dagger, she gashed her wrist. As the warm divine blood wetted the corners of Achilles’s mouth, his body slowly absorbed the divine power, yet the amount of blood was far from enough to balance out the demonic blood inside him.

        “It doesn’t matter what happens to me. Let my soul be annihilated if it is the way it should be. I know I am the farthest from being called a good mother, not to mention all the sins I’ve committed. But I beg you… I will give you everything I have in the realm of gods! You can even take my soul and use it as you like… I just beg you to save my only son!”

        Giemsa closed her eyes. That split second felt like forever for Thetis. After a moment, Giemsa lifted her hands and rebuilt Achilles’s body with Thetis’s blood as a guide and her own power as his bones.

        Flashes of light covered Achilles’s body one after another.

        “Now, are you happy?” When the light faded, Giemsa asked the deathly pale Thetis, who had lost all her divine power, lying on the verge of bleeding out.

        “Yes, thank you.”

        “Then it’s time that you receive your punishment.”

        Under the emotionless adjudication of Giemsa, Theis closed her eyes and awaited her death with a peaceful smile on the bottom stair."

        “Now, are you happy?” When the light faded, Giemsa asked the deathly pale Thetis, who had lost all her divine power, lying on the verge of bleeding out.

        “Yes, thank you.’

        “Then it’s time that you receive your punishment.”

        Under the emotionless adjudication of Giemsa, Theis closed her eyes and awaited her death with a peaceful smile on the bottom stair.</p>
