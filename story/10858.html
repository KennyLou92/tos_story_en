        <h1>Crusch Karsten & Ferris</h1>
        <p>
        Crusch Karsten is one of the Royal Candidates for the throne of the Kingdom of Lugunica and the Duchess of Karsten. 
Innately charismatic, she is a genius who succeeded her family’s title at a young age. She has been seen as a front-runner in the Royal Selection, but she loses all her memories after being attacked by the Sin Archbishops following the battle against the White Whale. She is blessed with the Divine Protection of Wind Reading, which allows her to see through lies.

Ferris is Crusch’s knight. He is also a renowned healing magic-user in the capital of the Kingdom of Lugunica where he fights alongside his master in the Royal Selection. He has the demeanor of a lovely girl dressed in frilly clothes with soft cat ears on the head. Though his actions and words seem a bit flamboyant, it oddly suits him. He is unswervingly loyal to his master, Crusch, whom he has known for years. Their bond is particularly strong compared to that of the other Royal Candidates and their knights. He is indeed a male.</p>
