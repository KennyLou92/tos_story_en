        <h1>Kamina & Gurren</h1>
        <p>Growing up with Simon in Giha Village, Kamina is more mature in age. His red sunglasses and blue tattoos on his upper body are the signature of his appearance.

Boisterous, fearless and determined, Kamina puts his absolute trust in Simon all along. They are sworn brothers after having been through many tough battles.

As the first leader of Team Dai-Gurren, Kamina is full of charisma; he is also the pilot of Gunmen "Gurren".

"Gurren" was captured from the enemy by Kamina, and modified for his own use.  The Gunmen has massive sunglasses that resemble Kamina's. It can be combined with "Lagann" to acquire stronger power.
