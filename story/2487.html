        <h1>Resilient Love - Izanagi</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Yamato - Ch.2

        After getting to know the origin of the book of black magic, Izanagi and Amaterasu set off to the abandoned village where everything had begun. However, they found a bunch of kidnapped children.

        At this moment, Izanami showed up together with Tsukuyomi. Izanami longed for Izanagi’s understanding, yet all she had was his hostile question. Devastated, she integrated with the evil spirit in the black magic.

        “Talking is redundant if you’ll never understand me!”

        As Izanami was done speaking, she surged her wicked spiritual energy and charged at Izanagi, attacking him with the pale arms grown from her back. While Izanagi was barely dodging the attacks, he noticed something——The fiercer her attack was, the more she got corrupted by the black magic!

        “I’ll get killed if I don’t do something...but...I couldn’t hurt my beloved wife…”

        It only took Izanagi a second of hesitation to get himself subdued by Izanami’s pale arms.

        “Die!” Izanami raised her arm to thrust at Izanagi’s chest.

        At that critical moment, the protective fulu that Izanagi had been carrying was triggered. As the blinding light dazzled, Izanami was blasted away.

        “I WON’T LET YOU SMITE ME!” Lying on the ground, Izanami screamed in hysteria.

        A black evil aura was exuded under her feet, rising all the way up. Even her white clothes were stained black. The aura eventually diffused into her eyes and turned into black tears, rolling down on her cheeks.

        Izanagi knew clearly that it was the body reaction when one was devoured by the black magic!

        The mentally collapsed Izanami created a strong encirclement that kept everyone away from her.

        Despite the foreseeable harm, Izanagi moved his steps towards Izanami as he was determined to save his wife from the black magic.

        “Hmm!”

        Izanagi moaned painfully, but he put up with the pain and continued to go further.

        The closer Izanagi got, the more wounds were cut open on his body. Very soon, his limbs and face were covered with bleeding scratches. By the time he made his way to Izanami, he was already bloodsoaked. If it was for an ordinary person, he would’ve passed out already.

        It was the will of saving his wife that supported Izanagi. Standing next to Izanami, he pulled her into his arms gently and spoke to her softly. 

        “Izanami, I’m sorry that I left you to face everything alone. Don’t worry. I’ll share your burden from now on. So come home.”

        Izanagi unleashed every bit of his spiritual energy to counteract Izanami’s evil aura. At that moment, the encirclement trembled and cracked; the darkness possessing her began to fade away. Meanwhile, he felt a stingy pain from his eyes.

        In Izanagi’s eyes, the image of Izanami became blurry. Soon, his eyesight was reduced to nothing but complete darkness. Not only the blindness, but his hair turned white due to the overconsumption of spiritual energy…

        When Izanagi was about to fall down, he was held by someone gently.

        Although he could not see, he knew it was Izanami, whose evil aura had been exorcised, with her eyes becoming limpid like the moon.

        “Izanagi...I’m sorry,” Izanami wept.

        “It’s okay as long as you're back.”

        The two hugged each other tightly, but they didn’t notice that the evil aura had crept away towards Tsukuyomi...
