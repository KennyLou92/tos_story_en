        <h1>Displaced Innocence - Sodom</h1>
        <p>
        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 8

        An enormous beast walked through a narrow tunnel, carrying a humanoid girl, around thirteen or fourteen years old, in his mouth. The girl struggled relentlessly, hindering the beast in his steps. Irritated, the beast violently hurled the girl against the wall.

        “Ah!” The girl whimpered in pain as she fell to the ground. Her ethereally delicate face and her vulnerably slender limbs exuded a sense of enchanting fragility which only stimulated the sadistic essence lurking within the beast. Succumbing to temptation, the beast pressed his paw on the girl’s body and elicited a groan of pain from her.

        “How dare you resist me? What a foolish prisoner!” sneered the phantocauda, staring at the girl who was actually a gladiospina.

        When a gladiospina comes into the world, they appear in the likeness of a sword. As the passage of time stirs their awakening, they take on a hybrid form, part dragon and part human, and only after a period of time do they unveil their true essence as a dragon. In their complete dragon form, the very core of the gladiospina, bearing the name of the core sword, anchors upon their body and becomes an epitome of indomitable might as it harmonizes with the gladiospina’s growth and amasses a reservoir of magic powers.

        It was such transcendent powers that made the gladiospinas a coveted target for other races and clans. It was also the reason the girl, Sodom, was imprisoned in the phantocauda abode since her mother, Mistilteinn, abducted by the rapacious phantocaudas, made a deal with Zeboiim, the phantocauda chieftain so that she could live until her child’s birth after discovering her pregnancy. However, soon after Sodom’s awakening, Zeboiim ruthlessly ordered his subordinate, the male phantocauda, to take the girl away from her mother’s embrace.

        Sodom’s defiance, coupled with the painful humiliation of past encounters with gladiospinas, provoked the male phantocauda’s resentment, prompting him to direct his anger at the innocent girl. Thus, he intensified his press on her, his eyes widening with excitement and pleasure. Unleashing his innate savagery, he cruelly declared, “Now let me give you a hard lesson!”

        “Stop!” a female voice rang out as a beast pounced forward, knocking down the male phantocauda before he could strike. Despite her rather petite physique, the female phantocauda exuded a formidable presence. She was Gomorrah, the daughter of the chieftain, Zeboiim.

        “How dare you lay your hand on my sword!” Gomorrah bared her teeth, pressing her sharp fangs against the male phantocauda’s vulnerable neck as a menacing threat. 

        “I… I… I…” The male phantocauda trembled, unable to form a coherent sentence.

        “Now get out!” Gomorrah released her grip, her beastly eyes staring down the male phantocauda as she growled throatily. Reluctantly, the male phantocauda tucked his tail and left, leaving Gomorrah and Sodom alone. 

        “Sodom! Are you alright?” Gomorrah immediately walked to the wall, leaning down to look at Sodom, whose fair skin bore bruises from the male phantocauda’s abuse.

        “It’s all my fault,” Gomorrah said remorsefully, “I came too late.”

        “Who…are you?” Sodom looked at Gomorrah, extending a hand to touch her front paw. The warm touch sparked a sense of inexplicable familiarity within her. “I feel like… I’ve seen you before…”

        “I am Gomorrah, and you are my one and only sword,” said Gomorrah, gently coiling her tail around Sodom, “And I shall protect you always and forever.”

        ‘She…is kind… I like her… I like Gomorrah.’ Sodom turned her thoughts into action, returning the affectionate words by hugging the massive tail and nuzzling against it playfully.

        However, such a heart-warming moment was soon shattered by a shocking piece of news—Mistilteinn killed Zeboiim.

        Zeboiim’s death plunged Gomorrah into a political struggle for the throne, leaving her torn between responsibilities. Meanwhile, Sodom was imprisoned as a criminal in the dungeon until days later when the phantocauda brought her to a chamber with handcuffs on her wrists and chains on her ankle to face the clan’s judgment.

        “Her mother murdered our chieftain! We must put her to death!” one of the phantocaudas angrily requested.
“That would be too easy for her! We must torture her before we kill her!”
“Yeah, and we should send her corpse back to those gladiospinas, to show our strength!”

        Seething with rage, the phantocaudas urged for a condemnation of the murderer’s daughter. Yet, for Sodom, who had recently awakened, their words were far beyond her comprehension. Still, she could sense an overwhelming malice and hatred in their voice, which sent an uncontrollable tremor through her delicate fame.

        Sodom closed her eyes, attempting to escape the onslaught of the profane and vile language, but to no avail, so she could only pray, ‘Someone… Someone… Please help me…’

        As if answering her plea, a beast stormed into the room, standing tall before Sodom like an impenetrable wall that shielded her from harm.

        “Go… Gomorrah…” Sodom called out the beast’s name with a sense of affection. Although Sodom had not seen Gomorrah again ever since she saved her from the abusive male phantocauda, she had not forgotten the promise Gomorrah had made.

        “No one is going to lay a finger on her,” Gomorrah declared in a deep voice as she surveyed the surrounding phantocaudas.

        “Gomorrah, what do you mean?” a young phantocauda stepped forward and questioned her.

        “My father gave her to me, so it is my right to decide how to deal with her.”

        “Are you trying to protect her? Her mother killed your father! She is your enemy!”

        Unexpectedly, Gomorrah forcefully lashed her tail on Sodom’s smooth cheek, leaving a crimson mark with fresh blood trickling from its edges.

        Powerless, Sodom could only let out a whimper and kneel on the ground pitifully.

        “Heh, who told you I was going to protect her? I hate her more than anyone else in this chamber,” Gomorrah grinned and continued, “Mere physical torture is not enough to ease my grief; only the despair that consumes one’s soul can complete my revenge.”

        “So, what are you going to do with her?”

        “Exploit her, of course. I’m going to nurture her, make her my slaughtering tool, and use her against the gladiospinas, her own kin… Doesn’t that sound a lot more fun?”

        All the phantocaudas in the chamber fell into silence for a moment upon hearing Gomorrah’s words until Admah bellowed with laughter and praised, “Impressive! You’re certainly your father’s daughter! I can see a trace of his madness in your brilliantly wicked plan. Well, I have no objections to leaving the gladiospina to you. Does anyone disagree?”

        With no further objections from other beasts, Gomorrah roughly yanked on Sodom’s chains and strode away. With her limbs chained, the girl inevitably slipped and fell to the ground. Undeterred, Gomorrah callously dragged her back to the dungeon, letting the cruel friction gnaw at her delicate skin and leaving crimson trails upon her knees.

        After the doors closed, there was only a shaft of light in the gloomy and oppressive dungeon where Sodom, weak and drained, sat down on the ground helplessly. Yet, she soon found herself in a warm embrace as Gomorrah transformed into her human form and drew her into her arms. With her tail curled around them tightly, they looked like two inseparable twins.

        “I’m sorry… Sodom… I’m so sorry… This is the only way I could think of to save you,” Gomorrah said, her voice carrying guilt and exhaustion.

        “Gomorrah, Sodom likes Gomorrah… even if it’s painful,” Sodom said without any resentment while returning Gomorrah’s embrace. An innocent and radiant smile spread over her wounded face, her eyes sparkling with blazing light as she looked at Gomorrah. There was nothing but pure trust and admiration in her gaze.

        Sodom continued to trust Gomorrah wholeheartedly despite the pain Gomorrah had inflicted on her. It was Sodom’s unconditional trust and kindness that made Gomorrah want to indulge herself in her embrace even more, but she knew she could not do so. 

        Her covetous kin awaited her mistake, waiting for the chieftain’s daughter to lose her laurels, and she was well aware that Sodom would be in an even more precarious place once she lost her power. Therefore, she put on a pretense and suppressed her desire to be with Sodom. Only when she ventured out for another slaughter, would she go to the dungeon and take Sodom with her, repeating the brutal cycle of bloodshed, eradicating other races one after another.

        In one of her many massacres, Gomorrah surveyed the land strewn with lifeless bodies. With putrid air filling her nostrils, she felt her once soft heart gradually hardening. As time passed, Gomorrah grew more reserved, the faint trace of emotions on her face replaced by a cold and indifferent expression as if something had shrunk within her with each act of slaughter.

        Sodom, who had been watching Gomorrah, did not understand the change. However, her heart involuntarily ached whenever she saw Gomorrah wearing such an expression. In those moments, Sodom would hold Gomorrah tightly with her hands around her waist, as if trying to shield her with her body.

        Lifting her youthful face, Sodom asked, “Killing them, doesn’t make Gomorrah happy?”

        Gomorrah shook her head, then solemnly explained, “But it’s too late. What we’ve done is unforgivable, and as the chieftain of the phantocaudas, I am the first one to blame…”

        “Sodom, loves Gomorrah, whatever Gomorrah looks like!” Sodom urgently interrupted. She tightened her embrace even more as if to show her determination, which brought a smile to Gomorrah’s face as she put her arms around Sodom’s petite body.

        “Well, I love you too, Sodom,” she responded tenderly.

        However, even the strongest love could not stop the malice of fate.

        As the war between the beasts and the elves escalated, other races were inevitably embroiled, and the gladiospinas were one of them. With the gladiospinas saving the elves in multiple instances, a seed of hatred began to sprout within the phantocaudas, and eventually, some proposed initiating a preemptive attack on the gladiospinas.

        Despite Gomorrah’s attempts to negotiate a truce, she failed to change her kin’s mind. Ultimately, she had no choice but to comply and lead her army to the gladiospinas’ abode where they mounted a fierce assault.

        As usual, Sodom accompanied Gomorrah to the battlefield. Yet, different from any past battles, Gomorrah, whether by deliberate design or not, assigned her to a logistics position to guard against any unexpected moves from the gladiospinas.

        Yet, an inexplicable unease crept up on Sodom, perhaps because of the unusual experience of losing sight of Gomorrah. Finally, unable to overcome the growing apprehension, she rushed to the front lines regardless of another phantocauda’s interception. There, she witnessed a scene that made her heart skip a beat—two core swords ready to impale Gomorrah’s body!

        ‘No! Gomorrah! I must protect her!’ Sodom immediately tapped into her powers and transformed into a giant sword. She charged fiercely from a distance, colliding head-on with the two threatening swords before Gomorrah.

        Despite the dizziness caused by the impact, Sodom reverted to her human form and pounced in front of Gomorrah, gazing at her with pure concern filling her ethereally beautiful face.

        “Mistilteinn...” murmured Tyrfing, the gladiospina who had just attacked Gomorrah, with an inexplicable fondness as he looked at the girl who crashed into the battlefield.

        However, the feeling was not mutual. Grasping her core sword, Sodom pointed it at Tyrfing and glared at him with pure enmity, “You hurt Gomorrah! I hate you! Die!”</p>
