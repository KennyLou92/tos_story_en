        <h1>Strings of Liturgy - Lyra</h1>
        <p>        Lyra, the constellation who had acquired the chaotic power, ran into the battlefield between the gods and the Zodiacs and vowed to take revenge on her former owner—Persephone, the Court of Virgo. A pitched battle broke out between the two. Lyra thought that Persephone had forgotten her; to her surprise, the latter recognized her at the very last minute.

        A huge crack appeared on the ground, slowly moving Lyra and Persephone apart to the sides. The pillars around them kept crumbling one after another. Judging that the situation had become perilous, Armstrong promptly carried Persephone in his arms, trying to take her away from the battlefield. However, Persephone broke away from his arms and dashed toward Lyra as fast as she could.

        ‘Lyra!’

        Watching as Persephone ran toward herself while jumping over the crack, Lyra could not help but feel dazed. Yet, a beguiling voice sounded in her head, “Didn’t you always want to kill her? Now it’s the best chance! Despite all the effort you had taken to protect her, she left you behind alone for many years, remember?” 

        Induced by the strange voice in her head, Lyra ruthlessly lifted her hands, her palms facing Persephone with a threatening ball of intertwined purple and golden light coalescing in the middle.

        ‘Persephone! Watch out!’ Armstrong warned Persephone, who did not seem to hear him.

        “Shouldn’t she be afraid that I will kill her?” The closer Persephone came to her unguardedly, the more flustered Lyra felt. In the end, she did not get the chance to launch the attack as she fell into Persephone’s arms.

        The warm embrace brought tears to Lyra’s eyes. With Persephone’s tenderness melting her frozen heart, her true emotions eventually broke the wall and turned into the most authentic words that had been long buried in her heart, ‘I have been waiting for you. I kept telling myself that you would never abandon me, but when I finally saw you again, you told me you didn’t know me, and that breaks my heart so, so badly.’

        ‘I’m sorry, Lyra. It’s all my fault. I didn’t know back then.’ Persephone held Lyra tighter. With guilt and remorse spreading over her pretty face, she said with a choked sob, ‘I am so sorry for keeping you waiting. I will never leave you again.’

        ‘That’s all I want, just staying with you forever——’ Suddenly, a wormhole appeared in the air and interrupted Lyra’s words— a hand stretched out from the wormhole. Then the purple mist at its fingertip turned into a monstrous bird that swooped down on Persephone with tremendous power.

        ‘Look out!’ At the moment of peril, Lyra blocked the attack without a second thought, just like back in the days when she did everything to protect Persephone.

        As the monstrous bird slammed into Lyra’s chest, it disappeared into her body and started a wanton and dominating rampage inside her, bringing her excruciating pain as if her body was torn apart.

        ‘AHHHHHH——!’ Lyra let out a shrill scream in pain.

        ‘Lyra!’ Persephone wanted to hold Lyra but the latter pushed her away.

        ‘Go… Go… NOW!’ Lyra shouted in agony. Meanwhile, a dense purple mist closed in and shrouded her body.

        Persephone shook her head and said determinedly, ‘No, I’ve said it. I will never leave you again!’

        With a wave of Persephone’s right hand, a scythe-shaped harp appeared in her hand. Summoning her astralist power, she nimbly plucked the strings. The sound of the harp then turned into beams of dazzling golden light that shot at the purple mist around Lyra and purified it.

        The war-scarred ground and walls continued to crumble and fall apart at the clash of powers. Even so, Persephone did not waver but kept playing the melodious tune unremittingly.

        Seeing the determination in Persephone’s eyes, Armstrong quietly blasted the fallen pillars away from her so that she could continue to play the harp.

        By then, Lyra had already floated into the air. With her body cloaked in the purple mist, she looked like a purple cocoon from a distance. The chaotic power was gnawing away at her mind along with her emotions and memories, taking away all the precious pieces of the past from her and sapping her strength. She could hardly do anything but fell into the bottomless darkness…

        ——Twangle.

        Like a pebble that was thrown into a placid lake, the refreshing sound of the harp aroused Lyra’s tumultuous mind. As Lyra opened her eyes, she saw a thread of golding light shining in the boundless darkness. It was the same color as her favorite master’s hair.

        “...We shall stay together forever.” The maiden’s soothing voice echoed in the world of chaos, bringing power to Lyra.

        “Yeah, we made a promise that we will stay together forever.” Lyra abruptly opened her eyes wide and unlocked the astralist power inside her. “So I can’t be devoured! I don’t want to disappear!”

        The golden light bloomed in Lyra’s body, shining through the cocoon of purple mist. The next moment, a pair of magnificent wings of light broke the cocoon and spread majestically, dispelling all the ominous purple mist.

        Flapping her wings, Lyra flew to Persephone and Armstrong. As she landed gracefully, she was drawn to a tight embrace before she could steady herself.

        ‘Thank goodness! You’re fine!’ Persephone said with overwhelming joy, ‘We will never be apart this time!’

        However, contrary to the joyous Persephone, Lyra gave her a melancholic smile and said, ‘No. Persephone, I’m afraid I have to leave you for a while.’

        ‘What are you talking about…’ Persephone was confused, but soon she saw the fading body of Lyra. She said in disbelief, ‘How could it be… We did dispel that purple mist! But why are you fading?’

        ‘I used too much energy to get rid of the chaotic power.’

        ‘No… No…’ Watching as Lyra’s body faded away, Persephone could not help but burst into tears. Lyra reached out a hand to gently wipe the tears for her, then she said softly, ‘Persephone, please don’t cry. I’m just taking a break, a short break. I’ll be back soon, so…’

        Standing on tiptoe, Lyra planted a kiss on Persephone’s cheek and said with a smile, ‘Wait for me.’

        After leaving those words, Lyra’s body completely disappeared whereas a dingy little harp appeared in Persephone’s arms. Stroking the harp lovingly, Persephone whispered, ‘Sure. I’ll be the one waiting this time.’</p>
