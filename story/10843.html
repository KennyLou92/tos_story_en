        <h1>Fortified Pagoda - Yandi</h1>
        <p>        While everyone was rushing to restaurants for lunch in the bustling town center at midday, a man stood out, his leisurely footsteps starkly different from the hurried masses. Dressed in a colorful robe, he strolled through the throng with a gilded paper fan in one hand. His strikingly handsome features and tall stature made him a figure of elegance that seemed to rise above the ceaseless currents of mortal life.

        The man was known as Yandi, one of the three Divine Xians who guarded the Treasure Pagoda in the Heavenly Kingdom. However, unlike his peers, Yandi had a penchant for excitement, thus he often shirked his duties and ventured into the human world to experience all kinds of emotions of humankind, and today was just one of his many rambles in the mortal realm. While he appeared to be casually observing the bustling crowd, his gaze flickered toward a particular direction from time to time.

        ‘Heh, there she is again. I wonder what trick she’ll pull this time to get close to me,’ A sly smile tugged at the corners of Yandi’s lips as he raised his fan to cover his mouth. A gleam of anticipation in his eyes betrayed his eagerness to see what surprise awaited him.

        As he expected, a lithe figure flitted past him a few seconds later. Suddenly, she faltered and her body tilted toward him. Normally, it would be a scene taken straight out of a classic tale about the romantic encounter between a young man and a beauty: the beauty fell into the man’s arms because of a moment of weakness and began her destined love story.

        However, Yandi was no ordinary man; he was a man of great stature and wit who would never handle things so predictably. He swiftly reached into his robe, pulled out four daggers, and flung them toward the falling woman—

        Swish, swish!

        The daggers sliced through the air with a momentum that halted the woman’s fall, pinning the hem of her robes and her sleeves precisely onto a wall nearby. While the unorthodox rescue spared her the embarrassment of falling to the ground, she was stuck in a rather undignified position, a sight that made passersby pause and cover their mouths to muffle their laughter.

        “Oh my, isn’t this Jiutian Xuannü? What a coincidence. Here we meet again.” Yan Di greeted the woman—Jiutian Xuannü, one of the senior Xians in the Heavenly Kingdom—with an exaggerated look of surprise; he had absolutely no remorse for his actions.

        “Y-yes… What a coincidence indeed,” Jiutian Xuannü stammered, her face flushing scarlet with a mix of embarrassment and anger. As much as she wanted to let her temper flare, she swallowed the humiliation and twisted her body to free her clothes from the daggers. She wobbly stepped onto the ground and said, “I must have been so exhausted from exorcising the monsters earlier. Thank you for saving me from the fall, Yandi.”

        “Easy-peasy,” Yandi shamelessly accepted her reluctant words of gratitude as though they were the highest of praises. Then, he added, “But didn’t you just sprain your ankle two days ago? How is it that you’re already out exorcising monsters?”

        “W-well… Th-thanks to you, of course!” Jiutian Xuannü said. A twisted smile appeared on her face as she scrambled for an explanation, “I would have been in pain still if it wasn’t for your impeccable bone-setting technique, so it’s all thanks to you, ha… ha…” 

        ‘I can’t believe she actually told such a blatant lie,’ Yandi thought to himself. ‘I could tell she wasn’t injured at all that day with just one glance, so I deliberately pressed on her pain points, hoping she would learn and give up. Who would have thought that it would only harden her determination?’

        While Yandi inwardly grumbled, a flicker of mischievous light danced in his eyes as an idea came to his mind, ‘Fascinating. I’d like to see just how long she can keep this up.’

        “Yandi, I’m deeply grateful for your help for the past few days,” Jiutian Xuannü said. Her expression quickly shifted into a demure facade as she continued with feigned shyness, “Would you like to join me for lunch? I’d love to buy you a meal as a token of my gratitude.” 

        Yandi, however, remained utterly unmoved by her performance; quite the opposite, he began to scheme his next prank.

        “Of course. I just happen to know of a restaurant that serves extraordinary food,” Yandi replied,  his lips curling into a grin that carried the faintest hint of mischief.

        “Let’s go there then.” Jiutian Xuannü, unaware of the mischievous plan brewing, followed Yandi without the slightest suspicion. It wasn’t until she was seated at the table in the private dining room and saw the fiery red hotpot placed before her that she realized something was amiss. 

        “...I didn’t know you’re fond of spice, Yandi,” she remarked.

        “This restaurant is renowned for its authentic spicy hotpot, and they’re more than happy to adjust the spice level to suit their guests’ preferences,” Yandi said with a snap of his fingers. 

        Two waiters quickly entered the room at his command, each carrying a platter full of red chili peppers. They tipped all the chili peppers into the pot at Yandi’s subtle nod. In the blink of an eye, the rich aroma of spice filled the room, the air so pungent that Jiutian Xuannü could not help but cough twice.

        “Here, give it a try.” Yandi smiled as he handed a pair of chopsticks to Jiutian Xuannü, his tone and gesture leaving no room for rejection.

        “You can’t back down now, Jiutian Xuannü!” she steeled herself, inwardly roaring with determination. “Even that old hag He Xian’gu managed to snag Chiyou, one of the Three Divine Xians, as her husband, so you can snatch one too! I will win Yandi’s heart. Just you wait!”

        With that resolute thought, she threw all her hesitations to the wind and dove into the unbelievably spicy hotpot. By the time she finished the last bite and drained the final drop of fiery broth, she felt as though her very soul had been numbed by the spice. She slumped onto the table, her breathing shallow and her face ashen as the burning sensation lingered in her mouth. She looked so pitiful that it somehow aroused the last trace of Yandi’s conscience.

        “Let me go fetch a bowl of sour plum soup to help you cool the spice,” Yandi said. He then rose to his feet and left the room to find a waiter.

        Moments later, the sound of footsteps came into the room and someone placed a bowl of soup in front of Jiutian Xuannü.

        “Oh… You’re back with the soup, thanks.” Without any hesitation, she took the bowl and tilted her head back to drink the soup. However, she noticed something was not right when the liquid touched her lips. Before she could lower the bowl, a strong hand seized her wrist from behind and forcefully poured the rest of the liquid into her mouth. She tried to break free from the grip but to no avail. Her vision began to blur as a sense of numbness crept over her mind. It did not take long for her to lose consciousness entirely to the drugged soup. 

        A few seconds after her limp body was hoisted over a shoulder and carried out of the restaurant, Yandi returned with a bowl of sour plum soup in his hands.

        “Here’s the sour plum soup. I even asked the kitchen to make it extra tangy… Huh? Where did she go?” For once, his usual nonchalant demeanor was replaced by genuine surprise as he looked around the now-empty dining room. His face darkened and his gaze became sharp when he found the shattered ceramic bowl on the floor.

        “This smell… It’s the smell of the hypnotic drug…” Yandi muttered, his tone grim. “Tut! Those damned crooks from the Nether Pavilion… How dare they kidnap a Xian right under my nose? It seems I have been terribly underestimated.” Enraged, he slammed the bowl of sour plum soup onto the table. With a turn of his wrist, the paper fan in his hand transformed into a dust whisk. Meanwhile, his other hand moved rapidly, forming a series of intricate seals. In just a few seconds, a shimmering thread of golden light materialized in the air, extending out of the room.

        “I’ll make sure to teach those scum a proper lesson for preying on innocents this time!” Yandi declared. His figure turned into a streak of light as he followed the thread. It was not long before he caught up with the kidnapper and arrived at a remote forest on the outskirts of the town, only to be left utterly dumbfounded by the scene before him.

        “You FILTHY, STUPID PERVERT! How dare you drug me? I’ll beat you until your face looks like a pig’s head!”

        To his surprise, Jiutian Xuannü—whom he had assumed had already fallen victim to the foul cultivators—was very much awake, furiously pummeling the kidnapper, a male evil cultivator, punch after punch without showing any mercy. The cultivator, on the other hand, could only scramble to shield his head. Yandi, who had fully expected a damsel-in-distress scenario, found himself at a loss. However, his love for good drama quickly overcame him. He pulled a handful of melon seeds from his robe and began shelling and snacking on them as he settled in to watch the chaos unfold.

        “You— AH! I— AH! Stop— AH! I— AH! Said— AH! STOP— AH!”  The evil cultivator struggled to call for a truce, but he could not even get a full sentence out between the barrage of blows. In a fit of desperation, he pulled out an object from his robe and hurled it to the ground.

        BOOM! A grotesque monster materialized out of thin air and snatched Jiutian Xuannü with one of its massive claws. However, she was still weakened by the effects of the hypnotic drug; all the punches she gave the evil cultivator was just a brave act. With what little strength she had mustered earlier now completely spent, she had ways to break free from the monster’s crushing grip.

        ‘Am I going to die like this, without ever experiencing what it’s like to fall in love? Dang it…’ Jiutian Xuannü thought bitterly. A tear of regret fell from a corner of her closed eyes. Suddenly, a dull noise rang beside her ears. Before she could process what had happened,  the grip around her body vanished, and she fell straight into a pair of warm and steady arms.

        A hand gently brushed the tear from the corner of her eye. She slowly opened her eyes, only to see Yandi’s handsome face. In his right hand was a sword, its blade glistening with the viscous fluid of the monster that spattered over it when he severed the monster’s claw.

        “Stop crying. I’m here now,” Yandi comforted Jiutian Xuannü. His rarely gentle tone somehow tugged at her heartstrings and threw her into a sudden state of confusion, leaving her momentarily at a loss for words.

        Yandi, who thought Jiutian Xuannü was frightened, said no words. He lowered his gaze to the wild monster below, his smile replaced by a sharp and resolute expression as he said, “You have stolen the souls of many creatures to forge a wicked monster, a dreadful, crime against the laws of the Heavenly Kingdom. I, Yandi, as one of the three Divine Xians, shall punish you and your creation here as a warning to other foul cultivators!”

        Yandi then channeled his powers onto his sword, conjuring a sword of flames, his formidable weapon revered by many.

        “Purify and die!”

        At his command, the flames descended from the heavens and engulfed the monster and the evil cultivator. It was after all was settled that Yandi landed on the ground with Jiutian Xuannü in his arms.

        “Thank you for saving me, Yandi…” Jiutian Xuannü’ words of gratitude were cut short as she fell unconscious due to her injuries. Fortunately, Yandi caught her. Shaking his head, he said with a resigned smile, “Alas, what a reckless girl.”

        Afterward, Yandi carried Jiutian Xuannü back to the town. He healed her injuries with his powers and left her in an inn.

        The next day, Jiutian Xuannü awoke in the dappled sunlight. She felt refreshed after a night of peaceful slumber. She looked for Yandi only to find a note left on the table which informed her of his departure. Strangely, a sense of loss crept into her heart after she read it, and she somehow began to miss him.

        ‘So… Am I truly falling for Yandi?’ Jiutian Xuannü pondered. However, her melancholy moment was soon interrupted by a rumble from her stomach, forcing her to face reality. She then left her room and planned to have breakfast at the inn’s restaurant. Unexpectedly, the waiters turned their faces away and burst into laughter the moment they caught sight of her while the innkeeper cast a rather complicated glance at her. She quickly took out a hand mirror and looked at her reflection—

        There in the mirror she saw her forehead marred by the drawing of a pheasant and three words on her cheeks: This is me.

        Crack! The mirror shattered in her grip. The tender look in her eyes turned to one of resentment. The sprout of affection and romantic emotions in her heart transformed into a wave of rage and hatred as she shouted,

        “Yandi, you bastard! I will never fall for you again!”</p>
