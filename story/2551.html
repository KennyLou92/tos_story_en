        <h1>Indigo Feathers - Scrubia</h1>
        <p>        After saying goodbye to Idun, Scrubia and Beowulf went on their journey again. They covered every corner of Tarones, but they still couldn’t find the cure to her nightmare. Yet, they kept on searching instead of giving up.

        One day, they went into the woods after hearing about a relic of a primordial dragon there. By the time they arrived, it was already sundown so they stopped at a village nearby for the night.

        As Scrubia lay on the bed, she soon fell asleep, sliding into a bizarre dream that she had experienced many times——

        In the woods, there were a bunch of children playing hide and seek. As much as Scrubia wanted to join them, she stopped for her fear of her powers getting out of control again and hurting them. Suddenly, the woods grew. As the plants grew taller, they even obscured the figures of the children. Lifting her arm, Scrubia wanted to stop it, yet she slowly put her arm down.

        When her suitors walked towards her, she cowered in fright of getting hurt again. The woods then spurted and pushed all the suitors away. Left alone in the dense forest, she buried her head between her knees to get use to that loneliness. Yet, someone approached her with a warm glow… It was Beowulf who extended a hand to her.

        ‘You’ve found me…’ All along, Beowulf was the one who could break the fence around her heart, allowing her to put down her disguise.

        Just when she wanted to reach out her hand, she felt a searing pulsation in her chest. The next moment, Beowulf melted into a pool of green muddy liquid before her. Seeping under her feet, the liquid dragged her down to a pond shrouded in green mist… Scrubia struggled desperately, trying to wake up from this familiar nightmare which had given her nothing but agonizing pain.

        Before her racing heartbeat could even slow down, another unbearably scorching heat rose from her chest. As Scrubia woke up from the dream, she became worried when she looked around the room only to find that familiar figure was nowhere to be found.

        “No, he won’t abandon me. Something must have happened!”

        Scrubia walked out of the hotel and headed to the woods under the guide of the dragon soul. The further she went, the more scorching the heat she felt in her chest.

        After a long while, she finally found Beowulf at a clear corner in the dense forest. Yet, she was then round-eyed with terror for the scene before her—Beowulf was kneeling in front of a strange woman while screaming in pain with his head in his hands.

        “Who is that woman? No, whoever she is, it’s unforgivable for her to hurt Beowulf!” Seeing that woman stretching her hand to Beowulf, Scrubia immediately conjured her powers and turned her hair into a pair of dragon wings to stop her!
 
        Astoundingly, a familiar weapon blocked her wings. Scrubia stepped back in shock with a deep wound on her wings. The one who stopped her was not that woman but Beowulf, whose eyes were shining with blue light…

        ‘Beowulf! Don’t you recognize me?’ Scrubia choked with sobs. Yet, it was also her impassioned call that slightly pulled Beowuld’s mind out of that chaotic memories.

        ‘Scrubia… I… Who am I… Arghhhhh——!’ Yet, it was only a fleeting second of sanity; Beowulf’s mind was soon crushed and torn nearly into pieces by the immense flow of information with tears of blood falling from his eyes.

        That terrifying picture petrified Scrubia that burning tears were brimming over her eyes. Clenching her hands, yet, she soon suppressed that fear which could not help her overcome the problem before her nor help Beowulf. 

        “You’ve saved me from those years of being forsaken and helpless. This time, let me be the one to save you.”</p>
