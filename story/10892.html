        <h1>Refulgent Amberfire - Ke Hun</h1>
        <p>        In the eastern lands of Tarones, where the ancient Runedragons once thrived, the vast mountain ranges stood tall and imposing, their grandeur untouched by time. However, most of the Runedragons had relocated to the planets in the dragon territories, leaving only a few to guard their old home.

        A crimson Runedragon soared gracefully through the skies, circling above the peaks before descending slowly. The moment his claws touched the ground, his form shifted, transforming into that of a young boy.

        “It seems you’ve recovered quite a bit, Ke Hun,” said Ji Ying, a female Runedragon who approached him with a warm smile.

        “Of course, how could I not after resting for so many years?” Ke Hun replied with a slight shrug. 

        “Still, you’re not fully healed. While you might feel fine now, there’s always the risk of a relapse. It’s best to have someone by your side in case of emergencies.” Ji Ying hesitated before asking, “Where’s your Souliade? Are you two still in a fight?”

        The Runedragons were born in pairs, each bound for life to their Souliade—a partner who would protect them and share an unbreakable bond.

        “He’s the one throwing a tantrum! I don’t even know why he’s always so angry,” Ke Hun grumbled, pursing his lips. “Well, I’m not going to be the one to go looking for him. I can take care of myself just fine.”

        “That won’t do. You’re still recovering, and venturing out alone isn’t wise.” Ji Ying continued after a thoughtful pause, “Perhaps you should go to He’s clan and choose a servant to take care of you.”

        Long ago, one of the Runedragons, Qing Gui, had helped Heshi, the ancestor of the He’s clan, survive in troubled times. To repay Qing Gui’s kindness, Heshi vowed that his descendants would serve the Runedragons for generations, allowing each Runedragon to choose a member of He’s clan as their servant, someone who shall dedicate their life to aiding their master.

        However, the Runedragons were powerful beings, rarely in need of assistance. Only a few had called upon He’s clan over the centuries.

        ‘A servant…’ Ke Hun thought, his mind drifting to irreplaceable moments and the unbreakable bond he had shared with his Souliade, Hua Jin. ‘No… No one can take Hua Jin’s place. I only need one to stand by my side forever—my Souliade, not anyone else.’

        Resolute in his decision, Ke Hun refused Ji Ying’s suggestion. Unable to convince him otherwise, Ji Ying could only breathe a resigned sigh and watched as he left to embark on an adventure alone.

        Ke Hun’s journey went smoothly at first. The long-forgotten thrill of exploration filled him with joy, and he gradually let his guard down. When he came across a human town under attack by some ferocious wild beasts, he did not hesitate to step in, forgetting for a moment that his old injuries had yet fully healed.

        Taking on his human form, he hovered high in the sky to survey the town below. With swift precision, he drew a magical circle in the air to summon a staff of finely carved ebony wood. His sharp eyes scanned the rampaging wild beasts as he channeled his magic, and the tip of his staff began to glow, releasing a brilliant light.

        “Be purged by the breath of the Runedragons!” Ke Hun declared coldly as a powerful surge of magic erupted from him, transforming into a blazing plume of flames that poured down on every wild beast. In the blink of an eye, all the beasts were reduced to ashes, their remnants quietly vanishing into the air.

        “Phew… It’s been so long since I’ve used this much magic. I’m exhausted—” Ke Hun’s words halted as a searing pain tore through his body. His eyes widened in shock as he plummeted from the sky due to the sudden loss of strength. Fortunately, he landed in a soft patch of grass which spared him from serious injury.

        Still, he was far from safe.

        It turned out that the leader of the wild beasts had been observing the battle from the shadows. Seizing the vulnerable moment of its formidable opponent, it revealed itself to strike.

        Ke Hun tried to move, to fight back, but the pain rendered him powerless. He could only lie on the ground, struggling to breathe as he helplessly watched the beast close in.

        ‘Damn it… Why now…’ He gritted his teeth. His vision blurred, and his consciousness began to fade. Just as he braced himself for the end, a familiar figure—a dragon—appeared before him and shielded him from the beast’s attack, slaying it with a ferocious strike.

        Ke Hun tried to call out the dragon’s name—a name that had been echoing in his mind for days. But his voice failed him. His eyelids grew heavier as his strength continued to ebb away. In his hazy vision, he saw the dragon shift into the form of a tall, sturdy man. He walked toward him, knelt down, and gently cradled him in his arms, as though holding the most fragile and precious treasure in the world.

        “Hua… Jin…” Ke Hun finally managed to say the man’s name, his voice trembling with longing and relief, before succumbing to unconsciousness.

        It was after what seemed like an eternity that Ke Hun finally awoke, his body weak but stable. After some effort, he managed to sit up, realizing he was inside a small inn.

        On the table beside him was a cup of freshly brewed tea and a plate of his favorite snacks. Yet, the man who had prepared them was nowhere to be found.

        “...That idiot… Hua Jin, you big idiot!” Ke Hun muttered angrily. The angry frustration tempted him to knock the table over, but he held back, grabbing the tea and snacks instead.

        A sense of peace settled over him as he ate—a quiet reassurance knowing that his Souliade had never stopped protecting him even during their fight.

        From then on, Ke Hun continued his journey in solitude, but with greater caution. Eventually, through a twist of fate, he joined the Starmage and dedicated himself to the study of magic…

        “Each Runedragon is bound to their Souliade for life. It is an eternal connection that can never be replaced. The same holds true for me.”</p>
