        <h1>Skuld, Blood-stained Vower</h1>
        <p>
                Inside the Enochian Tower, Skuld sedated Odin, who had gone out of control again. After using up all her powers, she leaned against the wall to take some rest. As though to relieve her weariness, the elements created a realistic illusion, showing her an alternative reality of the other choice she could have made…

        When the Seal was triggered and Odin set foot in the path of no return, Skuld’s scissors went forward; its cold blade touched his neck. ‘Shall I kill you?’ she asked.

        The violet light of the Seal veiled Skuld’s face, but Odin could still hear her voice, in the same tone as usual. Little did he know that Skuld was trying her best to conceal the rising tide in her heart from him.

         Now that the Seal was complete, Odin could ask Skuld to cut the thread of his life if he did not want to spend the rest of his days in infinite torment.

        Skuld recalled all the sacrifices Odin had made for the people over the past years. At that moment, she ached to give him the eternal peace he deserved. However…

        ‘No. I shall live forever in the Seal as a warning to others,’ said Odin.

        ‘You do not have to do this. Do you know what lies ahead of you?’

        ‘I do. As Mimir and you have mentioned…’
　
        Skuld had been watching the fate of others and she never interfered. Yet, she lost her usual composure when it came to Odin—she could not bear to watch this man who had devoted himself completely to the North live in endless suffering. A question kept churning in her mind, “Is he destined for such a tragic life?”

        “A hero deserves to die well.” At such a thought, Skuld defied her father, Mimir’s teaching. She channeled her godly power and thrust her scissors into Odin’s body, cutting the thread of his life.

        ‘Skuld, you——’ Disappointment and sorrow flickered across Odin’s face, and his body that had been riddled with scars stopped breathing before he could finish the sentence.

        The long-lost peace was restored in the North after the Dragon of Poison had been sealed. Nonetheless, there were still demon intrusions from time to time. In such times, Skuld would put on her armor and hunt down the remnant troopers of demons.

        On the ice field, Skuld swung her giant scissors to dispel the arrows and swords of the demons. Conjuring her godly power, she stamped her foot on the ice, sending lines of flames from the tip of her toe.

        As the scorchingly high temperature broke the ice into pieces, the demons around fell into the water instantly. No one survived—even those who were able to squirm back to the surface of the ice floe could not escape the blade of Skuld.

        Just when Skuld flung off the blood on her scissors, she heard a nerve-racking howl from afar, followed by a colossal dragon shadow flying across the sky. The Dragon of Poison that the North had sealed at the cost of numerous lives was unexpectedly released back into the world…

        The remnants of the demon army secretly broke the Seal of the Dragon of Poison, making it the ultimate weapon to destroy the North. The Dragon of Poison once again brought the realm of humans to its end, with its rotten body and corrosive breath putting the unknowing people of the North to death.

        Only then did Skuld realize that Odin's decision was right—the Dragon of Poison needed to be guarded. Hence, she made up her mind in an instant.

        Skuld called upon all the heroes of the North to stand against the Dragon of Poison again. It was just that years of tranquility had worn their fighting spirit.

        “Since I am the one who cut Odin's thread of life, I shall bear the consequences. Even if it costs everything, I ought to make amends in my own way.”

        Raising her giant scissors, Skuld took the lead to charge at the dragon. Even though her hands were corroded by venom and her scissors cracked, she still stood at the forefront so as to boost morale.

        Under her desperate efforts, they finally sealed the Dragon of Poison back in the magic circle. Just when everyone breathed a sigh of relief, they saw Skuld walking into the Seal alone without a backward glance.

        ‘Skuld! What are you doing?!’ Verthandi exclaimed.

        ‘I shall be bound to the Tower to guard the Dragon of Poison,’ said Skuld, who looked back with determination and resolution.

        ‘You do not have to do this!’ shouted Urd.

        It was the same old conversation in the same situation, just with different people. History always repeats itself.

        Skuld slowly shook her head and replied, ‘This is what it meant to be. Now I am just leading everything back to the right track of fate.’

        And so, everyone in the North could only watch as Skuld gradually disappeared into the Seal…

        “Heroes deserve a glorious end, and I will gladly do them the favor even if it means devoting the rest of my life.”</p>
