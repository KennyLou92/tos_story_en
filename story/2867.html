        <h1>Fatherly Ascendance - Cao Guojiu</h1>
        <p>        Since Cao Guojiu’s unrequited love for Xiao Zi came to an end, he decided to find a new relationship to heal his broken heart. In order to forget the sorrowful experience, Cao Guojiu actively participated in various speed-dating dinners, hoping to escape his single status as quickly as possible. At this moment, he was carefully examining the portraits of the female Xians who would be attending tonight’s banquet.

        “Hmm… This Xian has a good temperament... And this one has a slender figure—”

        “In my opinion, a woman’s temperament is the most important when it comes to choosing a wife,” a childish voice suddenly sounded behind Cao Guojiu. Startled, he turned around abruptly to find a cute little boy standing there.

        “Who are you? How dare you trespass into my house!”

        “I’m your son, Xiao Suo,” the little boy said confidently. “And I didn’t trespass into your home. I live here.”

        “Humph, you’re quite good at acting, you little demon! Tell me the truth or don’t blame me for forcing you to!” Cao Guojiu said, reaching out to grab Xiao Suo, but the boy evaded him skillfully.

        “Sigh, I can’t believe that Daddy has actually forgotten about me. However, as your child, I should give you a hint. Take a look at this,” said Xiao Suo resignedly. As he waved his finger, a pair of golden handcuffs fell into his hand. A deeply unpleasant memory flooded back to Cao Guojiu when he saw the handcuffs.

        A few days earlier, Han Xiangzi had used that very handcuffs to shackle Cao Guojiu and Zhongli Quan together. It was after a fierce battle that the two Xians finally managed to subdue Han Xiangzi and force him to remove the handcuffs.

        Cao Guojiu had absentmindedly taken the handcuffs home, but later, he had completely forgotten about it due to his heartbreak. Now seeing Xiao Suo holding the handcuffs and calling him “Daddy”, Cao Guojiu could not help but have a wild guess—

        “You are… the spirit of that pair of handcuffs!” Cao Guojiu blurted out in realization. 

        “You got it right, Daddy! But…why are you holding a rope, Daddy?”

        “Let’s take you to the Treasure Pagoda,” Cao Guojiu said coldly.

        “But I don’t want to!” Xiao Suo pouted as he stomped his feet in displeasure.

        “That’s not up to you.”

        “Well… You left me no choice.  It hurts me to turn Daddy into a baldy, especially when Daddy is going to a speed dating dinner later. But since Daddy is so stubborn, I guess I can just do it against my will,” Xiao Suo sighed, yet there was a mischievous gleam in his eyes—he was clearly plotting against Cao Guojiu.

        “You!” It was only then that Cao Guojiu recalled that the handcuffs carried a curse capable of turning people bald. The unpleasant memories made him break into a cold sweat.

        “I don’t have time to deal with him right now since I still have to attend the banquet. Let me take care of him another day!” Cao Guojiu thought to himself.

        “...Ahem. Fine, you don’t have to go to the Treasure Pagoda, but you have to stay here and cause no trouble!”

        “Of course, I’ll be a good boy, Daddy.” said Xiao Suo, widening his innocent, round eyes and acting all cute.

        “Stop it! I’m not your daddy!” Cao Guojiu shouted, then changed into his formal attire for the banquet. After dressing himself handsomely, he realized it was getting late and hurriedly made his way to the venue.

        Yet, a strange spectacle unfolded before Cao Guojiu when he arrived at the venue. All the female Xians, disregarding the other male Xians present, were enthusiastically surrounding a young boy, engrossed in lively conversation

        “That’s…the spirit of the handcuffs! I told him to stay at home, yet he had the audacity to sneak out and follow me… I must teach him a lesson!” Cao Guojiu rolled up his sleeves, ready to reprimand Xiao Suo. But before he could take more than a couple of steps, the female Xians noticed him and walked over with their faces filled with admiration.

        “Cao, I didn’t know you’re a man with such a generous heart!”

        “There have been rumors that Cao Guojiu is cold-hearted, but now we know that it’s not true after all.”

        “Uh… What are you all talking about?” Cao Guojiu asked nervously, taken aback by the enthusiastic female Xians.

        “Don’t be modest. Xiao Suo told us everything. He told us that you saved him from an evil cultivator and adopted him as your son to guide him toward the right path,” one of the female Xians replied.

        “Huh?” Cao Guojiu was momentarily stunned. Seeing his reaction, the female Xians sensed something was amiss and looked puzzled. Cao Guojiu quickly regained his composure. He pulled Xiao Suo into his arms and held him affectionately, acting just like a loving father.

        “Haha, y-yes. As a Xian, guiding all beings toward benevolence is only natural,” Cao Guojiu said somewhat awkwardly, but Xiao Suo played along with his lies perfectly. Flashing an innocent and radiant smile, he put his arms around Cao Guojiu’s neck and sweetly said, “Daddy, you’re the best!”

        With Xiao Suo’s perfect acting, Cao Guojiu successfully portrayed himself as a kind Xian who was husband material, replacing his previous reputation for being unruly. He even garnered the favor of several female Xians.

        The successful experience put Cao Guojiu in such a great mood that he even abandoned the idea of sending Xiao Suo to the Treasure Pagoda and decided to live with the little boy.

        Cao Guojiu, who had been living alone all this time, thought he would have difficulty adjusting to living with someone else. However, his time spent with Xiao Suo shattered that assumption.

        Xiao Suo, who had a keen sense of understanding Cao Guojiu’s words and expressions, always appeared at the most appropriate times—treating Cao Guojiu’s injuries after he had been wounded by evil demons, offering hot tea when he was tired, comforting him with gentle words when he felt lonely, and greeting him with a simple and bright smile in the morning. Gradually, Cao Guojiu grew accustomed to Xiao Suo’s presence and even began to enjoy the warm companionship.

        However, such heartwarming days suddenly stopped one day. As usual, Cao Guojiu woke up in the morning only to find that Xiao Suo, who always waited by his bedside, was nowhere to be found.

        “Haha, that boy must have overslept. Let me go tease him a little bit,” Cao Guojiu thought with a light-hearted mood. He entered Xiao Suo’s room but the sight before him terrified him—Xiao Suo was lying on the ground, barely breathing, and his body was fading away.

        “Xiao Suo!” Cao Guojiu rushed forward, drawing Xiao Suo into his arms. Worried, he gently shook the boy to wake him. In response, Xiao Suo weakly lifted his heavy eyelids. Tears streamed down his delicate little face as he saw Cao Guojiu, evoking a sense of pity within Cao Guojiu’s heart, who regarded himself as Xiao Suo’s father.

        “I… My body hurts so badly… Am I…about to disappear?” Xiao Suo feebly murmured.

        “No! I won’t let you disappear!” Cao Guojiu said with anguish while lightly patting Xiao Suo’s back.  Xiao Suo buried his head in Cao Guojiu’s arms, sobbing as he said, “I’m scared... Daddy…”

        “It’s okay! Daddy will protect you!” Cao Guojiu said with determination. Tightening his embrace, he hurriedly made his way to the residence of Taishang Laojun.

        After examining Xiao Suo, Taishang Laojun addressed the anxious Cao Guojiu, “This spirit was born from the fusion of two Xian energies. However, one of the energies is nearly depleted. He may completely vanish if it’s not replenished as soon as possible.”

        Two Xian energies... Earlier, Han Xiangzi used Xiao Suo to bind me and Zhongli Quan, and shortly after, Xiao Suo appeared... Could the other Xian energy be…” 

        A figure gradually surfaced in Cao Guojiu’s mind.

        “Zhongli Quan!”

        And so, Cao Guojiu swiftly carried the unconscious boy and rushed toward Zhongli Quan’s residence...</p>
