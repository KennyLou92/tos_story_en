        <h1>Hazardous Experiment - Galois</h1>
        <p>        [b][i]After days of stagnation, my research on reactive metal has finally reached a breakthrough. Ahaha! I am indeed the most brilliant genius! I’m the only one who has discovered the potential activation of certain elements within the metal which requires a spiral structure…

        (A detailed technical analysis of around ten thousand words is omitted...)

        In essence, I must now embark on a quest to collect samples of life’s structures from around the universe so as to find the ideal reactive metal sequence. Ahaha! I’m thrilled!

        Lead Researcher of the Reactive Metal Project (under the Battle Cruiser Project)
        Évariste Galois[/i][/b]

        On a remote and desolate planet, far from any inhabited regions, not a blade of grass could be seen in the scorched landscape, where the extremely searing heat turned the terrain into an endless expanse of rock and sand.

        Yet, amidst such a harsh environment, some lives persisted. A dozen colossal, camel-like creatures with horns gathered near a rocky outcrop. Using their metallic and sturdy horns, they dug into the solid ground to unearth wiry worms hidden within the rocky sand, devouring them to survive.

        It was a common occurrence on this desolate planet, explaining the basic mechanism of natural selection, something unnoticed by most of the creatures in the universe. However, two individuals hid behind a large rock, closely observing the movements of these horned creatures.

        “Laura, look, look! Those are the horned camels!” exclaimed the young man with a ponytail, excitedly shifting up and down, his gaze fixed on the creatures. Pointing at them, he turned to the woman beside him, saying passionately, “Their horns are made of metal, just as I expected! Their horns are sharp enough to slice through the rocks on this planet! Their life structure is undoubtedly a useful reference for our research!”

        “You’re right, Professor Galois,” Laura, the female machina, respectfully replied.

        “Oh, Laura, Laura, there’s no need to call me Professor. It feels kind of weird when you call me like that,” Galois squirmed and fidgeted, feeling itchy as he heard Laura.

        “No. Professor is Professor,” Laura insisted, displaying a rare determination.

        As immature as Galois’ demeanor might seem, he was undeniably a gold scientist of the Lomond Manor, a genius with extraordinary experiences. It was Galois who had picked her from the underachievers and brought her into the Reactive Metal Project. For such reasons, Laura held great gratitude and admiration for Galois, considering his words and actions to be her guiding principles.

        “...Sigh. Fine, suit yourself,” Galois let out a long sigh, giving up on correcting Laura.  He redirected his attention back to the horned camels, raising his chin in contemplation. “While finding the camels is a good start, how do we obtain a sample of their life structure?”

        “Let me do it,” Laura unsheathed a weapon from her waist, her graceful face now displaying a killing intent. “Killing one shouldn’t be difficult.”

        “No, no, no!” Galois pressed down on Laura’s hand that held the weapon, his face pale with alarm as he shouted, “We can’t just kill them as we wish, even if they lack sentience!”

        “But then we can’t obtain a sample…”

        “Well… We haven’t exhausted all our options yet. Anyhow, killing is definitely out of the question!” Galois scratched his head in frustration, then suddenly looked up with a jolt. “Oh, I’ve got it! I can use that prototype!”

        “The prototype?”

        “Yes, I invented a disguise device during my spare time. It can create a virtual camouflage based on the target’s images, using magic, of course.”

        “...So, you plan to disguise yourself as a horned camel?” Laura struggled to keep up with Galois’ train of thought, which was understandable considering that no one else would have the idea to disguise themselves as a creature from a desolate planet.

        “Exactly. The horned camels possess a strong collective consciousness. They are extremely friendly toward their kind and never engage in a fight. So, they won’t attack as long as I can blend in with them!” Galois wiped his nose with his finger, proudly stating, “What a genius I am!”

        “Then let me do it.”

        “No! How can I let a young girl take the risk?” Galois raised his hand to stop Laura, refusing any objections. “Besides, the disguise device is still a work in progress. It can only create an illusion for ten minutes. So, I’ll need your combat prowess to rescue me if anything goes wrong.”

        “Umm…”

        “Alright, we made the decision!” Galois took out the disguise device and began capturing the image of the horned camels. After a brief moment, as soon as he finished the preparations, he eagerly infused the device with magic. Then, in a burst of dazzling light, he transformed into a fine horned camel.

        “Haha! It actually worked!” An  exuberant expression spread across Galois’ face as if he was not off to collect a sample but to play in an amusement park. He kicked up his hind legs to gesture toward Laura, “Here I go!”

        Galois darted toward the group of horned camels like a flying arrow. Soon, he made contact with one of them. The camel eyed him with a hint of caution. Another horned camel then followed it, and soon the scattered camels converged, encircling Galois.

        Laura, watching nervously from the side, placed her hand on her weapon, ready to intervene if necessary.

        Finally, a noticeably robust leader camel among the flock lifted its hoof, raised its head, and emitted a piercing neigh before lunging toward Galois.

        Suppressing the urge to dodge, Galois stood firm in his place, and he won the gamble—the leader did not attack him. Instead, it affectionately rubbed its face against Galois’. It appeared to be a welcoming ritual to indicate its acceptance to the other horned camels.

        Then, the camels dispersed and continued with their previous activities. Galois let out a sigh of relief, while Laura resheathed her weapon.

        Afterward, taking advantage of the leader’s lowered guard, Galois carefully ground off a portion of its horns and quickly distanced himself from the flock, narrowly completing the mission before the disguise disappeared.

        With the life structures of various species in hand, Galois had a breakthrough in the research of reactive metals, and final application tests commenced.

        As the project’s lead researcher, Galois was naturally occupied with a flurry of activity, and Laura was not faring much better. Every day before dawn even broke, she would arrive at the laboratory to observe the magical furnace, and she would not leave until the night fell. Despite the heavy workload, she had no complaints, actively dedicating herself to the experiments until she had a conversation with a certain researcher one day.

        “Laura, what are your plans after the Reactive Metal Project?”

        “Huh?” Laura looked up, puzzled, as she adjusted the magic furnace’s energy. She did not quite understand the question. “That would depend on Professor Galois’ arrangement, wouldn’t it?”

        “That’s not how things work. Galois is a gold scientist of the Lomond Manor, remember? With the successful completion of the Battle Cruiser Project, he will surely get further promotion. How could he possibly continue with a novice like you? It’s time for you to think about your future,” the researcher explained before being called away by another colleague, leaving Laura in a daze.

        ‘He’s right. I’m only allowed to work with Professor Galois because of this project. Of course, we’ll have to go our separate ways once it’s over…’ Laura tried to convince herself, but such a thought distressed her, as agonizing as if someone was clutching her kinetic core.

        Perhaps influenced by the inexplicable melancholy or driven by some subconscious desire, Laura, who was usually cautious and meticulous, made a mistake. She accidentally infused too much magic into the magic furnace, pushing it beyond its limits. When the shrill alarm sounded, it was already too late to prevent the imminent explosion.

        All the researchers present fled for their lives, except for one figure who ran in the opposite direction, straight toward the site of the accident.

        Laura recognized that figure at a glance and shouted anxiously, “Professor Galois!”

        Laura’s call failed to stop Galois, who continued rushing forward, leaving Laura no choice but to catch up. However, with the throng of researchers in the corridor, she could only hear a thunderous explosion that was accompanied by a brute shockwave —which almost knocked her over—when she finally made it to the scene.

        After struggling to regain her balance, Laura tried to move forward only to see a figure engulfed in flames leap out of the laboratory—the burning figure of Galois!

        “Galois!” Laura cried out in pain and despair. She would rather have the fire burn her body than see Galois, a fragile human, engulfed in flames. However, what happened, happened. The only thing she could do was to hurriedly extinguish the flames on Galois. Still, his arms had already been severely burnt and charred by then.

        “Oh… Laura, it’s you… Thanks…” Despite the excruciating pain, Galois wore his usual boisterous expression without showing any signs of despair. However, the beads of cold sweat on his head revealed his frail state.

        “...It’s all my fault! It’s my incompetence that caused the experiment to fail and hurt you!”

        “No… The experiment didn’t fail…” Galois raised his hands, showing her the piece of reactive metal prototype in his palm. “I managed to retrieve it just in time. As long as we have it, our experiment is a success. So, Laura, don’t go too harsh on yourself.”

        “Professor…”

        “But I’m feeling a bit tired now. You might have to carry me out of here.”

        “I will get you out of here!”

        “Laura, you truly... are reliable...” Galois, with his mortal body, finally fell into a deep sleep.

        Later, Laura carried Galois out of the laboratory and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. However, his arms were too seriously burned, and amputation was the only option. His lost limbs were then replaced by a pair of prosthetic arms.

        Galois, far from being disheartened, was excited to try out his brand-new bionic arms. He even expressed regret for not having them sooner.

        Nevertheless, despite Galois’ resilience, Laura was still consistently haunted by guilt, believing that she was not cut out to be a researcher. Later, she decided to resign and joined the Oroz Management Center as a special agent...</p>
