        <h1>Dagon, Father of the Deep Ones</h1>
        <p>        The legend had it that the Elder GodDagon could grant their believers peace, bring them away from the fires of war, and lead them to an azure silence.

        According to records, the Elder Gods left their bodies in the realm of men after creating the world while their spirits flew into an ethereal space.  People learned about their existence from the literature written by ancient humans. Believers of Elder Gods summoned Ethereal Dragons, the incarnations of the Gods, which wandered in the realm of Men with godly powers...

        ‘...We trembled with fear as we thought it would descend with great power and bring earth-shattering changes.  But the Elder Godonly consumes the offerings and did not bestow blessings upon us.  When the shocks finally stopped after the ritual’s end, the Elder Godhad already disappeared. We could only barely see its claws and scales through the cave.  That was when people cheered in front of the big cave in the cliff face. As  I approached to touch the fluid it left on the wall of the cave, I could feel a chilling cold run through my body as glittering scales grew from my skin.  I immediately realized that it must be guidance from the Elder God.  It wants us to live in the seas as it does; this way, we can become residents there away from the wars and seek happiness within dark crevices or great depths of the ocean...

        Flipping to the next page, the mage found that it had been wet and the words on it had  blurred.  He used a short and simple spell to put the ink back together, but only meaningless words —  “stones”, “statues”and “miasma” — were formed.  The mage shook his head and threw the book back into the water, where it created ripples that pushed floating objects aside.  On this half-sunken shipwreck, he did not find any clues related to the Ethereal Dragon.  He only knew that heretics had stolen his magic circle to summon the incarnation of the Elder God, and hid in the darkness with its uncontrollable power.  To make amends for the heretics, the mage had been tracing their footsteps, but he could never find any hints to their whereabouts. 

        The mage gathered the the shreds of evidence left by the heretics, such as the carvings of a tentacled monster, totems of a half-fish-half-human creature, and books written with unrefined spells— these objects disgusted the mage so much that he released dark elements from the runestones to destroy them...</p>
