        <h1>Cryptic Incantation - Jia Baoyu</h1>
        <p>        In the demesne of the Fu Yuan demon clan’s Jia family—

        After going through the usual business routine, Lord Jia left his study and made his way toward the adjacent courtyard, which served as the residence of his eldest son, Jia Baoyu.

        “Baoyu is inside, right?” he asked the servant who was guarding Jia Baoyu’s study.

        “Sir, sir!” the servant shouted in a panic, startled by Lord Jia’s sudden appearance. Seeing the furrowed brows on his master’s face, the servant quickly composed himself, but still, his fluttering eyes revealed his disquiet.

        A crafty man like Lord Jia, of course, noticed the servant’s unease. He rushed forward and pushed open the door to the study, leaving no time for the servant to react. As expected, Jia Baoyu, who should have been practicing his art of talismans inside, was nowhere to be seen. Only a letter was left on the desk, which said, “Father, I have found an intriguing secret realm. I’ll return shortly, so don’t miss me too much. But if you do, feel free to roar for three seconds.”

        Lord Jia’s rage erupted with a hectic flush of anger creeping into his face as he read the defiant words left by Jia Baoyu. And as Jia Baoyu had suggested, he let out a thunderous roar that shook the roof, “Jia Baoyu! That insolent boy!”

❊

        “Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!”

        In a snowing secret realm, hundreds of miles away, stood a young man of exquisite beauty, his stature tall and graceful, his face as delicate as powdered jade. A couple of sudden sneezes marred his elegance. “Hmm… Why did I suddenly sneeze? Oh, it must be Father cursing me right now after finding that I have sneaked out. Sigh, he’ll probably scold me hard when I return.”

        The young man was named Jia Baoyu. After wiping his nose with his sleeve, his big round eyes shifted to the side, revealing a mischievous spark. “That’s why I must get the hidden treasure; otherwise, it wouldn’t be worth the scolding.”

        Jia Baoyu was a Fu Yuan demon. Different from other demons, the Fu Yuan demons had a unique flow of elemental energy within their bodies, which caused stagnation at the joints and resulted in stiff movements. Nevertheless, the biological inheritance bestowed upon Jia Baoyu immense power, allowing him to channel his energy into specially crafted talismans and cast various formidable spells.

        The Fu Yuan demon clan had produced numerous renowned masters of talisman art in the past. To preserve their profound knowledge after their deaths, the masters stored their treasures and techniques within boundaries they called the secret realms. The secret realms opened periodically, with multiple challenging traps and tests designed to select worthy individuals as the heirs to the legacy hidden within.

        With an inherent curiosity twice as strong as ordinary individuals, Jia Baoyu, of course, could not resist the allure of exploring these secret realms. And so, he was determined to seize the opportunity, even if it meant defying his father’s orders and risking his life.

        Jia Baoyu surveyed his surroundings. Behind him was an endless expanse of snow-covered plains, from which he had trekked for half a day to reach the sole snow-capped mountain in the vicinity. He gazed uphill in search of any clues but the mountain was entirely shrouded in a blizzard, concealing its features. 

        However, Jia Baoyu had already thoroughly explored every accessible area except this mountain. Therefore, he was convinced that the hidden treasure of the secret realm lay atop its summit. Yet, venturing inside without any leads was undoubtedly perilous, which was also the reason why many previous adventurers abandoned their attempts and returned empty-handed.

        “As a member of the prestigious Jia family, how could I be such a coward?” Jia Baoyu, as bold as a newborn calf, thought to himself. With his courage fueled by his exceptional talent in the arts of talisman and confidence in his extraordinary skill, he bravely ventured into the snowy mountain.

        However, sometimes even with great abilities, one cannot withstand the onslaught of a group — Jia Baoyu had only walked a short distance on his way up the mountain when he found himself surrounded by a pack of snow monsters twice his size. Due to his limited experience in walking on snow, he stumbled and fell. One of the snow monsters captured him, lifting him up to its mouth, ready to feast on his body.

        “Tut! I didn’t plan on using my talismans so soon, but now is not the time for pride!” Just as Jia Baoyu was about to use a talisman to counterattack, a talisman flew over from nearby and struck the snow monster that was holding him.

        The attack forced the snow monster to release its grip, and Jia Baoyu fell from the height, yet before he could steady himself, he heard a fine voice from above exclaim, “Run, now!”

        Jia Baoyu’s body moved faster than the unknown shout. He crawled and sprinted his way out of the snow monster’s encirclement, following the graceful figure that leaped through the trees. Together, they escaped from the snowy mountain and returned to the foot of the mountain.

        Whoosh!

        The figure gracefully leaped down from a tree and landed quietly. It was a girl who seemed to be around seventeen or eighteen years old. She possessed a sweet and beautiful countenance, her vibrant attire accentuating her youthful vitality. Dazzled by her beauty, Jia Baoyu took a moment to recover his senses before bowing with a fist-and-palm salute. He said, “Thank you for saving my life.”

        The girl who seemed to be unaccustomed to receiving words of gratitude turned her face away awkwardly and replied, “It was nothing. Even if I didn’t save you, you would have found a way to escape yourself.”

        “Even so, it doesn’t change the fact that you’ve helped me. It is only appropriate for me to express my gratitude,” Jia Baoyu smiled. “I assume you’re also here to seek the hidden treasure of the secret realm. May I inquire about what those snow monsters were?”

        “I only came here a while earlier. Those snow monsters should be the guardians of this secret realm. From my brief observation, they  seem to be scattered throughout the entire mountain, and they will relentlessly pursue any intruders.”

        “Oh, it seems this mountain is unattainable then,” Jia Baoyu sighed with regret. Despite his love for challenges, he was aware of the perilous odds that awaited him.

        “There might still be a way, but it requires your help.”

        “Really?!” Jia Baoyu's eyes lit up, and he quickly answered, “I will do everything in my power to help.”

        “By the way…” the girl paused and continued, “are you afraid of heights?”

        “...Huh?” The girl’s innocent gaze distracted Jia Baoyu and evoked a sense of endearment within him.  It took him a moment to regain his composure and process her question before he shook his head.

        The girl smiled and said, “That’s good to hear.”

        Jia Baoyu was still puzzled at the girl’s answer, but he soon understood why—

        Two phoenixes flew side by side in the vast expanse of the snowy realm’s sky, each carrying a young man and girl on their backs.

        “So your solution is to ride these phoenixes and fly to the top of the snow mountain. No wonder you asked if I was afraid of heights,” said Jia Baoyu, who grasped the feathers on the phoenix’s neck while overlooking the diminishing landscape. He then sighed, “I had considered flying to the mountain’s top with a phoenix before, but no matter what I tried, mine just didn’t fly. Now I know why—they need to fly in pairs.”

        “I once saw some phoenixes outside the secret realm before. The phoenixes are a species that mate for life. They do everything in pairs and no one can force them to abandon their strong bond. I had given up this idea but I changed my mind after meeting you,” the girl pursed her lips and spoke somewhat awkwardly, “They are truly some peculiar birds. Surprisingly, they haven’t gone extinct by now.”

        “Is that so? I find it quite romantic,” said Jia Baoyu while raising an eyebrow, his delicate face becoming more spirited and enchanting. Momentarily mesmerized by his charm, the girl hastily turned her face away and stammered, “W-well, agree to disagree.”

        Just as Jia Baoyu was going to continue the conversation, he caught sight of the snow monsters pacing back and forth below. With his expression turning serious, he spoke in a low voice, “We’re passing through the snow monsters’ territory. Be careful and don’t let them see us.”

        “We’re far above the ground. Even if they see us, they won’t be able to hurt us,” the girl said, boldly leaning out to observe the snow monsters below, disregarding Jia Baoyu’s warning. She even made a funny face at them.

        Strangely, the snow monsters seemed to sense the girl’s provocation. They suddenly raised their heads and stared at her.

        “Woah!” The girl shrank back in fright and said, “H-how did they know we’re here?”

        “The temperature… They must have detected the phoenixes’ heat!” Jia Baoyu had been observing the snow monsters. He knew something was amiss when he saw the snow monsters squat down after giving some intimidating growl at the sky in vain. He watched as they reached down and grabbed the snow with their hands—

        “Get down! They are trying to pelt us with snowballs and knock us off!” Jia Baoyu shouted.

        “What—ouch!” The girl’s exclamation was cut short as a massive snowball struck her, causing her to lose her balance and fall off the phoenix’s back.

        “No!” Jia Baoyu’s heart skipped a beat as he witnessed the fall. He immediately steered the phoenix to catch up with the falling girl. Luckily, he reached the ground first. Swiftly standing on the phoenix’s back, he opened his arms and raised them high.

        Boom!

        The falling girl landed in Jia Baoyu’s open arms. Gravity drew the two’s faces toward each other, so close that their breaths intertwined. Jia Baoyu’s heart controllably pounded as the girl’s intoxicating fragrance filled his nostrils. However, the roar of the approaching snow monsters reminded him that it was not the right time for romance. 

        Suppressing his emotions, Jia Baoyu chanted in a low voice, “Talisman of the earth and heaven, converge and ward off evil!”

        Several talismans shot out from his hands. Radiating blinding light, together they unleashed powerful blasts of wind, blowing the oncoming snow monsters away. Then, once again, he steered the phoenix and flew back into the sky to join the other phoenix in the air.

        This time, the girl remained vigilant throughout the way, carefully avoiding the snow monsters’ projectiles alongside Jia Baoyu. Finally, they successfully reached the summit of the snow mountain and landed in front of an elegant mansion.

        As they dismounted from the phoenixes, an awkward silence enveloped them due to the recent ordeal. Eventually, the girl broke the silence, saying, “L-let’s go inside and take a look.”

        “Sure, but there might be dangers inside. I’ll go in first,” said Jia Baoyu, who took the lead and stepped into the mansion. However, contrary to their expectations, it appeared quiet and safe inside the mansion. On a table in the grand hall, they found the hidden treasure—a palm-sized gem divided into four compartments.

        “Dear intrepid explorers, this gem is a precious treasure crafted throughout my lifetime, and I’ve named it the Four Seasons Pearl,” the girl read from the note beside the gem. “My wife, frail and plagued by illness, had been confined to the boundary of our house without experiencing the true wonders of the seasons. Thus, I encapsulated the most magnificent landscapes of each season within this pearl, allowing one to admire the beauty of nature with just a touch of magic power. Unfortunately, by the time I completed this masterpiece, my wife had breathed her last, unable to witness its marvels. Therefore, I left this pearl and this secret realm, hoping that a worthy individual would fulfill my final wish.”

        A tinge of disappointment clouded the girl’s sparkling eyes before she finished reading the note. She set the note aside and said dejectedly, “I came all the way here, hoping to acquire some useful hidden treasure, but instead, what I get is just a decorative prop for recreating seasonal scenery… How disappointing.”

        “Is that so? I find it rather intriguing,” Jia Baoyu remarked as he picked up the gem. Following the instructions in the note, he channeled his power into the gem. The gem burst forth in a dazzling light, causing the surrounding scenery to gradually dissolve like melting ice, only to quickly reassemble again.

        The elegant mansion in which Jia Baoyu and the girl stood vanished, and the serene snowy landscape dissipated like a fleeting dream. In its place stood a lush row of peach blossom trees, stretching from the top down to the foot of the mountain. The tranquil fragrance of blossoms permeated the canvas of a verdant green and pink. Bathed in the morning light, everything was adorned by a layer of golden radiance that resembled an idyllic haven.

        “It’s truly beautiful…” Moved by the picturesque sight, the girl could not help but exclaim in awe.

        “It isn’t that bad after all,” Jia Baoyu said with a smile, gazing at the girl, who blushed with embarrassment. She replied sheepishly, “Well… Ye-yeah.”

        “After that fight with the snow monsters, I guess we have built some sort of friendship. Pardon me, but may I know your name, Miss?” The words slipped out before Jia Baoyu could even think as he looked at the blushing girl.

        “...Xiao Yu,” Xiao Yu hesitated for a moment before answering.

        “What a coincidence. I have the character ‘Yu’ in my name as well.”

        “Then… I’ll call you Da Yu.”

        “Hahaha, alright, I’m Da Yu from now on,” Jia Baoyu chuckled, amused by Xiao Yu’s answer. His bright eyes sparkled with a smile as he looked at her. “Now I wonder when we shall meet again, Miss Xiao Yu?”

        “Who knows… Anyway, it’s getting late. I must go now.” Xiao Yu, who seemed a bit bashful under his gaze, hurriedly walked away. However, after going a few steps, she turned around and said softly, “Thank you for saving me earlier. See you again in another secret realm.”

        Leaving those words, the girl jumped down the mountain without looking back while Jia Baoyu was still in a daze. It was after a moment that he finally collected himself with a foolish smile tugged at the corners of his lip. “So, she hopes to see me again too.”

        Afterward, Jia Baoyu returned home with a heart brimming with joyous anticipation only to be informed that his family had arranged a marriage for him. Unwilling to comply, Jia Baoyu left home in secret to meet his soon-to-be bride, intending to cancel their engagement in person. Little did he know that there he discovered a delightful surprise...</p>
