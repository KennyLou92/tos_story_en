        <h1>Awakened Bodhicitta - Vishnu</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.7

        In a remote forest on the outskirts of Sinha, Vishnu lay sprawled next to a large magic circle, his brows deeply furrowed. His lips quiver in agitation, sweat beading his forehead—he seemed to be ensnared in a nightmare.

        After learning that Brahma was performing a magic ritual to destroy the world from Nandi, one of the subjects in Brahma’s experiment, Vishnu left Lakshmi and set off alone to confront Brahma, determined to thwart his plan.

        However, Vishnu was no match for Brahma, who had opened up all seven chakras. He fell into a deep coma after Brahma struck him with some dark forces.

        At first, he felt as if his entire body was being crushed and twisted by some powerful force. The excruciating pain of his torn sinews and veins plunged him into the depths of despair where his soul suffered endless torture with his consciousness, suffocating in the realm of destruction.

        It was not until a gentle beam of white light fell on Vishnu’s weakened soul, driving away the encroaching shadows, that he could finally have a moment to breathe and regain some semblance of reason. In his blurred vision, he saw a familiar figure standing before him—a maiden he admired, Lakshmi.

        “Vishnu, don’t worry. You will be fine,” Lakshmi gazed at Vishnu from a distance, her eyes filled with deep affection as she said, “I will protect you and shield you from those dreadful shadows.”

        “Lak…Lakshmi…” Vishnu called out her name longingly. He reached out to touch her only to find his hand passing through her body. An inexplicable unease crept up on him as he propped himself up and walked toward her. He attempted to hold her in an embrace but failed—his body passed through her!

        “What is happening?” Vishnu looked at Lakshmi with bewilderment. She gave him a faint smile, “It’s my greatest happiness to save you so that you can accomplish great missions.”

        “You—” It suddenly dawned on Vishnu what Lakshmi was doing, so he shouted, “I don’t need your sacrifice. I just want you by my side forever!”

        “No, you don’t because you can’t give up,” Lakshmi gently cupped Vishnu’s face in her hands, her eyes shining with profound wisdom capable of seeing through all things. “I know you can never give up on this world; you will do everything to protect all living beings.”

        “But I couldn’t even protect you…”

        “We will soon meet again at the origin, so don’t grieve for me,” Lakshmi’s body suddenly flickered with white light, a sign of departure. With a gentle voice, she bid Vishnu farewell, “It’s time. I have to go”

        “Please… Please don’t leave me…” Vishnu pleaded, his voice choked with reluctance.

        “We will meet again soon.” Lakshmi’s body gradually faded. Just before she completely dissolved into the air, she leaned in close to Vishnu’s ear and whispered, “I love you.”

        “Lakshmi!” Vishnu cried out in agony. Still, he could not stop Lakshmi from vanishing. A pang of grief shot through his heart, jolting him awake from the nightmare.

        When Vishnu opened his eyes, everything was shrouded by murky darkness. Yet, he did not care. His gaze fell upon the pendant he had given to Lakshmi. He picked it up and felt the lingering warmth on it. Finally, the overwhelming emotions burst into a cry of pain. Tears streamed down his face, still, unable to wash away his grief. 

        “Lakshmi… I love you too…” Vishnu choked out the words of love that he had not had the chance to say. However, a sudden change stopped him from mourning for his beloved.

        BOOM!

        A deafening crash of thunder resounded, followed by a colossal bolt of lightning flashing across the sky, splitting the heavens in half. The world seemed to be on the brink of destruction.

        “The destruction blaze is expanding…” Vishnu looked up at the sky. He finally saw the true colors of the blazes: the one on the left glowing with dark energy was steadily growing. It had grown several times larger than the one with a white glow on the right which was close to being eclipsed. 

        ‘I must protect this world. I can’t let Lakshmi down!’

        As Vishnu channeled his prana, his chakras began to flow along his breaths. Lakshmi’s love and altruism had taught him the true essence of protection; he now understood it better than anybody else. It was through this epiphany that he finally grasped the trajectory of life which allowed him to open the last chakra that he had struggled to break through. His mind began to connect to the world and its truths.

        Iridescent light circulated through every meridian of Vishnu. They converged at the heart chakra, forming a vibrant beam of white light that surged through all his seven chakras and reached the white-hued blaze in the sky. In that moment of connection, Vishnu’s soul ascended to the highest realm; he acquired a new perspective on everything.

        A colossal phantom figure made of black mist hovered before Vishnu, its form vague yet hinting at the visage of Brahma. A deep, resonant voice, transcending the fabric of consciousness, echoed within Vishnu’s soul, “So you came, Vishnu.” 

        “Brahma, I have to thank you, for it is through your actions that I have witnessed true love and selflessness. And it is for the same reason that I can’t let you destroy the world she loved, so—” Vishnu gazed at Brahma, who had merged with the destructive scarlet blaze, “I must defeat you!”</p>
