        <h1>Ignis of Draco - Agatha</h1>
        <p>        In Mount Holy Cthugha, Agatha immersed herself into the heat of fire. The Dracospirit inside her resonated with the fire elements, bringing Agatha to another life journey in the illusion…

        “You don’t like this?”
        “I have wings! I don’t need your help!”
        Waking up from a sleep, Agatha saw a blond youth so close to herself as soon as her eyes opened——Agatha immediately broke free from Honor’s arms. With mixed expressions, Honor wanted to lean forward, but Agatha stepped back promptly, knocking over a water bottle beside her.

        Despite the fact that this same scene had happened so many times, Agatha still did not know how to handle it properly, and the strange emotions that arose in her heart made her unbearable. Agatha had never been in any relationship before. What's more, she witnessed this youth growing up in front of her, just like the Dragon Follower she raised up in the past. This made her feeling even more complicated...The fire Dracospirit surrounded Agatha closely and touched the blond youth as if they were familiar to each other.

        “What am I exactly...Am I affected by the Dracospirit? What’s my feeling to him…?”

        Agatha covered herself with the dragon wings and cried. At a loss, Honor tried to reach out to touch her wings, but got rejected.

        “Just, just let me calm down alone…” Agatha suppressed her voice; clearly she was sobbing. Puzzled by her own emotions, Agatha did not respond to Honor anymore. Faced with the current situation, she did not want to leave, even if she was confused, she wanted to understand the connection between her rippling feelings and the youth in front of her...

        When Agatha got herself together, Honor had already gone. A feeling of loss struck her spontaneously, but this sense of loss made her feel even more perplexed. It was Agatha’s decision to avoid his embrace, why did she feel empty for the moment...Was it because she expected Honor to stay by her side forever? Then, Agatha got up and searched for Honor's whereabouts.

        Hustle and bustle were the theme of the city. The fountain reflected the colorful light under the sun. Lush green leaves swayed gently in the wind. Iridescent flowers were blooming brilliantly...These all added up to the season of spring. But how many times had the fall gone and spring come...Agatha had no clue about it. Searching around, she was unable to catch a glimpse of Honor, but bumped into a female demon who was about to pass out. As the demon fell into her arms, Agatha immediately carried her to sit down in the shade. The demon could not help gasping; a blush came into her pale complexion. 

        It turned out that the female demon was thirsty for blood. Agatha offered some as she could not bear to see her suffer, which had successfully relieved her symptom...The demon said her lover would soon come to pick her up. During the waiting, Agatha also talked to her about her own inner struggle.

        “Are you afraid of opening your heart because you can’t bear to lose again?”

        The words of the demon hit Agatha’s weak spot. She walked down memory lane to the prison cell, looking back at the appearance and disappearance of golden silhouettes one by one...the Dragon Followers she loved but gone for good. Every time the light ignited the holy flame, she always wanted to subconsciously avoid it, as if she would see the soul of the previous one emerging from it, and heard the only kind and loyal calls to her in the Holylight City in the past generations…

        “You are our guiding light! I can never give you up.”

        However, this voice was the only thing which created a different future for Agatha who had been imprisoned for many years. Her tears slowly dripped on the cold skin of the female demon. Such coolness made Agatha miss the warmth that she had experienced many times since the first waking from the dragon's sleep...

        Embarrased, Agatha turned away. Tears still welled up in her eyes, smearing the streets into a hazy view, and the light in front of her became more and more dazzling...Agatha wiped her tears. When she refocused, she found that the light silhouette was not an illusion, but the person she had been missing——Honor. He was running in her direction with a man in a yellow suit…

        The man picked up the female demon from Agatha’s arms. She then hugged the man back and sucked his blood with a bite without hesitation. However, Agatha’s attention was all on the blond youth before her.

        “Agatha, I——” Before he finished the conversation, Agatha held Honor tight and even covered him with her wings. Surprised, Honor slowly reached out to embrace Agatha...

        “Sorry, I haven’t had the courage to confess how I feel about you, but I won’t escape from it anymore. Failure to seize the opportunity to express my affection in time is far more terrible than losing, right?”</p>
