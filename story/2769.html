        <h1>Tokugawa the General of Decapitation</h1>
        <p>Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 7

        In order to obtain the power to destroy the Tokugawa family once and for all, Tokugawa collaborated with the mysterious man and maneuvered the survivors on the island to frequently use their experimental weapons. This time, he had picked Honda—a man who had an excellent physique—to be his guinea pig.

        By asking Hattori to kill Honda’s daughter, Komatsuhime, in front of him, Tokugawa managed to break his target’s mind and manipulate him into becoming his perfect human weapon. After that, all he had to do was to do as the mysterious man had told him—activate the magic circle in the specific spot and channel all the other survivors’ power into Honda’s body, and then he would get his wish.

        However, never would Tokugawa have expected that someone would sabotage his plan. Nobunaga, a young man, interrupted him right before he activated the magic circle. The man knocked down his delicately made zombies and even fired a gun at him.

        Just when Tokugawa thought it was the end of his life, a familiar figure suddenly stood before him. As the bullet thudded into that figure’s chest, a crimson flower of blood bloomed, indelibly seared into Tokugawa’s widened eyes like a permanent scar一

        ‘Hattori——!’ Letting out a hysterical scream, Tokugawa held Hattori’s feeble body and stopped it from leaning forward; the latter’s blood tainted his clothes with crimson.

        ‘Mas…ter…’ Hattori strenuously uttered his last word, ‘I’m sorry… but… I can’t serve you anymore…’

        ‘No… No…’ Tokugawa looked at the bloody ragged hole that was bored by the gunshot in Hattori’s chest. Tears uncontrollably streamed down his face.

        ‘Stay well…’ As soon as Hattori said his final word, the light in his eyes completely dimmed along with his last breath.

        ‘Why…’ Tokugawa murmured blankly.

        He once thought that no one’s death could ever waver him again after his mother died, but he was wrong, completely wrong. He did not know that the pain of losing someone who had been protecting him from the back all along could be so brutally excruciating that he wanted to escape from this reality; he would even give up his long-held desire in return for Hattori’s life if he could do so.

        Unfortunately, no dead could ever be brought back to life. Even the mysterious man could not resurrect his mother. Hattori’s death became the last straw that broke Tokugawa’s back, dragging him down into the bottomless pit of bleak despair until he finally drowned and fell apart.

        ‘AHHHHHH——!’ As the white mask on Tokugawa’s waist turned black, a flood of dark mist came from his back and engulfed his whole body.

        After a moment of intertwining, the dark mist eventually turned into eight arms with each holding a different weapon. Meanwhile, numerous masks appeared on Tokugawa’s body like lumps. Each of them stared at Nobunaga savagely, saying, ‘Die… I want you all to die…’

        Nobunaga immediately took up a fighting stance. Unexpectedly, Tokugawa did not charge at him but ran to the other side of the terrace where the magic circle was.

        “Crap! That guy is trying to activate the magic circle! We’ll all be dead if he makes it!” Nobunaga threw away the gun that had run out of bullets and flexed his legs to catch up. Still, he was a step behind Tokugawa.

        Watching as Tokugawa got closer to the magic circle, Nobunaga grasped the two flaming katanas—which were originally his hairpin—in his hands tightly with a deep frown. The flames on his katanas seemed to have sensed his call that they grew bigger and brighter.

        “I gotta stop him no matter what!” Widening his eyes, Nobunaga channeled his power into the katanas and made a hard slash in the direction of where Tokugawa was heading to. A wall of flames rose along with the blade of wind and blocked Tokugawa’s way, causing him to stop.

        While Tokugawa stopped, Nobunaga sped up to catch up. In the blink of an eye, he went to the back of Tokugawa and swung his swords without any hesitation. However, Tokugawa raised two of his dark mist arms to resist the former’s attacks as if he had eyes on his back. He even controlled another two arms to attack Nobunaga’s lower body.

        Nobunaga had no choice but only jumped backward to avoid it. As though Tokugawa knew that he would not be able to move one without getting rid of Nobunaga, he then turned around and faced Nobunaga directly, launching a rain of attacks with his eight arms.

        Tokugawa’s attacks were simple. There was barely any technique, but his terrifying strength and continual waves of attacks were good enough to put Nobunaga at a disadvantage.

        In that tempestuous spate of attacks, Nobunaga could only keep avoiding them without finding any chance of counterattack. He gradually lost concentration after a series of battles. Finally, he reacted a beat slower when Tokugawa slashed at his right leg. The latter’s sword stabbed his leg and brought his knees to the ground.

        Seeing that the obstacle had been immobilized, Tokugawa withdrew himself from the battle and rushed toward the magic circle. Crawling on the ground, Nobunaga tried to get up yet he fell back down due to his leg injury, and could only watch as Tokugawa stepped into the circle…

        “No… I won’t give up! I must stop him!” As Nobunaga concentrated, the two katanas responded to his thoughts again, shooting a massive pillar of flames high into the air. He then probed himself up and knelt on the ground. Holding the flaming katanas, he raised his hands.

        ‘Ha——!’ With a loud shout, Nobunaga vigorously thrust his flaming katana into the floor——

        Crack—a crack appeared in the floor after a weak dull noise. In the next second, terrible creaking and popping noises came from the floor along with countless cracks spreading toward the magic circle. Just when the spread of cracks reached its limit, the floor began to fall apart like broken eggshells with a loud boom.

        Nobunaga, Tokugawa and Honda all fell, and the magic circle was destroyed.

        ‘Cough!’ In the cloud of flying sand and dust that kept going into his mouth and nose, Nobunaga could not help but choke. When he finally managed to catch his breath after a short while, he found a shadow on his head. So he looked up only to see the rancorous face of Tokugawa.

        ‘It’s you… I’ll kill you…’ Tokugawa glared at Nobunaga with implacable hatred. All his eight arms raised the weapons in their hands. Nobunaga wanted to stand up and run away, yet he fell back to the ground and missed the chance to escape due to his wounded leg.

        Seeing the approaching weapons, Nobunaga felt surprisingly calm. He even made a mockery of himself, “At least I ruined his plan. That’s worth it.”

        Nobunaga closed his eyes, ready for the pain. However, instead of the pain, he heard a dull sound of hard objects hitting one another and Tokugawa’s roar, ‘Let-let go of me!’

        Nobunaga abruptly opened his eyes, only to find that Honda was holding Tokugawa from the back with his arms.

        ‘Kill… him… and me… to avenge… my daughter’s death…’ said Honda to Nobunaga inarticulately.

        Nobunaga saw the pink sachet that Honda clenched tightly in his right hand. The sachet probably had fallen out of Honda during the fall and awakened the little piece of consciousness that still remained in him. Yet, his body that had been contaminated by the weapon could never go back to the way it was before.

        ‘Okay. I’ll make it quick.’ Lowering his eyes, Nobunaga took the katana that had fallen to the side, then he bent his elbow and thrust it upward——

        Squish! The katana pierced through Tokugawa’s left chest and sank into Honda’s body. Blood dripped silently. At that moment, all the hatred and malice seemed to evaporate in the brink of death.

        As soon as Nobunaga retracted the katana, Tokugawa and Honda’s bodies fell to the ground. Using the sword as a cane, Nobunaga walked to their bodies and closed their eyes with his hand so that they could rest in peace.

        ‘Sigh. The experiment was so close to success, but it still failed because of some ridiculous emotions. How am I supposed to report this to Master Samael?’ A gravelly voice suddenly sounded.

        Nobunaga lifted his head in shock, only to see a good-looking man hanging in the air with a formidable aura.

        ‘Who are you?’

        Nobunaga’s question drew the man’s attention. The latter looked down at him and gave him a vicious smile, then said, ‘Since the experiment has failed, there is no point keeping this island anymore. Then let’s destroy it.’

        The whole island began to shake violently as the man snapped his fingers.

        ‘You useless pests can just die in despair!’ With a bellow of laughter, the man then disappeared into the air, leaving the perplexed Nobunaga behind…</p>
