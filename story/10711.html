        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 7

        On a hill, flowers bloomed everywhere as far as the eye could see, stretching to the horizon like a continuous tapestry of vibrant colors. Their hues softened the coldness of the colossal sword thrust into the earth, turning it into a lasting and enigmatic essence.

        Two dragons soared through the clear sky and descended before the colossal sword. The slender dragon seemed somewhat unsteady during her flight and she almost crashed to the ground when she landed. Fortunately, her robust companion swiftly caught her and ensured a safe landing.

        “Be careful, you know your body is different now,” Tyrfing, the robust dragon, warned his wife, Mistilteinn, with a grave tone. His claws still supported her body, expressing his concern through his actions.

        “There’s no need to worry so much, Tyrfing,” Mistilteinn reassured her husband with a playful grin, “Our child can’t be so fragile. It won’t disappear just because of a little impact.”

        “It’s better to be cautious,” said the taciturn Tyrfing. His serious demeanor only further amused Mistilteinn, thus she allowed him to keep supporting her. Together, the two dragons approached the colossal sword in the Gladiospire Vale, the sanctuary of the gladiospinas, the dragons of swords.

        Bowing before the colossal sword, the dragons lowered their heads devoutly to offer prayers for their unborn child.

        It was only after a moment that they raised their heads and admired the splendid scenery in silence. A sense of invisible closeness permeated between the two even with no words spoken, transforming this silent moment into a tender embrace.

        “Have you thought of a name for our child?” Mistilteinn finally broke the silence with her gentle voice.

        “...Not yet,” Tyrfing awkwardly answered.

        “I know you haven’t,” Mistilteinn chuckled before she continued softly, “That’s why I’ve already come up with two. If it’s a boy, let’s name him Gram; if it’s a girl, let’s name her Joan. What do you think?”

        “Sounds good,” Tyrfing immediately replied. As a husband who vowed to do everything in his power to make his wife happy, Tyrfing had never refused his Mistilteinn’s requests.

        Not long after, Mistilteinn gave birth to a healthy boy and they named him Gram. She even joked about having a daughter so that the other good name would not go to waste. 

        Unfortunately, their blissful days were shattered when Mistilteinn disappeared during a journey many years later. Despite Tyrfing’s relentless search, no trace or information about Mistilteinn could be found.

        While many gladiospinas believed Mistilteinn had gone for good, Tyrfing refused to accept it. He continued his search tirelessly, but his duty as the gladiospinas’ chieftain forbade him from leaving his clan and internal affairs unattended, especially during the years of frequent battles with the beasts.

        Several years ago, the phantocaudas suspected the neighboring elves of plotting an alliance with other clans to invade their territory. Under the pretense of defending their homeland, the phantocaudas launched a preemptive attack against the elves. The surviving elves, filled with resentment, rallied their forces from other friendly elf clans for retaliation. Unexpectedly, some treacherous elves took advantage of the chaos to launch attacks on other beast clans and escalate the conflict into a war.

        As time passed, the belligerent beasts grew increasingly fierce in battles, unleashing their latent aggression and brutality. Their heinous slaughter fueled hatred in their victims, and eventually, the other races and clans decided to take action and unite against them. The gladiospinas were one of the dragon clans that volunteered to help the elves, which was also why many had fallen in the past few years.

        And this was another usual day of Tyrfing, occupied with different affairs. Assuming his human form, he met with a distinguished guest who had traveled from afar in the reception room. However, it was evident that he was not fully present in the meeting—at least not mentally—as he became lost in thought multiple times during the conversation, eventually raising the guest’s suspicion.

        “Is there something troubling you on my end?” inquired Vatican, the Chief Justice of the Court of Internation Justice.

        “No, I’m sorry,” Tyrfing apologized then explained, “It has nothing to do with you. It’s my son, Gram. He has gone out for too long.”

        A few days ago, Gram, Tyrfing’s son, led a troop to rescue the floral-elves from the phantocaudas’ attack. The troop swiftly returned, except for Gram, who was preoccupied with some investigation. The shadow of his wife’s disappearance aggravated Tyrfing’s anxiety about his son’s safety, but his reserved nature forced him to keep these worries buried within him until they erupted when Vatican asked the question.

        “Gram is a prudent man with incredible prowess. I believe he will return safely,” Vatican reassured Tyrfing.

        “You’re right, thank you—”

        Suddenly, the doors swung open, followed by a tall and muscular young man striding into the room. It was none other than Gram, the son whom Tyrfing had been worried about. It seemed that he had hurried to the reception room immediately upon his return. His body was covered in dust with exposed skin bearing several still-bleeding wounds, a testament to the danger he had been through, which only fueled Tyrfing’s anger even further.

        The mixture of frustration and worry transformed into an indomitable fury that broke Tyrfing’s usual composure and pushed him over the edge. He rushed toward Gram, raising his right hand in a motion to strike, but someone stopped him before his fist could land.

        Vatican gazed calmly at Tyrfing, his face devoid of emotion, which somehow managed to quell the mounting rage inside the father.

        “Before making any judgment, one must perceive every intricacy of the story and grasp all the facts and evidence. Only by doing so can one maintian the fairest trial,” Vatican advised.

        “...You’re right. I was lost in a fit of rage,” Tyrfing admitted.

        “I’m glad you listen,” Vatican said before he released his grip on Tyrfing’s arm

        He then withdrew to the side of the room, creating space for the father and son to restart their conversation.

        “Now tell me, why did you disregard protocol and leave your troop without reporting back for days?” Tyrfing inquired while suppressing his anger.

        Gram fell silent for a moment before he finally made up his mind. He stepped forward and opened his right hand, revealing a bracelet—a worn red string threaded with a dark green gemstone.

        It only took Tyrfing a single glance to recognize the bracelet. It was a keepsake he had given to his wife, Mistilteinn before they were married.

        According to tradition, a male gladiospina would scale the highest peak near their abode to gather all precious minerals exclusive to that mountain range and present them to their beloved as a testament to their love.

        Tyrfing, too, had also flown to the summit of a towering mountain, weathering the storm, and found one particular stone for his wife, unaware that it was an extremely ordinary stone due to his limited knowledge of minerals. It was only when he handed it to Mistilteinn that he discovered its true nature.

        Although Tyrfing had suggested heading back to the mountain to find a more precious stone, Mistilteinn declined his offer with a radiant smile and treated the ordinary stone as her most precious treasure. She cherished it so dearly that she even had it embedded in her core sword.

        However, what shocked Tyrfing the most was the shakily handwritten words engraved on the stone: Joan.

[i]“...If it’s a boy, let’s name him Gram; if it’s a girl, let’s name her Joan. What do you think?”[/i]

        The words Mistilteinn said when she was pregnant with Gram echoed ceaselessly in Tyrfing’s mind. Overcome with emotions, he struggled to find words. It was after several attempts that he finally managed to ask the question in a hoarse voice, “Where did you find this?”

        “A floral-elf gave it to me. She was pursued by a humanoid girl, and she claimed that girl bore a striking resemblance to me...” Gram noticed the drastic change in his father’s expression and involuntarily hesitated before continuing, “I suspect the girl might hold some connection to Mother, and that’s why I stayed behind and did some investigation near the area. But I couldn’t find any clues, so I returned here.”

        At first, Graham grappled with hesitation, driven by a desire to shield his father from disappointment, but in the end, he chose to summon his courage and speak out the truth.

        “...This stone is indeed the one I gave to your mother. She once said that if she gave birth to a daughter, she would name her Joan,” Tyrfing said.

        “What…” Gram’s eyes widened in disbelief as he exclaimed, “So you’re saying that girl could be my sister…”

        Boom!

        Suddenly, a thunderous sound jolted Gram and Tyrfing out of their astonishing discovery. They looked out the window only to witness tongues of fire and thick smoke rising from the borders of their abode. Obviously, their clan was being attacked.

        “It’s the beasts… They came for a fight!” said Vatican, who had been standing by the window all along, squinted his eyes. His exceptional vision allowed him to observe the distant situation and discern the figures of the assailants.

        “Deal with the assailants first!” Tyrfing quickly regained his composure and spoke to Gram.

        “They must have come prepared. I’ll gather reinforcements,” Vatican said.

        “Thank you. I’ll leave that to you,” Tyrfing responded with a nod. Then, he and Gram swiftly left the room and assumed their dragon forms, soaring directly toward the source of the billowing smoke. From lofty heights, they saw numerous phantocaudas leading other beasts rampaging through their homeland.

        Without hesitation, Gram flew over to aid his kin who were in a disadvantaged position. Meanwhile, as the chieftain of the gladiospinas, Tyrfing targeted the phantocauda leader, Gomorrah, who had successfully grown her five tails into one.

        Phantocaudas are beasts distinguished by their unique tails. When a phantocauda comes into the world, they boasts five tails, each a testament to their nascent power.  Yet, as the phantocauda grows in strength, a wondrous transformation takes place—their tails gradually merge and meld, becoming one, symbolizing their unparalleled prowess.

        “Phantocauda, stop this meaningless fight,” Tyrfing spoke to the young phantocauda before him, his last shred of compassion shining through as he continued, “Leave your desire for bloodshed and you may find forgiveness.”

        However, his persuasion only received a merciless pounce which extinguished the last hope of a ceasefire between the two clans.

        With a quiet sigh, Tyrfing’s gaze shifted from one of empathy and mercy to one of ferocity and resolve as he manipulated the two core swords on his back to launch a series of precise and relentless attacks.

        On the other hand, Gomorrah persisted in attacking Tyrfing, even at the cost of having her skin gashed. She managed to deliver a heavy blow to Tyrfing, but as the battle progressed, the disparity in experience gradually became apparent. Tyrfing, who had conserved his strength, regained the upper hand on the battlefield and launched a fierce pursuit against Gomorrah.

        ‘Since the beasts persist in their obstinacy, I shall rid the world of these malignant growths, for the sake of peace!’ A hint of murderous intent flashed across Tyrfing’s eyes as he channeled his power into a deadly strike.

        However, just as Tyrfing’s swords were about to pierce through Gomorrah’s body, another sword came from a distance and collided with his swords with a resounding clang.

        Following the collision, the sword transformed into a petite girl that darted toward Gomorrah, her ethereally breathtaking countenance filled with pure concern.

        “Mistilteinn...” Tyrfing gazed at the girl who had crashed into the battlefield, her familiar features plunging him into confusion. In that instant, he knew that the girl was, beyond any doubt, his daughter, Joan, an unshakable truth that required no further evidence.

        Unfortunately, the girl did not feel that innate family bond as Tyrfind did. Instead, she glared at him with pure hatred, pointing her sword at her biological father as she shouted, “You hurt Gomorrah! I hate you! Die!”</p>
