        <h1>Explosive Mustache - Dadaru</h1>
        <p>
        Oh My Youkai - Ch.2

        Ever since the landlord’s ultimatum of achieving full house in a week, Dadaru had been rolling and rolling around, coming up with a plan to recruit guests before being turned into dead meat.

        Dadaru wouldn’t have to be the landlord’s slave if that despicable man hadn’t caught him off-guarded and stolen his mustache, which contained most of his power. And despite the slogan of “the Best Hot Spring You can Get”, this tourist attraction had no visitor, for this place had NO! HOT SPRING! AT ALL!!!

        Before the ultimatum, all Dadaru had ever done was to fake it by pouring water into the pool, simply letting the guests leave with curses as soon as they found out the fake hot spring. And that was the reason why no one would come here.

        This time, however, was different. Not only did Dadaru need to pitch for business, but he needed to compete against the other youkai fellows. If anyone failed to meet the target in one week, the youkai would become everyone’s barbecue dinner…

        But the fire-controlling ability should make him immune to being barbecued, shouldn’t it?

        Hmm, that wasn’t the point…

        Dadaru kept rolling around with his wide-opened eyes, not sure if it was something inspiring or just a meaningless rolling. All of a sudden, he shouted “DADARUMA!”, as if he had come up with a brilliant idea.

        Meanwhile, Dadaru didn’t notice a spying shadow lurking behind the shrubs…

        “Hehe, I’ll ruin it no matter what kind of good idea you got!”

        Hiding behind a tree, Furry the komainu was spying on Dadaru. This creepy behavior could trace back to the moment when Furry had decided to sabotage the other youkai’s plans so that he wouldn’t become the most useless one.

        During a whole day spying, it took Furry half a day just to watch Dadaru rolling around. When Furry barely opened his sleepy eyes at the moment when god knew how long had passed, he saw Dadaru write with a pen in his mouth, which was posted at the hot spring entrance. It seemed like a poster of some sort.

        “What? Premium Aqua Revitalizer that heals your body and mind? Sounds dope...Never expected such a good idea coming up from that dorky Dadaru. I gotta treat him seriously too,” Furry thought.

        The first thing Dadaru did the next morning was rolling around hard. His action successfully caught the attention of the passer-bys, who walked into the villa out of curiosity.

        “Huh, Premium Aqua Revitalizer? That sounds like something cool. Maybe I should give it a try to soothe my sore back!”

        Dadaru went over to serve as soon as the first batch of guests came in, leading them to the poolside. In the meantime, Furry tailed them.

        Furry then saw Dadaru roll into the pool while the guests were undressing themselves. Next second, a vibration of energy was spread and the water became warm. All the guests gave a relaxed look after immersing themselves into the water.

        “I get it! Faking a hot spring by heating up the water, huh? Humph! That’s not gonna happen! I’m gonna cool it down now!”

        As soon as Furry figured out Dadaru’s plan, he closed his eyes immediately to focus on the energy circulation, which took him a longer time since the landlord had taken his treasure away.

        Bubbles started popping on the water surface; a burning feeling ascended from the guests’ toes to their heads. That was the exact moment when the guests were going to flee like burnt frogs. The truth was that Dadaru was all about heating up the water while forgetting to control the temperature!

        At this moment, an ice spike was shot from the bushes to the water, cooling it down to the adequate temperature.

        “Oh? The spring is all good again, and it’s even more comfortable than before!” The guests returned to the pool as the water temperature was normal again.

        “Did I just help that idiot!?” Furry was very pissed off when he noticed that his ice spike had cooled down the over-heated water. 

        “Hey, I’m so refreshed by this Premium Aqua Revitalizer. We should totally come back next time!”

        “Sure! I wanna introduce it to my friends too!”

        The praise from the guests meant a desperate call to Furry, pushing him to his last resort——attacking Dadaru. As long as Dadaru couldn’t make the “hot spring” happen, he would be out of the game!

        With his head lowered, Furry took a deep breath and exhaled furiously, shooting the spike on his head at the Dadaru under the water.

        The off-guard Dadaru got stabbed in his butt! Utterly startled, he stormed around like a busted balloon, breaking into the ground with a great momentum. Next second, Dadaru exploded.

        BOOOOOOOOOOOM——!

        “Wow!”

        The guests looked at the center of the pool, which mounted a huge water stream that drew a perfect rainbow arc in the air. It turned out that Dadaru’s loose cannon accidentally discovered the water source underground, and the explosion created a path, directing the hot stream to the surface. And now it has become a real hot spring!

        “Is that an extra performance? That’s awesome——!”

        All the guests clapped and hurrayed around Dadaru, who was completely clueless about the current situation. Still, he accepted the praise with a blush. Meanwhile, Furry could only grumble behind the tree.

        “Damn——”
