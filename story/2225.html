        Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 10

        Intense clashes echoed.  A red and a black figure were having a close combat in a narrow hallway.  Ruby raised her crystallized arms to fire bullets via her barrel while rusting at Obsidian with great speed.

        “Humph! Petty Small trick!” Obsidian closed her eyes without fear.  Shutting the eyesight, Obsidian’s hearing became sensitive enough to track the trajectory of the bullets, enabling her to strike back with minimal action calmly——

        Whoosh!  In a few seconds, she struck a dozen times to cut off the coming bullets with a dagger; shells all dropped to the ground.  The students standing by applauded with amazement.

        “Tut!  You sword freakmonster!”

        “I am not!!” Obsidian made a horizontal slash angrily, but it was a miss.  Then, she continued to make another strike.  This time Ruby was unable to dodge but only parried it with her arms——

        Clash! The crystallized barrels of Obsidian began to crack under the strong attack. 

        “I’m not good at close combat.  Anyways, retreat first.” Ruby faked an attack by shooting with her right arm; the agile Obsidian then stepped back at once.

        Capturing this chance, Ruby turned around to run.  Aware of being deceived, Obsidian 

        “Where should I go...Hm?  That way is...well well, I have a good idea.” Ruby wore a grin, taking a turn into a classroom. 

        Unaware of her trickery, Obsidian went inside without hesitation——That classroom was stored with magical items.  To avoid losing their potency, all the windows were sealed with thick curtains.  Ruby was nowhere to be seen inside.  It seemed she was hiding somewhere.

        “Come out you coward!  Let’s fight!” Obsidian shouted as she carefully went further into the room, realizing that there were two legs behind the curtains.  She grinned, held her crystallized dagger tight and walked close quietly——

        “You’re fooled, idiot!” Ruby drew the curtain aside to shoot at the hook on the other curtain beside Obsidian.  The crystallized bullet hit the target; the curtain then fell to cover Obsidian entirely.

        “Now you can’t attack...What!” Ruby’s self-satisfied smile froze when she saw Obsidian slash the curtain into pieces.”

        “You thought a crappybroken piece of fabric could can stop me?  Die!” Obsidian squinted with bloodlust, holding the dagger to stab at Ruby.  Suddenly, a flash of iridescent lights stood in front of her to parry Obsidian’s attack with a crystallized sword.

        “Who are you?” Obsidian pushed harder, but it was in vain because that elf was much stronger.

        “Diamond, member of voyager club.” Diamond the “girl” took a deep breath to fling her away.

        “Voyager club...It must be Ruby’s scheme again!” Losing rationality, Obsidian burst into fury, sprinting at Diamond at once.

        Obsidian’s attacks had become more and more tricky.  However, Diamond stayed calm dodging easily and managed to strike back.  Unable to react, Obsidian saw the sword is about to graze her shoulder.  Surprisingly, it was retractedeventually came to a miss.

        Obsidian captured the chance to sting her dagger upward, successfully hitting Diamond’s chest.  In order not to let “her” stand up, Obsidian held Diamond down with her weight to suppress “her” movement.

        She pointed the dagger at Diamond’s neck with a frown, exuding with furious aura.

        “Why did you hold back?  If you didn’t, that sword would have hit me.  And you would have won!  Are you despising me?”

        “If I didn’t hold back, this your rare beauty would have been ruined.” Diamond smile as “she” picked up Obsidian’s hair.  The threads of glossy-black hair slipped down from hand, which was stunningly beautiful.

        “Em?” Obsidian was stiff after hearing Diamond’s words.

        “No one has ever treated me like that...Why my heart is pumping fast…”

        A blush came into her cheeks and ears, showing the shyness that a typical girl would be.  However, Diamond was too occupied in enduring the nausea inside him——That was how he reacted after touching a female.

        Diamond was actually a male elf.  Due to some reasons, he disguised as a female to study in this school.  While he was unable to hold any longer, Ruby caught Obsidian from behind despite her struggle.

        “Humph, just give up!  I shall teach you a good lesson to soothe my anger——AHH!” Ruby’s mischief was stopped by Amber.  She and Diamond were new members of the voyager club.

        “No more messing around,” Amber pulled her away.

        At the moment, Diamond got up and stayed calm.  “Who are you,” asked Diamond.

        “Obsidian, Chairladyman of Student Association.”

        “Chairman?  Why were you chasing after Ruby?” He asked with shock.

        “Right.” Ruby touched her chin acting like it had nothing done with herself.  “Why were we fighting actually?”

        “It’s all because of you!” Ruby’s words hit the mark, which had provoked Obsidian.

        The, she told everything to Diamond and Amber.  “Yeah...the society room is too messy.  It’s truly your responsibility.” Diamond talked to Ruby helplessly.

        “How could you be partial with this elf!  You’re heartless!  Boohoo ——!” Ruby was perfectly showing how petulant she was.

        Rolling his eyes, Diamond turned to Obsidian.  “Chairman, why don’t you join the voyager club.  I’m sure you’re Ruby’s nemesis.”

        “NO WAY!  I don’t want her in!  Absolutely don’t!” Ruby pretended to cry and denounce.  However, the other three elves also pretended not to hear.

        “Very well.  I’m in.  You can count on me to teach Ruby.”
        “Wonderful.  Welcome to the club.” Diamond reached out; With a second of hesitation, Obsidian held his hands, but got a blush again into her face…

        “Why am I falling for her…” Obsidian knew nothing about Diamond’s disguise.  She was just attractked by this elf naturally...</p>
