        <h1>Opal</h1>
        <p>Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 13

        Inside an isolated country, there nurtured a special sort of elves. The species was called minerelf, for their body structure consisted of jewels. The nation gradually thrived under the king’s rule, and this story began at the thriving age…

        Fluorescent Opal opened the door of the faculty room, bouncing to Aquamarine the boy.  “Teacher, how may I help you?” She stood upright to solute, with erected hair.

        This boy looked much younger than Opal, but in fact he was actually older than her.  Minerelves were born to have a mature body.  As time lapsed, their bodies would start peeling off, becoming smaller and smaller.  In the eyes of humans, the younger an elf looked, the older its age was.

        Aquamarine took out five papers putting in front of Opal.  “Please read the scores of these exam papers aloud.” He pulled a long face.

        “Ok...5, 6, 2, 4, 3.  Hey, they make up a straight!” Opal played a joke on him, but she had no idea her doomsday had come.

        “These are your exam papers!” Aquamarine smacked the table hard, loud enough to give the other teachers here a shock.  Opal was no exception; her hair immediately hung down out of fear.

        “100 scores is the full mark.  But you can’t score one with double digit!  Do you know how much worse your situation is?”

        “Ah...I don’t.”

        “If you keep doing this, you’ll be detained.” Aquamarine heaved a hopeless sigh.

        “Detained!” Opal broke down as she heard the truth.  Then she started shaking Aquamarine’s bodies non-stop.  “No, please don’t!  I can’t be detained!  Please help me!”

        “Stop it!” As he ordered, Opal immediately refrained from misbehaving.

        Then, Aquamarine got rid of her hands and announced after a deep breath.  “Listen, this is the last chance.  Pass all the tests next week.  I’ll plea for the principal’s leniency.  Otherwise, you detain.”

        “...Can I just score double digit instead…?”

        “...How about I get you detained now?”

        “NO!  Please!  Boohoo!  I promise I’ll pass the tests!  Boohoo!” Opal knelt down to beg for mercy.  As Aquamarine brushed her off, Opal had no choice but to leave.

        “All pass...It sounds like impossible for me...That means I’ll be detained...NOOO!  AHHHH!” Opal cried like a baby.

        Sinking into sorrow, she was not aware that her hem was accidentally hooked by something on the wall.  As she moved, the cotton threads were also dragging away.  Soon, her upper garment became shorter and shorter.

        A “girl” Diamond just passed by and witnessed that.  So “she” ran to remind her.

         “Your clothes are hooked!” Diamond shouted, but Opal turned a deaf ear while crying.  Then Diamond sped up to run ahead of her.  Still, Opal, whose waist was already exposed, ignored him and walked away directly.

        “Sooner or later, she’ll be naked...I should do it by force then!” Diamond raised “her” hands, sprinting at Opal——

        Bang!  She was pushed to the wall.  Trapped between Diamond’s arms, she thought it was a pervert of some sort.

        “Heyyyy...what-what is it about?” Opal stopped crying anymore.

        “Your clothes are hooked...It’s about to be torn off…”

        “Oh right, thank you for telling me.” Opal wore a brilliant smile, totally unaware that she was almost half-naked.  Embarrassed, Diamond turned “her” face away.

        “Cover yourself now.  It’ll be bad if other elves see you.”

        “We’re all female.  I don’t mind that.”

        “Urhh…” Diamond was hard to tell the truth, because he was not female indeed.  Due to some reasons, he disguised as a female to study in this girls’ school.

        “Why, why were you crying,” he had no choice but to shift the topic.

        When it came to her sorrows, tears welled up in her eyes again.  While Opal was telling Diamond everything, she was recalling the cotton threads.  During the conversation, Diamond kept covering her as he listened to the story.

        “Exam...Why bother to study if you hate that much?  The tuition fee here is not cheap,” he asked out of curiosity.

        “I don’t want to.  But in order to achieve my dream, I have to study and graduate!” Opal clenched fists; her hair was also swaying because of her flaming spirit.

        “What do you mean?”

        “My dream is to become a fashion designer, to design my own apparel.  See——”

        Opal triggered power to conjure several crystallized needles.  With a wave of her hand, the broken part was re-knitted by the collected cotton threads like brand new in a flash; Diamond was amazed at the moment.

        “But my parents don’t let me do it.  We had a few quarrels before reaching an agreement and my father set a condition.  If I can graduate, I chase my dream to be a designer.  But I’m too stupid...I couldn’t understand what the teacher said...Boohoo...What should I do…”

        So, Opal cried again.  How miserable.

        “Her story is similar to me…” Diamond knew how she felt out of sympathy.

        “Let me help you.”

        “Em?” Opal was confused gazing at him. “I’ll be your tutor, and help you pass the tests!” Diamond wore a confident smile.</p>
