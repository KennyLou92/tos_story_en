        <h1>Lion-headed Misadventure - Han Xiangzi</h1>
        <p>
                As a result of a prank gone wrong, Han Xiangzi accidentally released the evil spirit in a mirror. The evil spirit lunged toward Han Xiangzi the moment the seal was broken. To protect him, He Xian’gu ended up being dragged into the mirror. Overwhelmed by guilt, Han Xiangzi sought help from Taishang Laojun to rescue He Xian’gu.

        Examining the mirror, Taishang Laojun shook his head.

        “Taishang Laojun… What is it?” Han Xiangzi asked nervously. 

        “The evil spirit has dragged He Xian’gu into the world inside the mirror, and it is currently absorbing her Xian energy. Her soul will scatter if we don’t manage to save her within four hours. In order to do so, we must work together. I need you to enter the mirror and rescue her while I will sustain the exit.” Taishang Laojun said solemnly.

        The news of a possible solution slightly dispelled Han Xiangzi’s anxiety, and he promptly nodded in agreement. As Taishang Laojun cast a spell on the mirror, a beam of light emerged and transported Han Xiangzi into the mirror world.

        When Han Xiangzi opened his eyes, all he could see was a dense fog. Faced with the unknown realm, even someone as playful as Han Xiangzi dared not make a reckless move but cautiously feel his way through the fog.

        “Hehehe.”

        Suddenly, Han Xiangzi heard a peal of sinister laughter behind him, but he saw no one when he turned around.

        Frowning, Han Xiangzi turned back and continued moving forward. However, something icy cold grabbed his ankle after he took a few steps. He quickly shook it off and stumbled forward. Just when he managed to steady himself, he felt the coldness tugging at his right arm.

        Although Han Xiangzi tried to grab hold of the evil spirit, it let go of his arm and started nudging him from another direction. It was obvious that the spirit was toying with him.

        “Heh-heh-heh.”

        Another burst of sinister laughter echoed from all directions, only fueling Han Xiangzi’s anger. ‘How dare this evil spirit play me like a toy! As the king of pranks, I shall teach it a lesson!’

        Closing his eyes, Han Xiangzi regulated his breathing and focused all his energy.

        “I got you!” As Han Xiangzi sensed a faint air movement behind his shoulder, he extended his hand without a backward glance and successfully grabbed hold of the icy thing—a cold wrist.

        “Reveal yourself” Han Xiangzi shouted, exerting all his strength to pull on the wrist. He forcefully dragged the person out of the dense fog, letting them fall to the ground. Only then did he see the true face of the evil spirit—a young boy with blue skin.

        Dazed from the impact, the evil spirit was surprised when he saw Han Xiangzi, who was staring at it fiercely.

        “Release He Xian’gu immediately!” Han Xiangzi demanded.

        “Heh! No, I won’t! What can you do to stop me? Once I absorb all the energy of that Xian, the rest of you will all perish!” The evil spirit glared back at Han Xiangzi, its body emitting an ominous glow.

        “What can I do to stop you, you ask? Humph! Let me show you the essence of a prank!”

        As Han Xiangzi spoke, he summoned his cloak and infused it with his Xian energy. He threw the radiant lion-headed cloak into the air. In an instant, the cloak transformed into an auspicious lion ten times larger than Han Xiangzi himself.

        Realizing the impending danger, the evil spirit attempted to flee but was caught in the lion’s jaws.

        “You should feel lucky. No one has experienced this ‘first-class seat’ before,” Han Xiangzi chuckled with a brilliant smile as he leaped onto the lion’s back. With the evil spirit held in the lion’s mouth, they raced through the dense fog at an astonishing speed.

        The lion’s speed gradually increased within the mist until it appeared as a golden streak of light. It was such a velociously rough ride that even the evil spirit’s blue face turned pale due to the giddiness.

        The dense fog, created by the evil spirit’s power, allowed the spirit to heighten its senses and effortlessly toy with those who entered the world inside the mirror. Never the evil spirit would have thought its advantage would turn against itself.

        “Are you going to release He Xian’gu or not?”

        “No!”

        “Xiao Shi! Shake him!” Noticing the evil spirit’s discomfort, Han Xiangzi commanded the lion to vigorously shake its head which intensified its dizziness. The spirit’s face turned purple as it felt a burn in its throat, seeing stars in its vision.

“Yes or no?”

        “I...I…”

        “Xiao Shi! Flip him, ten times!” Han Xiangzi gave another command while snapping his fingers.

        The lion immediately followed the command, hurling the evil spirit into the air and catching it just before it hit the ground.

        After several flips, the evil spirit was on the brink of collapse. As the lion prepared to flip it once more into the air, the spirit trembled and weakly raised its hand, saying, “Wait… I’ll talk…”

        However, the evil spirit’s surrender only let to a wicked grin on Han Xiangzi’s face.

        “Go on, Xiao Shi,” he commanded.

        “Wh-... WHY?!” pleaded the evil spirit in disbelief.

        “Because it’s fun!” Han Xiangzi replied with a smile that was so radiantly genuine that send a faint chill down the spirit’s spine.
        “Just kill me already!” the evil spirit cried out in despair. Still, its cry did not stop the lion from throwing it into the air again. After dozens of flips, the evil spirit finally vomited up all that it had had in its stomach and could only lie feebly on the ground.

        With all its fighting spirit drained, the evil spirit took Han Xiangzi through the dense fog to where He Xian’gu was. Together, the two returned to reality through the exit sustained by Taishang Laojun.

        Upon seeing Taishang Laojun, the evil spirit rushed forward and grabbed his robe, crying out desperately, “Please capture me now! You were the one who sealed me all those years ago. Now seal me once again! I’d rather be confined in the mirror than ever see that monster again!”

        “Ahem,” Han Xiangzi cleared his throat disapprovingly as he heard the spirit refer to him as “that monster”.

        “I mean the great Xian! Great Xian!” the evil spirit hastily corrected itself, acting its most obedient self ever, which left He Xian’gu and Taishang Laojun dumbfounded.

        Later, Xian’gu and Han Xiangzi left Taishang Laojun’s residence as he prepared to reseal the evil spirit within the mirror.

        “Um… He Xian’gu… Are you... alright?” Han Xiangzi asked, wearing a remorseful and dejected expression that resembled a wilted eggplant.

        Throughout all of Han Xiangzi’s pranks in the past, he had never truly harmed anyone. Yet, his prank this time had nearly cost He Xian’gu’s soul, and the thought of that made him feel repentant.

        “You did something wrong, so of course, you must ace the consequences,” He Xian’gu said solemnly, then slowly approached Han Xiangzi.

        Instead of attempting to escape as usual, Han Xiangzi obediently raised his head, closing his eyes to accept his punishment—

        “Ah! Ouch!” Han Xiangzi winced, rubbing his forehead reddened after He Xian’gu’s flick.

        “Now we’re ever,” she said.

        “Huh? That’s all?” Han Xiangzi looked at He Xian’gu, his mouth agape with surprise.

        Amused by his reaction, He Xian’gu asked, “What? That wasn’t enough for you? You haven’t finished copying the rule book yet, remember?” 

        As soon as He Xian’gu finished speaking, Han Xiangzi swiftly donned his lion-headed cloak and flew up into the air. Making a funny face at her, he retorted, “Humph! I’m never going to copy the rule book!”

        Watching Han Xiangzi’s receding figure, He Xian’gu could not help but smile and whisper, “That’s the Han Xiangzi I know.”

        Just then, a piece of paper fell in front of He Xian’gu, with the words written on it: Sorry, old bat! 

        “Han Xiangzi! Who are you calling an old bat?” As usual, He Xian’gu bellowed with rage as she saw the paper.</p>
