        <h1>Plains of Starfire - Phanes</h1>
        <p>
                During the raging war between humans and the gods at the entrance to the realm of gods, Phanes, the God of Fire, threw himself into the fray. Eventually, he grew exhausted, leaning against a wall to seek respite. The elements enveloped his body and began to replay memories of the past in his mind…

        In the distant past, Khaos embarked on a cosmic odyssey in search of a new home for his people, and Phanes, blessed with exceptional talents, became a courtier of Khaos.

        Unfortunately, in his eagerness to please Khaos, Phanes entrusted a planet with potential to Khaos’ son, Erebus, to explore. However, Erebus subjectively deemed the planet unsuitable for habitation and returned only with the resources he depleted from it, disregarding the original purpose of the mission.

        Khaos, of course, was infuriated upon learning the failed mission. He not only punished Erebus but also also expressed deep disappointment in Phanes for instigating the ill-fated decision behind the scenes.

        To regain Khaos’ trust, Phanes devoted sleepless nights to patrolling and surveying the cosmos, tirelessly searching for potential planets with previous resources that would appease Khaos. After days of searching, he finally found one.

        ‘This planet is marvelous! Though it may not be suitable for us to live, the celestial remnants that form it give birth to everlasting sparks of life, which can give us boundless energy! Lord Khaos will surely be pleased to know this!’

        Phanes’ eyes lit up with excitement as he gazed at the planet engulfed in blazing flames before him. Unable to contain his anticipation, he eagerly approached the planet and landed on its hardened surface, only to feel a powerful tremor that shook the ground.

        Initially, Phanes assumed it was a routine seismic activity of the planet. But as the tremors intensified and he sensed the surface shifting, he realized something was amiss so he swiftly leaped into the air. Yet, a dark figure came charging at him at a ferocious speed, giving Phanes little time to react that he only managed to raise his arms in defense. He felt a numbing sensation in both his arms as his body was forcefully pushed back.

        It was after his body stabilized that he could see the assailants—two enormous rock creatures standing menacingly on the planet’s surface, glaring at Phanes with their mouths slightly agape. Then, they spewed forth flames capable of scorching all creation.

        ‘They must be the indigenous creatures of this planet, born from the fiery essence contained within the celestial remnants,’ Phanes thought. “Judging by their attack just now, they possess formidable strength and heat resistance. They are worthy adversaries indeed.’

        Phanes’ brain began to spin, speedily processing the information, but the rock creatures seemed unwilling to let him contemplate. Soon after they drew in the flames around them, they swiftly conjured two massive fire balls before their mouths and took aim at him.

        A searing wave of heat surged toward Phanes, evaporating the moisture on his skin and leaving a parched sensation. Yet, in the face of such terrifying heat, Phanes did not falter. Instead, he met it with confidence, extending his hands to catch the blazing fireballs.

        “I fear no flame, no matter how strong it is, for I am the mightiest God of Fire!” Phanes exclaimed. Harnessing the power within him, he transformed into another manifestation of flames, enveloping the incoming fireballs. At first, the two flames engaged in a struggle, none of them willing to yield. However, the radiance of the fireballs gradually dimmed as Phanes’ flames consumed it entirely.

        “Phew, the fire on this planet is truly remarkable. It refuses to accept defeat and seeks an opportunity to retaliate even after assimilation,” Phanes chuckled confidently. “But it has no hope to win! Now it’s my turn!”

        With a wave of Phanes’ hands, the two fireballs split into an array of countless small fire bullets before him. As he closed his fingers into a fist, the fiery projectiles shot forth like rain, targeting the joints and weak spots of the rock creatures, causing intense explosions.

        The series of explosions shattered the two rock creatures from within, turning their once indomitable forms into pieces and putting an end to their lives completely.

        “All right, now that the enemies have been vanquished, it’s time to get what I need.”

        Phanes landed on the planet once again. Without interference from the rock creatures, he successfully harvested all the energy of the planet and compressed it into a single red ore before returning to the realm of gods. Despite his weariness from the battle, he did not rest but went directly to see Khaos.

        “Phanes, what is it?” Khaos seemed less than pleased, his gaze filled with impatience as he looked at Phanes.

        “Lord Khaos, I have discovered an intriguing planet. It possesses an everlasting flame, and I have extracted its power for you.” Phanes respectfully presented the red ore to Khaos, hoping for praise and recognition.

        Unfortunately, Khaos’ reaction was far from what Phanes had anticipated.

        “I have already assigned Aether the task of planetary exploration. You can just give it to her,” Khaos said, showing no surprise at Phanes’ discovery and instead knitting his brow as if annoyed.

        “But the power is—”

        “That’s enough, Phanes. I need to focus on building the new realm of gods. I don’t have time for such trivialities. Just go find Aether, and don’t make me say it twice.”

        “...Yes, Lord Khaos.” Phanes felt a deep sense of discontentment, but he could only swallow his emotions facing Khaos’ scrutinizing gaze. Knowing that he had missed the opportunity to gain Khaos’ trust, he reluctantly handed over the hard-earned red ore to Aether…</p>
