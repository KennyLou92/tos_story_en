        <h1>Lightblessed Trailblazer Uriel</h1>
        <p>A serious and honest angel. She is loyal to the Almighty and is trusted as the guide of the Heavens.
Uriel guards the gate to the Heavens, where good souls rest until the day of selection, which comes once every several thousand years. On the day of selection, souls are tested by the Almighty, and those who are recognized as having outstanding qualities are given a sign of blessing. Uriel, foreseeing the coming of the day of selection, creates a door to bring souls out of the Heavens with the holy key entrusted to her by the Almighty, and leads them to the place of selection.</p>
