        <h1>Love Holocaust - Abadon</h1>
        <p>Origin of Demons - Supreme Reckoning Story Ch. 1

        As the ringing sound of the communication device horned in on the sweet atmosphere between Abadon and Beelzebub, she looked at Abadon with worries all over her face.

        “Brother...”
        “Don’t worry.” After taking out the device, Abadon shut it down decisively and pulled the anxious Beelzebub into his arms, saying, “We will stay together forever. No one can break us apart.”

        “Yes, Beelzebub just wants to stay with you…” Beelzebub, who gained courage from Abadon’s warm hug, soon loosened up and held him back with her arms, circling a corner that only belonged to the two of them.

        Later, Abadon and Beelzebub went around the main battlefields between gods and demons and lived in a remote mountain. Sadly, their tranquil life didn’t last long—Baal sent two demons, Leviathan and Belphegor, to them.

        They had a fierce fight, which eventually ended with the successful escape of Abadon and Beelzebub. Just when Leviathan wanted to chase after them resentfully, the sound of the communication device stopped her. It was a call from Baal. 

        “Oh, so he betrayed Belial for his little pet?” Baal’s deep voice melted Leviathan’s heart. “Then there’s no need to pursue them. He’ll soon come to me.”

        Leviathan didn’t know why Baal had such confidence, but for her unconditional trust in him, she left with Belphegor, letting Abadon and Beelzebub run away.

        Abadon and Beelzebub found another place to live a secluded life, yet that was just the start of a nightmare—Beelzebub fell sick. For some reason, her body was running a fever that no medicine could cure.

        ‘This is not a common illness…’ Suddenly, Abadon had an epiphany. As he looked at the fragile Beelzebub lying in the bed, he gritted his teeth and made up his mind. He then picked up the communication device that had been left out for a long time and dialed it. Soon, a male voice sounded, “You finally call me, Abadon.”

        “You did that to Beelzebub.”

        “Yeah, I mixed it in the first medicine given to her. It was supposed to be a safety pin but I didn’t know that you take her so seriously.”

        “What do you want?”

        “Worry not. I’m not as ignorant as my spoiled brother. I play fair. Just get me Mastema’s soul and your debts to me shall be settled.”

        “...Fine.” Abadon had no other choice, no matter he believed Baal or not, so he resolutely said yes.

        ‘Belial has great trust in Azazel. Something as important as Mastema’s soul must be entrusted to him. Maybe I’ll find a clue in his room.’

        And so, Abadon asked the neighboring villagers to look after Beelzebub while he sneaked into the base of demons alone. With his memories from the past, he went to Azazel’s room through a secret tunnel and surprisingly found the container that captured Mastema’s soul right in a cabinet.

        Just when Abadon was about to leave with the container after breaking the magical lock with tremendous effort, he felt a hint of malice arising behind his back so he immediately sprang to the right and barely dodged the water ball thrown at him. The water ball contained brute force that smashed the cabinet into pieces.

        “How dare you traitor come back!” When Azazel, who was already boiling with rage, saw the container in Abadon’s hand, his fury mounted to another level that he shouted aloud, “How dare you try to steal the thing of Master Belial. Inexcusable!”

        Azazel conjured water elements and formed them into a giant water ball, then he threw it at Abadon.

        Maintaining his composure, Abadon put the container into his arms and conjured elements with a derisive laugh. His arms then burst into flames. As he raised his arms, the water ball stopped with a boiling sound and disappeared shortly.

        “That’s all you got? Now it’s my turn,” said Abadon, who pounced on Azazel, lifting his blazing arms. The latter dodged him ignominiously and soon was cornered to a wall.

        Just as Abadon was about to give him the last blow, his body shuddered the moment he met Azazel’s eyes. He pulled back at once; still, he was not quick enough—a sharp blade cut off his left forearm from behind.

        “Argh——!” Screaming in pain, Abadon still managed to leap backward.

        “Tut! You only got his left forearm.” Azazel smacked his tongue regrettably.

        “He has great reflexes, too great that he retreated the moment he saw me in your eyes,” said the swordswoman, Samael, shaking the blood and bone fragments off her sword.

        “So what? Now he is outnumbered and injured. It is only about time that he loses.” Azazel snorted jubilantly, “I will not spare anyone who betrays Master Belial.”

        Standing the agonizing pain, Abadon saw the murderous Azazel and Samael. With cold water poured on his pompous vigor, bleak despair began to creep up on him. However, his will was reignited when Bezeelbub’s face flashed across his mind.

        ‘I can’t lose… Beelzebub is still waiting for me!’</p>
