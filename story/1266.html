        <h1>Thorns of Demon Blood - Louis</h1>
        <p>        “This is my promise — I shall govern this empire with a true heart. My vow shall never falter.”
        After taking back the throne, Louis not only took care of the mess Prince William created, but also rebuilt relationships with the officials. Inheriting his father’s wisdom, Louis enforced people-oriented policies, reduced tax, and effectively used corrupted money to help out the poor. He loved his people and kept thinking of new ways to effectively rule the country. Within half a year, his previous image as a madman has completely been swept away.

        Although Louis became busier and could only write to Edward with the swallow's help, he always saw Edward as a role model.

        However, Louis never had enough time to rest. After the day he stood on edge of the cliff with Louis, the demonic force hidden in his body awakened. He dreamed the same dream every night where he became a black skeleton and wandered the city, hunting his people. However, he could never swallow the flesh and blood of his killed subjects, so he kept hunting, killing, and biting but remained hungry forever…

        Every time he woke up from the nightmare, his neck would suffer from a straining kind of pain. At first he paid little attention to it, but day after day, the veins on his neck turned darker and began to burn, wrapping around his neck like burning black bones. At the beginning, he covered his neck with his robe, but after a few days, his pupils were turning red and horns began to grow from his head. Now, nothing can cover his demonic appearance. To avoid suspicion, Louis placed a curtain between him and the officials during meetings as well as stopped visiting Edward.
        The brothers were driven apart as one was too afraid to show his face, while the other…

        As the old saying goes, “You can’t wrap fire with paper.” One day, Louis woke up from the same nightmare as usual, only to find himself wrapped  in black veins with gloomy air surrounding and slowly suffocating him. He dashed towards the window, only to see a reflection of a huge dark shadow. People crashed into and pushed each other as well as stretching their hands in hopes of finding safety, while shouting: "I can't see anything!” The whole city was in chaos.

        Louis did not have time to cover his appearance anymore. He grabbed his  robe and rushed out. All the servants and guards were waving their arms, trying to find a safe path, like blind people. Only he can see clearly. “What about Edward? Is he also…?” Upon seeing the chaos, Louis immediately thought of Edward and ran to his room. Surprisingly, upon opening the door, the swallow was tightly holding a dark figure...

        “Edward? What happened!?” Louis pushed the swallow’s wing aside, but as soon as he touched Edward’s body, he was startled to find that Edward’s body was hard as stone!

        “What's happening?” Louis said worriedly. The swallow had no choice but tell Louis that Edward had sacrificed himself to defend the demonic power of the ring but pretended to smile all the time...


        “Is this the ring?” The ring on Edward’s finger glimmered. Louis wanted to take off the ring but was immediately stopped by the swallow, “ Don’t! Without the ring, Edward may shatter into smithereens!” At that moment, Louis had already held onto Edward's cold hands when the ring suddenly transformed into a claw and wrapped itself around Louis's finger!

        “I...I feel like!” A chill ran through Louis while the feeling of strain and and heat faded away. He touched his neck, and surprisingly, the black veins and the horns on his head  disappeared! When he touched his eyes, he saw the black skeleton in his nightmares drift away…


        “Your highness! Are you alright?” The swallow asked. When Louis came to, he noticed that Edward's ring had already transferred onto his finger. The ring absorbed his overwhelming demonic power, which eliminated the horns on his head, red pupils, and the black veins that covered his whole body, turning him back to normal. The moment Louis regained his normal appearance, the grey clouds that covered the city  also dispersed. The citizens on the streets regained their sight; they looked at each other with great confusion, as if they just woke up from a nightmare.

        While Louis was startled by this sudden change, the stone layer that covered  Edward was also began to tear apart, revealing Edward’s white skin bit by bit. After the last pieces of stone fell off Edward's eyelids, Edward was himself again. Edward weakly said: “Brother…” Louis happily cried and tightly hugged Edward.

        “It seems like the ring has found its master.” The swallow happily smiled, seeing the two brothers reunited.
        “Edward, let’s work hard for our country.” Louis smiled. While Edward,  in front of him, smiled like the sun...</p>
