        <h1>The Merry Puppy</h1>
        <p>
                Merry Puppy and Grumpy Puppy had lived together since they were born.  They had been each other’s most reliable companions.  During the day, they would go on endless journeys; when night came, they would look for shelter.  The puppies would find food in forests when they felt hungry, and drink water from streams when they were thirsty...

        Neither knew how long they had journeyed.  They had threaded through forests, stroded across barren wasteland, climbed up mountains and waded through rivers.  Free and unfettered, they had roamed through many places, immersing themselves in the joy of playing along the journey.  Though they had passed towns and villages, the puppies never stayed anywhere; it was as if they were driven by something unknown to continue their journey... 

        They came to a vast forest.  Merry Puppy, which only thought about playing, walked in the front, curiously sniffing around with its nose.  The collected Grumpy Puppy stayed closely behind it in silence, carefully observing their surroundings while watching over  its companion. 

        Suddenly, Merry’s eyes were caught by the sight of seemingly sweet and juicy fruit on a tree.  Deeply attracted, it stopped and gazed fixedly at them.  Grumpy could already guess what its companion was thinking, but by the time it wanted to stop Merry, it was already too late.  With just a leap, it clutched onto a branch of the tree with its teeth.  This left Merry hanging high up on the tree...  Down below, Grumpy was barking worriedly, but Merry paid no attention to it.  At that moment, all it cared for were those aromatic fruit. 

        Merry abruptly released its jaw, and started falling.  Just before it hit the ground, a shadow was seen dashing out from the woods and caught it with his hands... 

        “That was close...  Are you alright?”  The young man asked while softly stroking Merry Puppy, which was in his embrace.  He did not notice the other puppy until Grumpy Puppy approached him and gave him a bark. 
 
        “This is your friend, right?”  The young man squatted down, and placed Merry Puppy beside Grumpy Puppy, continued, “Don’t ever do this anymore. You won't be that lucky — can’t escape death every time!”  With that, the young man turned and walked away. 

        Merry Puppy had realized the purpose of its endless journey the moment it looked into the young man's eyes and found him looking back.  It hurried forward and said to itself, ‘That young man is the destiny I have been searching for!’  Since Merry Puppy deeply believed in that, Grumpy Puppy could only follow it in search of the young man.  It did not feel as Merry did; it simply naively viewed Merry Puppy as its sole family... </p>
