        <h1>Mothra</h1>
        <p>
        Mothra first appears in MOTHRA (1961). Mothra’s life cycle begins as a larval creature that hatches from an egg. Later the Mothra larva is able to produce a strong silk-like thread that it uses to weave a cocoon around itself. During this stage it metamorphoses before finally emerging as a winged adult. The silken thread Mothra produces also serves as one of its most useful weapons thanks to its strength. Mothra’s poisonous scales are another defense it employs to painful effect against Godzilla and other kaiju. Although Mothra’s size changes film to film, its basic design, powers and personality remain familiar. Able to fly across oceans, battle massive kaiju and protect the natives who worship it, Mothra is often called the most beautiful kaiju, thanks to the rich colors of its adult form’s wings.</p>
