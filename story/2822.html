        <h1>Wings of Tempest - Shu</h1>
        <p>        After the Spiritual Civilization, Shu and Tefnut once again set out on a journey.

        This time, they went to a small village. Built on a mountain, the village held fertile farmland with simple folk customs. The villagers didn’t show any opposition when they saw the two foreigners; instead, they gathered around curiously and chatted.

        Just when the two were leaving, a breath of damp wind came towards them. Seeing the grey cloud looming on the horizon, Tefnut had a feeling, ‘there will be torrential rain here... no, a flood, and I can't stop such a catastrophe.’

        ‘We have to tell the humans nearby,’ Shu, who couldn’t bear the death of innumerable living creatures, said, ‘so that they can find a shelter as soon as possible. I want to save every one of them with all I can do.’

        So Shu and Tefnut together went to tell the villagers to take refuge. Following a rumble of thunder, raindrops the size of peas fell on the land; soon it started pouring rain. Luckily, thanks to the heads-up of Shu and Tefnut, the villagers were evacuated in advance.

        Shu and Tefnut took the villagers to a nearby highland for protection. By the time they looked at their homes from the highland, the torrential rain had already submerged the village completely.

        As the water level continued to rise, Shu and Tefnut instructed the villagers to build a simple dyke with the branches and soil close at hand. However, the rain came quicker than they had expected. Like a thousand troops, a raging torrent of rubble and soil ran down the mountain to where they were.

        Before the power of the earth, anyone would seem weak and insignificant. Holding out her arms strenuously, Tefnut used all her powers to slow down the flood with water elements, yet the flood still came nearer and nearer.

        Just when the flood was about to inundate this little high land, a figure stood in front of all villagers. Under a strong burst of light, Shu conjured his powers and built a thick soil wall to block the torrent for everyone.

        However, the flood kept hitting the wall. Suddenly, thin cracks appeared on the wall after the hitting sound of several boulders in the torrent. Sweat beaded Shu’s forehead. As he kept repairing and maintaining the wall with his powers, his face turned pale and drawn in an instant.

        ‘Shu!’ Tefnut screamed in panic.

        ‘I’m okay! Leave it to me! You keep controlling the water flow!’ Shu kept channeling his power to protect the island. His mind slowly reeled due to the loss of strength.

        Just then, a massive landslide swirled the nearly unconscious Shu away, putting him in endless darkness.

        “I… got buried by the landslide… I have to get out quickly…” As much as Shu wanted to move, his exhaustion made it an impossible mission. Even if he tried to channel his powers, he couldn’t concentrate his mind to do so.

        After an uncertain period of time—when he was about to sink to the depths of despair—he saw a ray of light. Then pairs of hands covered in mud and calluses dug him out of the darkness.

        Fresh air wafted in. As Shu gasped and took a deep breath, his mind came back to him from turmoil.

        ‘Shu!’ Tearfully, Tefnut ran into Shu’s arms.

        Sitting up straight, Shu saw the villagers around him. All their nails were broken, stained with blood and mud. They should be in acute pain but they all flashed a radiant smile when they found that Shu was still alive.

        “They did this to save me…” Shu was impressed. He once believed that humans were all horrid and vile for he had seen their greed and malice in the past. Yet, now he knew how arrogant he was.

        “There are good and bad in this world. That’s exactly why as the ones who hold powers, we should guide them to good instead of abandoning them.”</p>
