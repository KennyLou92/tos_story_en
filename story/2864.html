        <h1>Jade of Firmament - Qing Gui</h1>
        <p>        Heshi and Qing Gui were receiving a refugee that had fled from a neighboring country in their house. The man’s clothes were soiled and his hair was tousled; he looked petrified.

        “Don’t worry. It’s safe here. You can take all the time you need. Can you tell us what happened?” asked Heshi gently.

        “A dragon, it’s a dragon! A giant dragon killed everyone! My home, my family are all gone…” The man said in tears, “He said his name was, uh, something like Xuan…”

        “...Xuan Huang.” Qing Gui froze for a moment when he heard the man. Then, he uttered a name in a deep voice. Lifting his head, he looked at the man and asked, “Did he call himself Xuan Huang?”

        “Yes! That’s the name!” The refugee answered, only to see Qing Gui’s face darkened.

        Heshi, who sensed something wrong, called someone to take the refugee away, then he asked, “Qing Gui, what happened between you and Xuan Huang…”

        Although Qing Gui wanted to keep Heshi away from the Runedragon business, he did not want to lie either so he briefly explained.

        “...Xuan Huang is from my clan, who has broken the clan’s taboo. And that’s why I’m here to take him back. There’s no need for you to be worried because it’s none of your business.”

        “What do you mean by none of my business? You’re my friend. How can I just sit back when my friend is in trouble?!”

        “Heshi, have you forgotten? You’re not only my friend but also the landlord of this city. You have your responsibility.”

        Heshi wanted to say something, but the words stuck in his throat. An awkward silence fell between the two for a while. Even as Qing Gui, who felt sorry, was about to smooth things over, Heshi spoke. 

        “Okay, I got it.” Heshi closed his eyes and took a deep breath as if he had made up his mind, then he shouted at the door, “Gather round all the officials for me.”

        Puzzled, Qing Gui wanted to ask Heshi questions, yet the latter did not give him even a chance to speak. Soon, all the officials came one after one. Without wasting any time on greeting, Heshi delegated his duties as the governor to the officials. Then he dismissed the meeting after making sure that all of them had no problem, leaving only him and Qing Gui in the room again.

        “What are you…” Qing Gui looked at Heshi speechlessly, while Heshi gave him a bright smile and said, “I’ve taken care of my duties as the landlord so don’t try to stop me. I’m helping you this time!”

        Seeing that mischievous smile on Heshi’s face, Qing Gui let out a resigned sigh, knowing that there was no point in arguing because no one could stop Heshi once he had made up his mind even though he looked very easy-going.

        And so, Qing Gui turned back to his dragon form and flew to that country where the refugee came from with Heshi riding on his back in the middle of that night.

        When Heshi finally saw the city lights after flying in the tormenting cold wind for half of the night, he perked up but soon found something off.

        “This… is strange… The town is bustling; the buildings and roads are all intact. It doesn’t seem that it has been rampaged… Oh no! It’s a trap! Qing Gui, let’s turn around now——Argh!”

        Unfortunately, it was too late—a gigantic shadow pounced on Qing Gui from a height. Having little time to avoid it, Qing Gui was knocked flying while Heshi, who was on his back, was also thrown into the air.

        “Heshi!” screamed Qing Gui, who was only relieved when he saw Heshi hang in mid-air by holding on to a scale of that giant shadow—Xuan Huang, the purple dragon.

        However, that sense of relief did not last long—unable to withstand Heshi’s weight, that scale fell off Xuan Huang’s body and started plunging downward along with Heshi, who was holding on to it!

        Qing Gui’s mind went blank with only one thought left, which was to save Heshi. Yet, Xuan Huang came his way so he could only watch as Heshi’s body disappeared into a dense forest.

        “It’s me… It’s all my fault… He died because of me!” At that moment, Qing Gui felt a burst of mounting rage at not only himself but also the culprit who caused everything—Xuan Huang.

        “Xuan Huang! I’m gonna kill you!”

        “Try it if you can. Show me the power of you, the Runedragons,” said Xuan Huang in excitement. There was a subtle contradiction in his words, yet Qing Gui was too angry to notice that, only wanting to vent all the burning rage and hatred inside him.

        Concentrating the elemental power onto his claws, Qing Gui attacked Xuan Huang madly in desperation. In the face of such overpowering attacks, Xuan Huang was completely suppressed and all he could do was just block and avoid while the wounds on his body kept increasing.

        With a bang, Qing Gui made a downthrust and knocked Xuan Huang flying into a dense wood. That was such a crushing blow that it left a hole in the hard ground.

        Xuan Huang wanted to crawl out of the hole, but Qing Gui gave him no time to do so—he dove at Xuan Huang again and pressed his back to the hole with his claws. Although Qing Gui’s burning rage slightly subsided after launching a series of attacks, the hatred in his eyes still remained implacable.

        “Xuan Huang, for your impenitence, I shall place justice above family royalty and kill you today to atone for those innocent lives you’ve taken,” said Qing Gui ruthlessly.

        “Hahaha…” Xuan Huang started laughing as if he did not know what fear was even though he was on the verge of death. With a mysterious oddity in his laughter, he said, “You the Runedragons are just as powerful as I expected.”

        “You the Runedragons? Why would Xuan Huang talk like that… Now as I recall, he has been acting strange this whole time. It doesn’t seem like Xuan Huang at all… Wait! Could it be that——”

        “You… You’re not Xuan Huang!” Qing Gui shouted in a low voice, in complete stupefaction.

        “You finally got it right, but it’s too late.” Letting out a long howl, Xuan Huang charged at Qing Gui.

        Qing Gui, who did not expect that Xuan Huang would have such strength left, was forced to take a few steps back. Suddenly, a few straps of dark shadow wrapped his body before he could even balance himself!

        “This is… the dragon rein!” Qing Gui looked around only to find several Taoist priests emerged in the woods, channeling their powers into the dragon rein and restraining him with it.

        “Let go of me!” Qing Gui struggled as hard as possible, yet all his attempts went in vain with his powers constrained by the dragon rein, so he could only glare at “Xuan Huang” and question it loudly, “Who are you? What did you do to Xuan Huang?!”

        “You’re originally in no position to question me, but that’s alright. It’s my happy day today, so I’ll gladly tell you.” Xuan Huang grinned as if to show him a smile, and said, “My name is Ying Zheng, and I’m the king who is going to rule all the humans and Runedragons.”

        “Ha, you’re ridiculously delusional!”

        “Soon you’ll know that I’m not delusional.” As Ying Zheng shifted his gaze to one of the priests, he gave a command emotionlessly, “Get him into the bottle.”

        “Yes.” After responding to Ying Zheng respectfully, the priest took out a white bottle—it was the same bottle that Ying Zheng used to trap Xuan Huang back then. Just when the priest was about to cast the spell, a shout suddenly sounded.

        “Stop!” In a distance, a beam of purple light soared into the sky following the shout.

        Then, countless rays of purple light darted out of the light beam at the Taoist priests on the cliff, knocking every one of them down. Qing Gui regained his freedom as the dragon rein that suppressed him just now all loosened and fell to the ground.

        “Qing Gui! Are you alright?”

        “Heshi!” Qing Gui looked at that human flying out of the light beam slowly in surprise—it was Heshi, who was supposed to be dead after the fall. Yet now, he was flying with a pair of wings made of purple light on his back and a dragon phantom behind him.

        “How come you’re still alive…” Ying Zheng recognized the dragon shadow behind Heshi was Xuan Huang, who had been annexed by him.

        “How can I die before I kill you! I’m gonna take you to hell even though there is only a piece of my soul left!” shouted Xuan Huang, his voice filled with smoldering resentment.

        “Since I can annex you once, I can certainly do it again!” Ying Zheng abruptly flapped his wings and charged at Heshi like a thunderbolt, opening his dragon mouth.

        For it happened all of a sudden, Heshi was not yet ready for the attack so he could only watch as the dragon pressed on him to a distance where he could feel the scorching breath of Ying Zheng——

        Bang! A black shadow hit Ying Zheng and stopped his attacks.

        “Don’t you dare!” Qing Gui, who had quickly recovered, grabbed and dragged Ying Zheng with his sharp claws, leaving a deep trail on the ground. Then he pressed down the latter.

        “What a fool!” Yet, it did not throw Ying Zheng into a panic—instead, Ying Zheng conjured his power to split his head into four in a second and bit Qing Gui’s body!

        As the pain forced Qing Gui to let go of his claws, Ying Zheng took the opportunity to flap his wings and fly into the air. Undoubtedly, Qing Gui chased after him. In a split second, the emerald dragon and the purple dragon started a fierce war in the sky where they fought neck and neck with wounds appearing on their bodies one after another.

        Seeing the two locked in a stalemate, Heshi became desperately anxious that he asked Xuan Huang directly without courtesy, “Hey, Qing Gui will be seriously injured if they continue like this. Do you have another way to break this situation?”

        “Tut! Don’t push your luck! I’m just a piece of soul. Besides, I’ve already used much of my power to save you just now——”

        “Then use my power! I’ll do anything as long as it can help Qing Gui!”

        “You… Okay, I’ll think of something else.” Moved by Heshi’s fearlessness, Xuan Huang started looking for a solution. His mouth turned up when he caught a glimpse of something on the ground, then he said, “I’ve got it.”


        While Xuan Huang and Heshi were discussing the solution, the raging war in the sky was still going on—Qing Gui opened his mouth and bit Ying Zheng’s wing, which unfortunately did not put the purple dragon at a disadvantage. Ying Zheng immediately struck back with his claws cutting through Qing Gui’s flank. Blood immediately gushed out from Qing Gui’s body, leaving him no choice but to open his mouth and recoil.

        Just when Qing Gui was about to mount another raid, a beam of silver light rose from underneath and wrapped around Ying Zheng’s body. Ying Zheng struggled to find that he could barely move for his strength was sapped.

        “How does it feel like being caught by your own trap? Ying Zheng.” The voice of Xuan Huang sounded, accompanied by Heshi, who had flown to mid-air while the two dragons were fighting with undivided attention. In Heshi’s hand was the dragon rein that the priests had used to restrain Qing Gui, only that it was now soaked in Heshi’s blood. Since Xuan Huang did not have enough power to activate the rein, they could forcibly activate it with human blood.

        “You can’t trap me with that!” Refusing to admit his defeat, Ying Zheng violently struggled. The shining silver light on the rein suddenly dimmed.

        “Hmm! Qing Gui! Hurry up! I-I can’t hold any longer!” As Heshi shouted, Qing Gui immediately concentrated. A light as green as a jade emerged on his claws and turned into sharp blades.

        With a vigorous flap of his wings, Qing Gui ascended to the upper air, then he abruptly swooped down with all his power concentrating on his claws while aiming at the struggling Ying Zheng——

        Swoosh! The viridian sharp claws ripped through Ying Zheng’s throat; blood poured out like a waterfall. Ying Zheng’s body gradually turned numb, yet he still did not give up—he held out his claws towards the sky,  his dragon eyes widened and filled with bitter resentment.

        “I… I’m not gonna die… I have to rule the world… I’m…” So Ying Zheng breathed his last, with all his unfulfilled ambitions and desires.

        “We-we won… That’s great——Mmm!” Seeing Heshi pass out from exhaustion, Qing Gui hurriedly flew over to catch him, and then slowly carried him back to the ground.

        After Qing Gui turned back to his human form and let Heshi rest next to a tree, he stood up and looked at that flake of Xuan Huang’s soul, which looked more translucent than before as though it would shatter if someone touched it.

        “He’s fine. The scale that he grabbed during the fall has a flake of my soul on it. I borrowed his body after finding that his physique was compatible with Runedragons. He shall recover soon after a period of recuperation.”

        “Xuan Huang, what was going on with you and that man called Ying Zheng?”

        “Nothing. It’s just that I used him and got backfired. I did it to myself. Now since I have got my revenge, I have no regrets. It’s just a pity that I cannot see Bai Hu again… Take care of Bai Hu for me, Qing Gui.”

        “I don’t need you to remind me. Of course, I’ll look after everyone in our clan.” Qing Gui looked at Xuan Huang with mixed feelings. Despite all the wrongdoings of Xuan Huang, he was still one of his family whom he could not help feeling sad for his impending demise.

        “Right, for that earnest personality you have, you sure will burden yourself with all the troubles and responsibilities.” Giving Qing Gui a grin, Xuan Huang said, “Goodbye then.”

        Qing Gui watched as that flake of Xuan Huang’s soul turned into flickers of light and disappeared in the air. Overwhelmed by mixed feelings, he stood still like a statue that had lost his breath until a sense of warmth came up from his hands hanging against his sides—someone was holding his hands.

        “Qing Gui.” Heshi, who had woken sometime earlier, walked to the side of Qing Gui and held his hands tightly as if an offer of comfort. Then, he said in a gentle voice, “Let’s go home.”

        “Sure,” Qing Gui responded softly. Together, he and Heshi made their way home…</p>
