        <h1>The Living Magna - Cthugha</h1>
        <p>        As waves of heat soared with heavy smoke rising into the sky, a summer resort burned vigorously.  The doors and windows were spelled shut, trapping the servants in the inferno until all of them were reduced to ashes.

        Outside the resort was a group of noblemen who watched the heretics and demons stand in a circle around the building while muttering a strange prayer…

        Boom!

        As the house collapsed in the fire, the heretics enveloped the elements in the flames using the servants’ souls

        ‘Come!  My lord!  Here is, the food, we prepared, for you!’ A red monster shouted reverently. His rasping voice was filled with feverish excitement.

        Suddenly, a wave of ominous purple breath emerged and stained the crimson flames black, sweeping through the resort like a dark ocean. The azure sky darkened in an instant, followed by a bolt of lightning breaking through the clouds and creating an eerie magenta vortex.

        A black shadow slowly descended from the vortex. Its body was so enormous that its shadow shrouded everyone around the resort.

        Everyone was trembling in fear. Strangely, they all felt a sudden desire to take a look at the black shadow.

        Sensing the danger, the nobles followed their survival instinct despite their desire for great power. They bit their lips until they bled to suppress the overwhelming desire with the pain. Then they rode away embarrassingly from the sunken resort in the ocean of flames.

        On the other hand, the heretics and demons who worshiped ancient power succumbed to their desire for the unknown. They could not help but raise their heads to look at the mysterious creature hanging in the sky.

        It was a mammoth fiery egg that was covered with thousands of purple fireballs. Besides the unsightly orange blotches that mottled its dark surface, there were great columns of uncanny flames that arced around its rim.

        On the bottom of the flaming egg were countless tentacles of plasma. Pulsating slowly, they absorbed the elements and souls nearby so that the egg could hatch in flames. That was how Cthugha, the Burning One, revealed itself in another world.

        Boom! Boom! Boom! Soon, a series of explosion noises sounded. All the heretics and demons who had taken a look at Cthugha died in a second as their body exploded due to the unbearable pressure that came from the inconceivable manifestation. Their blood stained the ground with crimson.

        Yet, there was still one who managed to maintain his consciousness—it was the red monster. By then, half of his body had already exploded. His head was the only part of his body that still retained its shape. Even so, he kept gazing intently upon Cthugha as it slowly descended as if he could not feel any pain.

        “Oh… So this is my lord… How majestic and sacred… Even my words of praise are blasphemy against him…”

        Perhaps the red monster’s gaze was too passionate—Cthugha finally lowered its head to look at the insignificant creature that it usually would not lay its eyes on. Its gaze intensified the erosion in the monster’s body. Most of the monster’s flesh had been melted, except for one of his eyes.

        However, even that did not stop the monster from admiring Cthugha. Stretching out his right hand which had been reduced to bones, he murmured enthusiastically, ‘My… My lord of eternal flames… Thank you- Thank you for looking down at me… Please use me… use my flesh and blood to nourish your flames…’

        Even though Cthugha could not comprehend the intense emotions of such an insignificant creature, it liked the blazing fire inside his heart, so it decided to keep it burning—a purple fireball separated from Cthugha and wormed into the monster’s body.

        As the monster found his body filled with energy, his damaged flesh and nerves began to rebuild in a warm flame. It only took a while for the monster to gain a new body that was even stronger than before.

        Later, Cthugha and the reborn monster went to a volcano where abundant fire elements lay. After they stored enough power, it took on a new appearance that was close to the primordial dragons and met Agatha, the maiden of the sacred rites…</p>
