        <h1>Lord of R'lyeh - Cthulhu</h1>
        <p>
                “Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn......”

        The priests stood in a circle.  They had set up an altar in front of the gate engraved with the emblem of Cthulhu.  However, what they were standing on was not the ground, but the walls of fallen buildings.  Surrounding the priests were buildings tilted with impossible angles, connecting with each other and even blocking the sky.  Standing close to each other on a small platform, the priests articulated incomprehensible labials, and vibrations were coming up from underwater off and on.

        “That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die. ” The leaders chanted.

        All of a sudden, waves appeared above the city.  When the screens of water were about to fall on to the priests’ heads.  The waves were splited by the tilted towers, so that water was poured onto the houses surrounding the altar.

        “In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming!”

        In the fearsome tides came some fat tentacles, which wrapped and rolled the priests away.  Despite that, the priests continued praying, until every single of them were swallowed by the tentacles.

        Cthulhu had been sleeping in R’lyeh, but R’lyeh was everywhere - on the back of Dagon, under the feets of his believers... The shaky world, overflowed with elements, was a warm bed for the Elder God.  Cthulhu immersed itself inside numerous dreams and the kaleidoscope.  It did not want to be awaken.  However, no matter how many believers he gulped down, there were still be zealous ones who dared calling Cthulhu’s name.  As a result, Cthulhu buried itself in deeper dreams, and melted its consciousness into the bed of the world.  Its body was torn into countless pieces and became the Dwellers of the Sea.  Only a few enormous pieces inherited its name, engulfing its faithful believers in R’lyeh...</p>
