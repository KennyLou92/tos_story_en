        <h1>Mother of All Worlds Benzaiten</h1>
        <p>
        A cheerful and energetic goddess known for her great love of music and unflappable personality.
One day, after awakening to her true form as the goddess of music, Benzaiten heard a mysterious screeching sound that led her to a mysterious star. The noise seemed to have an effect on gravity, pulling in nearby stars. Realizing that if nothing is done, stars would collide and put the fate of the universe in jeopardy, Benzaiten followed the sound to its source and discovered that the star was once among the brightest in the universe. However, the star realized its end was near and emitted a distorted lament in an attempt to bring back the life it once sustained. Sensing the star's sorrow, Benzaiten played a dirge to show that it was not alone. Benzaiten's melody and the star's wailing combined to create a touching requiem that helped the star accept its fate with dignity.</p>
