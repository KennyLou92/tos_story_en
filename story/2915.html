        <h1>Realms of Existence - Shiva</h1>
        <p>Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.8

        With the help of other villagers, Shiva narrowly escaped the massacre when Varuna, the king of Sinha, invaded their village near a coast. During Shiva’s escape, he encountered Parvati, a disciple of Rahmin, a sect that practiced the Chakra Theory.

        In a bid to break through the encirclement of the Sinha army, Shiva unleashed the power of his seven chakras. Although he managed to defeat all their pursuers, the overexertion of chakras plunged his mind into turmoil. Parvati had no choice but to take him with her and attempted to restore his sanity. In the face of adversity, a deep bond formed between them and eventually blossomed into love.

        However, as Parvati and Shiva continued to search for her senior apprentice, Brahma, they were discovered by Varuna’s right-hand man, Agni, who took Parvati hostage and used her life as leverage. Reluctantly, Shiva surrendered and agreed to his demand. Agni took him back to Sinha and imprisoned him in a dungeon inside the palace. There he awakened a new ability—the manipulation of shadows—just before the revengeful Varuna was about to give him the final blow.

        The predator became the prey; Varuna met his demise, delivered by the very imprisoner he had despised who turned the tables by sending a torrent of shadows into his body.

        “Phew, I’m finally back on the ground… Huh? Why is it so dark here?” The moment Shiva walked out of the dungeon, he was stunned by the unusual phenomenon in the heavens.

        Hanging high in the sky were two blazes of scarlet light: one of black hue and one of white hue. The black blaze on the left exuded an intense and ominous dark aura, reminiscent of the dark force Shiva had witnessed within Varuna. It continued to expand, several times larger than the white-hued one on the right which was on the brink of being eclipsed, a spectacle that greatly rattled Shiva.

        “Shiva!” A pleasant female voice called out to Shiva from afar.

        “Parvati!” Shiva exclaimed with joy upon seeing his lover, Parvati. He eagerly rushed forward, opening his arms to hug her.

        “You’re hurt…”  Parvati gently touched the wounds on Shiva’s skin, her heart aching with regret.

        “They’re just flesh wounds. A kiss from you will heal them all,” Shiva teased playfully, winking at Parvati, who responded with a soft grunt, “You—  Stop it!”

        Boom!

        A deafening crash of thunder resounded. A colossal bolt of lightning followed and split the heavens in half, startling the couple locked in a passionate embrace.

        “What is happening? Why is one of the blazes growing? …Did Brahma cause it?” Parvati gazed worriedly at the expanding black blaze in the sky, a foreboding sense creeping up on her.

        ‘Come… The child of destiny… Come to the place where fates intertwine… Fulfill your mission…’ The voice that Shiva had heard in moments of peril resonated in his mind again. It was a moment of revelation: he sensed the trajectory of destiny. Two lotus patterns appeared in his eyes, giving him a divine aura.

        “I have to go,” Shiva said determinedly, “There is something that only I can accomplish.”

        “I’ll go with you,” Parvati nodded. Holding hands, the two hurried toward the forest where a beam of light connected to the black-hued blaze. There they saw a man standing in the middle of a mandala, a magic circle formed in sanskrit.

        “Vishnu!” Parvati recognized the man, Vishnu, her senior apprentice who had long left Rahmin. Yet, he appeared lifeless, his chest devoid of breath. Parvati, unable to conceal her sorrow, asked, “Is he... dead?”

        “No… He’s still alive. He has entered purusha; his soul has transcended the physical form and reached the higher realm,” Shiva explained, the lotus patterning swirling in his eyes as he perceived the essence of all things.

        Shiva saw a beam of white light soaring from the center of Vishnu’s body, extending directly toward the white blaze in the sky. It was the beam of light that supported the white blaze and prevented it from being completely engulfed by the black blaze.

        However, Vishnu’s power alone was not enough to turn the tide. Vishnu's consciousness began to falter as time passed, causing the balance of forces to shift, and the white blaze would eventually be eclipsed.

        ‘I must stop it.’ Shiva understood his mission. Lifting his left knee, he put his left arm around his waist while balancing only on the tip of his root foot. His warm prana began to course through his body and opened all his seven chakras, each emitting an iridescent radiance that coalesced into a beam of pure white light, soaring toward the center of the two blazes as his soul ascended toward the sky.

        In his transcendental vision, Shiva witnessed a man formed of black mist locked in a struggle with Vishnu, his figure composed of white light.

        ‘That’s the man who attacked me when I sneaked into the palace… So he must be Parvati’s senior apprentice, Brahma, the culprit behind the growing black blaze!’

        “Vishnu, give up. You alone can’t stand against the negative energy released by the people in Sinha,” Brahma declared with an arrogant and domineering tone as he extended a massive palm toward Vishnu, who raised his arms in defense. Despite the significant gap in power, Vishnu did not yield. Instead, he vehemently retorted, “No, I believe in the goodness of humanity, just like Lakshmi. We are all born with love and gratitude.” 

        “Naive! This world is full of suffering and it should not exist! Total destruction is the only way to redeem everyone!”

        “Destruction only brings despair. Only through protection can the world be saved!”

        “Tut! What a stubborn fool! Since you insist on standing in my way, I shall eliminate you first!”

        Brahma manifested another massive hand from the black mist and seized Vishnu. He pulled him close, glaring at him with eyes even wider than Vishnu’s, saying, “Perish!”

        However, someone swooped in and sliced off the massive hand with a blade made of the power of protection, freeing Vishnu from Brahma’s grasp.

        “You’re the man with Parvati…”

        “Now is not the time for chit-chat. I will subdue Brahma!”

        Without giving Vishnu a second to speak, Shiva charged toward Brahma, who raised an eyebrow as he looked down at Shiva’s diminutive figure. He disdainfully remarked, “What a fool.”

        Brahma conjured multiple arrows with the power of destruction, but they melted away before they could reach Shiva. In an unexpected turn of events, Shiva subdued him.

        “How?! You just used the power of protection, how did you manage to use the power of destruction?” Brahma asked in astonishment.

        “Protection and destruction are interdependent, so, of course, I can use both of these powers!” While Shiva spoke, he made it to the front of Brahma. With a push of his feet, he leaped onto Brahma’s illusory form, his hands forming intricate seals. The dark forces around Brahma began to flow to Shiva’s left while another surge of white energy flowed from Vishnu toward him.
　
        “No… Don’t take away my power… I’m going to use it to destroy the world, to save it!” Brahma roared in anger.

        “You’re wrong. The world is bound by its own thread of fate; it is not for us to change its course. It is best for these powers to return to the earth,” Shiva closed his eyes. With all his chakras opened, he transcended into the realm of anātman, where he glimpsed the tapestry of the stars and connected to nature.

        And then he saw—

        He saw the twisted thread of causality entwined with the two blazes, a deviation from the course of destiny that had filled the world with suffering and now was the opportune moment to sever the misplaced shackles.

        Concentrating the powers of destruction and creation in his hands, Shiva conjured a sword. He took aim at the entangled thread of causality and swung it—

        Swish! Swish!

        As the thread was severed, the two blazes, disconnected from the world’s fate, began to pulsate vigorously. The fluctuation of their powers affected the manifested reality: winds blew, the earth trembled, and the world was as though on the brink of collapse. Then, the two blazes fell from the sky toward the distant horizon, painting the clouds with a crimson hue.

        “Shiva!” Parvati called out in excitement as she saw Shiva’s lashes flutter.

        “I… I’m okay.” After reassuring Parvati, Shiva turned to Vishnu, who was also slowly coming out of the spiritual realm. Yet, he needed more time to fully awaken for his prolonged stop in the transcendent realm.

        “The sky is blue…” Shiva lifted his gaze towards the horizon where the two blazes of scarlet light had been replaced by a clear azure expanse—a color that teemed with vitality.

        “Yeah, we can finally look up at the sky again…” Parvati murmured in awe, nestling against Shiva’s shoulder. Together they admired the beautiful heavens.

        Life and death are both parts of the world. Do not deny or reject them. Embrace the present. Let the chakras within you spin in harmony. Be grateful for every moment of joy and each hardship you face for they sculpt each and every part of yourself.</p>
