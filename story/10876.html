        <h1>Operatic Tunesmith - Schubert</h1>
        <p>
                According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        From the moment of the Consonias’ birth, music had been everything to them; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        In the heart of the bustling capital, Groove, surrounded by blooming flowers, stood the Consonias’ greatest pride: the Saint Fleur Music Auditorium, a magnificent building known among the seven races for its outstretched structure that resembled a bird in flight. For its architectural and cultural significance, it was listed as one of the world heritage sites.

        On one particular day, a young Consonia—a twelve-year-old girl—performed in the grand hall of the auditorium. A beautiful and tender melody flowed from the instrument in her hands and resonated throughout the cavernous hall. Within her music was a subtle yet undeniable power. Magically, as it spread across the hall and reached the female statue standing at the center, green leaves began to sprout around the statue, scaling its surface with a speed that defied nature.

        The girl, playing the Song of Vitality, had awakened the dormant life around her and induced a vibrant bloom. It was a unique power bestowed upon the Consonias since their birth—they could infuse their emotions and powers into music, shaping the world and bending its natural laws.

        “You may stop now, Schubert,” A man’s voice came from the audience gallery. It belonged to a man donned in an impeccable suit—the principal conductor of the Court of Music, Bach.

        “Yes, Maestro Bach,” The girl, Schubert, replied. She stopped her performance and stood quietly, waiting for Bach’s instruction.

        Bach observed the changes in the statue, deep in thought. After a moment, he looked up and said, “Schubert, you’ve passed the test. You’re qualified to become a melodist.”

        All Consonias began their study of music from the moment of sentience. When they turned eight to twelve, everyone had to do an audition that would determine their life’s path.

        Each Consonia had to perform before the sacred statue of music, and based on their performance and the changes in the statue, their fate would be decided: whether they would become a melodist, responsible for performing music; a tunesmith, tasked with harmonizing melodies; an instrument maker, crafting tools of music; or a reject of music, living by supporting the Court of Music from the shadows.

        Schubert had been given her dream title—she could become a melodist. However, she felt no joy. Instead, she felt an inexplicable sense of confusion because she had not found her purpose in music

        As if noticing her hesitation, Bach spoke again, “But you’ve only scraped through the test. While you do have some talent in music, there are many melodists who are far more gifted than you. Based on your performance just now, you’ll simply become one of the forgotten on stage unless you work twice or even three times harder than the others. So, my advice to you is to take this decision carefully. Perhaps becoming a tunesmith would be a better choice for you.”

        “...Thank you. I’ll think about it.” Schubert was not surprised by Bach’s remarks. She was well aware of her place—a mediocre musician who possessed some kind of musical gift; but her gift was merely ordinary in the eyes of those with true talents. Sometimes, such mediocrity could be more painful than having no talent at all— 

        —because false hope could be much worse and cruel than complete despair.

        Schubert bowed to Bach before leaving the auditorium. The weight in her chest lightened a little as she stepped outside and gazed at the distant horizon.

        ‘Maestro Bach is right. I’d rather help the others than compete with them. I’ve never understood why we always have to remain competitive during performance. Perhaps becoming a tunesmith and helping the others just suit me better…’

        “Waaaaah!” Suddenly, a piercing cry interrupted Schubert’s thought. Sheets of musical scores rained from the sky. She looked ahead only to see a girl, younger than herself, sprawled awkwardly on the ground.

        “Are you alright?” She hurried over and asked with concern. However, the girl was too overwhelmed by her mishap to respond. Sitting on the ground, she wailed loudly, “Waaaah… It hurts… I was on my way to the audition, and I fell! How useless I’m… Waaah…”

        “She’s not listening… I need to calm her down first…” Schubert decisively summoned her instrument and began to play.

        A gentle and soothing tune flowed in the air, offering the crying girl a comforting embrace. The melody brushed away her pain and made her momentarily forget her sorrow. When the final note faded, the girl looked up at Schubert in awe.

        Clapping enthusiastically, she exclaimed, “That was amazing! You must be an excellent melodist!”

        “No, I’m not,” Schubert said softly, lowering her instrument. A hint of sadness flickered across her face as she shook her head, “I’m not that talented...”

        “How could that be? Your music was so beautiful and colorful! It’s more dazzling than the music I’ve seen from most melodists,” the girl said earnestly.

        “Seen?” Schubert repeated in surprise, but she soon recognized the girl. “So, you must be Beethoven…”

        “Huh? You know me?”

        “Yeah, you’re the music-seeing prodigy who is qualified for the audition at the tender age of eight,” Schubert replied softly. “But you must have been mistaken about me. I just completed my audition, and Maestro Bach said I’ve barely scraped a pass. I’m afraid I’m nothing like you said.”

        “B-but I did see it,” Beethoven insisted. “Your music was so beautiful and gentle. I could feel the love and protection in your melody.”

        “Love and protection…” Schubert murmured. She seemed to have grasped something. “So… I can love and protect people if I become a melodist?”

        “Of course you can! Music heals the soul,” Beethoven said enthusiastically, her eyes sparkling with hope, “That’s why I want to become a melodist who plays songs that comfort those in pain and those unfortunate!”

        “To comfort those in pain and those unfortunate…” Like a ray of sunshine, Beethoven’s words pierced through the fog clouding Schubert’s heart and showed her the path ahead. She had always believed that being a melodist meant constant competition; she had never considered that music could be something else entirely.

        ‘I forgot about all those rules and constraints just now because I was so focused on helping Beethoven, and my true essence showed in the music for the very first time…’ The doubt in Schubert’s eyes was finally lifted, replaced by newfound clarity and determination. She smiled warmly at Beethoven and said, “I want to be that kind of melodist too.”

        Afterward, Schubert chose to become a melodist. She devoted herself to playing music that could ease the world’s pain and sorrow. She even joined Haydn’s orchestra at Beethoven’s invitation, traveling across the realms to aid those in need. Little did she know that she would face the greatest crisis in the history of the Consonias not long after…</p>
