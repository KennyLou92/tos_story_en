        <h1>Devil’s Aria - Paganini</h1>
        <p>
                In a bridal chamber, a man and a woman intertwined with a fiery passion. It was only when the woman gently pushed against the man’s arm that he released her from his embrace. His breath was ragged, thick with desire, as he asked, “What’s wrong?”

        “The ceremony is about to begin,” the woman—the exquisite bride—the conductor of the Rhapsody Orchestra, Paganini, gave a lazy smile as she pushed the man—Schumann, not the groom but a fellow melodist of hers—away.

        “You…” Schumann hesitated, unable to voice the question burning in his mind.

        “Don’t worry. This won’t be the end of us,” said Paganini, who perceptively saw through his thoughts.

        “That’s a relief!” Schumann’s face brightened. He planted a light kiss on the corner of Paganini’s eye before he sincerely wished her well, “I hope you and Haydn find happiness together.”

        “Thank you,” Paganini graciously accepted his blessing with a radiant smile.

        Not long after Schumann left, there was a knock at the door. Paganini raised an eyebrow in surprise. She opened the door only to find an elegantly dressed woman standing there. It was Wieck, Schumann’s wife, whose face bore a note of weariness.

        “Wieck?”  Paganini asked in surprise. “What are you doing here?”

        “I… I know about you and Schumann…” Wieck paused as if she was disgusted by her own words. She stared at Paganini, her eyes filled with anger and resentment as she continued, “And here you are marrying Haydn today? You don’t even love him.”

        “I don’t love Haydn you said?” Paganini chuckled, “Oh dear, no one in this world loves him more than I do.”

        “Then why did you seduce Schumann?” Wieck asked in disbelief, her question almost like a shout.

        “I did it precisely because I love Haydn,” Paganini replied firmly. “And Schumann loves you too. But at the same time, he is a sentimental man full of love. It is in his nature, and if you can’t accept this part of him, you will lose the love he has for you one day.

        “You—” Wieck was left speechless by Paganini’s reasoning. Yet, Paganini had no interest nor patience to continue the conversation. She brushed past Wieck and made her way to the wedding venue.

        There she saw Haydn standing at the end of the aisle, waiting for his bride. Clad in an immaculate suit, he looked even more charming and commanding than usual, a sight that made Paganini’s heart flutter, a mesmerizing moment even. It was not until he gently took her hand that she redirected her focus to their wedding.

        “You look stunning today,” she said.

        “And you are beautiful,” Haydn replied with a tender smile. His eyes brimmed with love as he affectionately lifted his hand to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear. However, his hand suddenly froze in mid-air.

        “What is it?” Paganini asked softly, sensing his hesitation. Then she remembered—Schumann had planted a kiss on her neck in the bridal chamber earlier, and she instantly understood what had caused Haydn’s pause.

        “Oh, that’s probably a mosquito bite,” Paganini said with a smile. Her tone sounded perfectly natural, so convincing that no one would doubt her words. However, she knew deeply that Haydn would not believe her—even though he hid it well, she still caught that faint flicker of anger in his eyes.

        Unfortunately, there was no time for Haydn to unleash his wrath—the ceremony was about to begin.

        Theatrical melodies filled the air as the romantic sound of strings and pipe organs echoed through the dreamlike garden. To the guests’ warm applause, Haydn walked hand in hand to stand before the officiant.

        What is love?

        “Haydn, do you take Paganini as your wife? To cherish her in wealth or poverty, in sickness or health, in sorrow or joy, to love her faithfully for the rest of your life?”

        “…I do.”

        Is it eternal faithfulness? Or selfless sacrifice?

        Who can define it?

        “Paganini, do you take Haydn as your husband? To cherish him in wealth or poverty, in sickness or health, in sorrow or joy, to love him faithfully for the rest of your life?”

        “I do.”

        [i]I know Haydn better than anyone in this world. I know what he truly desires, so I will willingly jump into the abyss for him, to fulfill his vision, even if it means destroying myself.[/i]

        [i]Perhaps no one will ever understand my love for him, but I don’t regret my decision to be the source of his inspiration—which is something far more eternal than any expression of “love.”[/i]

        “And now, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may begin your destined duet.”

        After the officiant’s declaration, Paganini and Haydn summoned their instruments. With their eyes locking on each other, they began to play in perfect unison. Their melodies intertwined, flowing in a seamless and passionate harmony.

        As Paganini watched Haydn immersed completely in their performance, the fiery love in her eyes burned even brighter.

        [i]‘And this is my one-of-a-kind love for you, Haydn.’[/i]</p>
