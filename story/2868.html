        <h1>Sempiternal Ties - Li Tieguai</h1>
        <p>
                One morning, Li Tieguai followed his usual routine and went to the backyard to hang out with Xiao Hei, his beloved black cat, as soon as he woke up. However, he found his cat in a dark figure’s arms as he stepped into the backyard.

        “Muhahaha! Your Devilish Feline of Immortality shall now be mine!” said the figure—a man wearing a horrifying devil mask, with an uproarious laugh.

        “Uh… What are you doing? Brother—” Despite the mask on the man’s face, Li Tieguai still recognized him immediately. However, the man hurriedly interrupted him before he said another word, saying, “No! I am the lord of the void of darkness!”

        An awkward silence fell over the backyard for a while until Li Tieguai’s eyes gradually lit up with excitement.

        “You-you’re saying you’re the lord of the void of darkness?!” asked Li Tieguai in a tone that resembled that of a child who had just received a new toy.

        “Yes! You got it right! I am the lord of the void of darkness! I’m taking your mythical beast and using it as a sacrificial offering to summon the great king of the underworld!”

        “No, you’re already the great king of the underworld,” Li Tieguai corrected the man in a serious manner.

        “...Tut! For goodness’ sake…” The masked man lowered his head and muttered under his breath, but he soon resumed his noble and cold demeanor as he looked back at Li Tieguai. “You saw through my lies. Indeed, it is not the great king of the underworld that I’m going to summon, but the great evil god! Anyway, if you want to save your mythical beast, go to the top of the Demon-Sealing Pagoda.”

        With a flick of his hand, the masked man threw something toward Li Tieguai’s forehead. Li Tieguai caught it by reflex. When he looked up again, the masked man had already soared into the sky riding his sword, disappearing with the black cat in an instant.

        Instead of chasing after the man, Li Tieguai examined the object that had been thrown at him—it was a paper crane which turned out to be a map as Li Tieguai unfolded it.

        “This is… a map to the Demon-Sealing Pagoda! And it’s actually in the Heavenly Kingdom… Xiao Hei, wait for me. I will definitely come to rescue you! Yahoo!”

        Full of adventurous spirit, Li Tieguai followed the map and arrived at the Demon-Sealing Pagoda. However, his fervor was dampened the moment he saw the pagoda.

        “This is…such a shoddy pagoda…” Li Tieguai murmured as he looked at the crumbling pagoda in front of him.

        Li Tieguai cautiously pushed open the door and tiptoed inside lest he accidentally broke it. Suddenly, a roar echoed through the hall.

        “Li Tieguai! You just walk into our trap! Now let us, the four lords of darkness, teach you a lesson!”

        “One, two, three… Three, two, one…” Li Tieguai counted from left to right and again from right to left, but there number was still the same. Perplexed, he looked up at the three masked figures—two men and one woman—standing before him, and asked, “There are only three of you. Why did you call yourselves the four lords of darkness?”

        “Uh… Yeah, why?” The chubby man who had started the roar turned his head to asked the muscular man next to him. The latter pursed his lips and replied in disdain, “Who knew you couldn’t even count! You fat pig!”

        “Excuse me?! Who was the one that felt too embarrassed to say those lines and forced me to say it?! You schmuck!”

        “You fat pig, who are you calling a schmuck!”

        “That’s it! I, Zhong… the evil lord shall settle a score with you today!” Seeing the chubby man and the muscular man about to start a fight, the woman who had been standing by finally snapped and shouted, “Stop arguing, you two! Don’t forget about our mission! Our mission!”

        “Humph! Since you’re so self-righteous, do it yourself then! I quit!” The chubby man stomped his foot and turned his face away, while the muscular man looked up in the opposite direction, indicating his disinclination as well.

        With no other choice, the woman reluctantly stepped forward.  She stiffly straightened her posture, awkwardly raised her voice, and said, “Haha… We are sent by the lord of dusk! You must defeat us first to reach the top!”

        “It’s not the lord of dusk. It’s the lord of the void of darkness. You got it wrong,” Li Tieguai earnestly corrected the woman’s words, which caused the hubby man and the muscular man to burst into loud laughter.

        Hearing the laughter, the woman glared at them fiercely. Then, a massive white lotus flower appeared from thin air and smashed the two men to the ground.

        “Ouch! My back!”
        “That hurts! You violent woman!”

        The chubby man and the muscular man complained, but the woman simply turned a deaf ear to them. She clapped her hands while approaching Li Tieguai with a smile.

        “Phew, it’s much better now. Now let’s fight,” she said.
　　
        “You wicked lotus demoness, I can’t believe you even hurt your companions! You’re truly ruthless!” Li Tieguai reprimanded the woman.

        “Hmm? What did you call me just now?” As the woman asked, Li Tieguai sensed an intense wrath that he had never felt from the woman.

        “Uh… Well, you white lotus enchantress! How could you hurt your own companions? As an embodiment of justice, I must punish you!”

        “Hmph! That’s more like it,” the woman responded.

        With a shout, the two charged at each other, their fists and feet clashing with tremendous force, creating thunderous sounds and heightening the tension. Meanwhile, the two men trapped beneath the lotus flower watched their fight with relish, wishing they had some snacks to enjoy while they watched.

        After fighting with Li Tieguaifor for a while,  the woman suddenly clutched her chest and fell on one knee.

        “I’ve lost. Ah, indeed, you’re a comrade of justice and a formidable opponent!” the woman said.

        “But I haven’t had enough yet...” Li Tieguai pouted like a child who had not had enough fun. However, his childish response failed to move the cold heart of the white lotus enchantress.

        “I said I lost!” said the woman who snapped and glared at Li Tieguai, forcing the latter to let her go. Then, Li Tieguai turned around and ascended the stairs leading to the top of the tower.

        On the top of the tower stood a masked man holding a sword, accompanied by Xiao Hei, licking its fur nonchalantly.

        “I didn’t expect you to defeat the four lords of darkness and make it here, Li Tieguai. You are indeed a qualified opponent to me… the dark lord,” said the man.

        “It’s the lord of the void of darkness, Brother,” Li Tieguai corrected, having fully accepted that no one could remember the lord’s name.

        “Right, right… The lord of the void of darkness… No!” The man halted and looked at Li Tieguai in astonishment for a second. “Ahem… So you’ve noticed.”

        “You’re full of flaws and so obvious that I wouldn’t fail to notice, even if I’m not the smartest,” Li Tieguai said, looking at Lü Dongbin, who had taken off his mask. He then asked, “You have refused to join my play many times, what changed your mind today?”

        “That’s because—” Unfortunately, Lü Dongbin could not finish his sentence as his words were interrupted by a sudden intrusion of the Xians. They rushed towards Li Tieguai, shouting in unison, “Happy birthday!”

        “Huh? How did you all know it’s my birthday?” Li Tieguai was puzzled. He could not comprehend how the others figured it out when he did not even know his actual birthday.

        “I asked your brother.” Lü Dongbin’s answer unraveled Li Tieguai’s confusion.

        Not long ago, Li Tieguai’s elder brother, Boge, broke into the Treasure Pagoda in an attempt to steal an artifact to resurrect their deceased mother. It was through collective effort that Li Tieguai and his fellow Xians managed to stop Boge’s plan. Still, the death of his biological mother cast a gloom over Li Tieguai. 

        Seeing Li Tieguai wallowing in grief in bereavement,  Lü Dongbin and the other Xians decided to celebrate his birthday and perform the heroic play that he had always enjoyed.

        However, Lü Dongbin felt embarrassed about revealing their intentions to Li Tieguai. He awkwardly scratched his cheek and changed the topic. “Let’s not talk about that. We’ve prepared a table of food and pastries. Just come and dig in.”
　
        Lü Dongbin pulled Li Tieguai to a corner, where an octagonal table was set, filled with a variety of delicious dishes. Zhang Guolao and Lan Caihe were already seated, waiting for them to join.

        “It’s all because the old woman summoned her white lotus artifact that got us exposed,” Han Xiangzi sneered, only to receive a punch from He Xian’gu.

        “I think it’s because of this shoddy pagoda you built,” He Xian’gu said with a frown.

         “That’s because we had a low budget,” Cao Guojiu calmly stated.

        As usual, Zhongli Quan somehow ended up arguing with Cao Guojiu again. As Li Tieguai watched the bickering immortals, an endless warmth welled up in his heart.

        “Li, what’s wrong?” Lü Dongbin asked.

        “Nothing… I just had a really great time today!” Li Tieguai said with a smile while holding Xiao Hei in his arms. Together, they looked at the playful Xians, none of whom noticed the tears glistening in Li Tieguai’s eyes.

        ‘Mother, I have found my home now,’ he whispered.</p>
