        <h1>March of Happiness - Mendelssohn</h1>
        <p>        “WHY? Was there something wrong with my performance?” A young man’s voice echoed through the side hall of the Saint Fleur Music Auditorium, silencing all the other chattering melodists, including the man’s childhood friend, Mendelssohn.

        There, at the center of everyone’s attention, Liszt stood proud as he defiantly questioned the principal conductor, Bach. His face was flushed with rage. 

        ‘This is bad,’ Mendelssohn thought. She immediately rushed to Liszt’s side, attempting to stop him from embarrassing himself in front of everyone.

        Fortunately, Chopin, the conductor of the Nocturne Orchestra, arrived just in time and stepped in to stop the confrontation. He then escorted Bach out of the hall, leaving Mendelssohn looking at the indignant Liszt with a worried frown

        “Liszt, don’t worry,” Mendelssohn said, trying to comfort him. “I believe Maestro Bach will give you a second chance and let you become a melodist again if you work hard and prove yourself.”

        “And then what? Abandon my style and play the same hollow harmony as everyone else?” Liszt retorted, his tone dripping with sarcasm.

        “What’s so wrong with that?” asked Mendelssohn out of genuine puzzlement. Yet, her question only fueled Liszt’s exasperation.

        He clicked his tongue in frustration and yelled, “Someone like you who settles for mediocrity will never understand! I HATE harmony. What is so great about that harmonized hypocrisy that everyone wants to celebrate? I did NOTHING wrong, and I have nothing to change!” 

        With a sharp sweep of his sleeve, Liszt turned on his heel and stormed off. His cold and biting words gave Mendelssohn a pang of sadness. That evening, she returned home with a heavy heart. She headed straight to her bedroom without having dinner, burying herself in her comfortable bed.

        ‘So… is harmony wrong? Is being like everyone else truly such a bad thing?’ Mendelssohn’s mind began to spin with countless questions.

        However, the more she thought about it, the harder she found it to understand Liszt’s perspective. Frustrated, she let out a long, weary sigh. Just then, a soothing melody flowed from the outside of her bedroom, and someone opened the door—

        It was her parents, playing a joyful tune with instruments in their hands. For Consonias who both had once been melodists themselves, it was their most commonly artistic way to lighten their daughter’s spirit.

        “Papa… Mama…” Mendelssohn whispered, deeply moved by her parents’ heartwarming gesture. Touching the musical sigil on her skin, she summoned her instrument and joined their ensemble number.

        The beautiful melody soothed Mendelssohn’s troubled mind. In the warm embrace of sound, she rediscovered her roots—the harmony that had nurtured her since birth and given her protection as she grew.

        Mendelssohn found her answer in the music.

        “I still don’t think anything is wrong with harmony. It’s indeed something worth celebrating. Liszt must have some kind of misunderstanding. He’d surely know the beauty of harmony if I could talk to him.”

        Optimistic and pure-hearted, Mendelssohn was truly convinced she could help her friend see the beauty of harmony. However, what she failed to realize was how unyielding and radical Liszt’s opposition to the concept of harmony could become…</p>
