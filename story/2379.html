        <h1>Dawn of Civilization - Maya</h1>
        <p>        Since the return of Uinal and villagers who sailed off fishing, everything went well in the village.  Based on Maya’s weather forecast, they hurried farming before the storm and cold wave came, so that the villagers had sufficient grains to survive the winter and trade with other villages.  Gradually, Maya’s village became well-known among the region.  Everyone was talking about a lady who could forecast weather and bring good harvests.

        One day, Uinal came to her residence.  The crops gifted by the villagers had taken up an entire corner of her house.  “Maya, you’ll soon become the person with the most harvests here,” he exclaimed.

        “Everyone is just being nice to me.  I feel like I shouldn’t turn their regards down.” Maya said as she packed up the grains with Uinal’s help.

        “So you won’t turn down anyone being nice to you right?  Do I count?” Uinal looked at her eyes.

        “Of course you’re nice.  I always know it.” Maya smiled to reply.

        Uinal felt shy and turned his face away, finding that there were scratches on the food shelves.  “I haven’t seen these marks before.  You recorded all the grains gifted by the villagers too?  That’s something.”

        Maya smiled and went to the coast after settling down the chores.  Observing the ever-changing waves, she marked a series of symbols on a stone and linked them together into a circle.

        “Not only the weather changes, the flow of the ocean, activities of animals and even our body also exist a cycle…”

        “Are you recording the weather?  So the slash means sunny?” A strange male voice sounded behind.  Maya turned around and saw a slim man and a white-haired lady.

        “You’re?” Maya frowned as she recognized they were from somewhere else just by their attires.

        “He is Dumuzi and I am Inanna from the city.  We hope to seek the way for good harvests,” Inanna spoke gently.

        “The King and Queen?” Maya was shocked to believe they would pay her a visit.

        Food shortage occurred due to poor harvests in the country.  In such regard, King Dumuzi had been searching for a solution.  And they found out that Maya was able to bring a bumper crop, so they paid a visit.

        “It’d be much appreciated if you can help our empire for the sake of humanity.” Dumuzi sensed the potential of Maya, so he believed she must be the savior of the country.

        “I…” Maya somehow thought of Uinal and became hesitant.

        “You shouldn’t limit yourself to this tiny village.  Why not come to our empire to broaden your horizon?” Inanna saw through her hesitation and kept on the persuasion.

        Maya understood she must explore more to realize the cycle of all things in the world.  For the well-being of Uinal and the village, she accepted the invitation. 

        The night before Maya set out, she met Uinal on the shore.

        “Uinal, I’ll be leaving the village for a while.” Maya looked him in the eyes.

        “I’ll communicate with the villagers based on the symbols you left, and look after this place.” Uinal brought her in his arms.  “There’s something I need to tell you when you’re back. For now, just feel free to do what you want to.”

        “Be safe.” Maya hugged Uinal back in the moonlight; their shadows were clinging to each other.

        After coming to the empire with Dumuzi and Inanna, Maya made use of her knowledge about weather to help them secure the best time for harvests by planting appropriate crops in different climates.  Soon, the agricultural activity became well-organized, not just calculating sunrises and sunsets.

        Maya marked symbols on a stele at the center of the city and linked them into a circle, symbolizing a cycle of weather changes.  Since then, people had named it “calendar”. As a result, the harvests of the empire grew ample and stable; and the food shortage was successfully resolved.

        “Thank you Maya.  We would still be bothered by the food crisis if we hadn’t had you.” Holding Maya’s hand, Inanna was gazing at the bustling city on the balcony.

        “Not at all.  I’ve learnt a lot during this time.” Maya looked at the stele, which marked various kinds of human-shape symbols.

        “Maya, can I ask you for another favor,” Inanna spoke woefully.

        She continued as Maya nodded, “I hope you can marry Dumuzi and serve him with me…”

        Then, Inanna cried tears of sorrow.

        “You and Dumuzi love each other so much...Did something happen?” Maya could feel that Inanna did not want it.

        “People have been discussing lately...that I’m unable to carry his baby since we’re together.  A country must have an heir…” Inanna lowered her head to speak disappointedly.

        “I see...can you tell me the last time you had intercourse with him?” Maya picked up a stele.

        “I…” Inanna blushed at the question.

        “Remember when I said everything had its own cycle in the world?” Maya’s hand stopped at a symbol, which was a pregnant human.  Then she made a dot on the stele.

        “Yes. Seems you’ve been studying this lately…” Inanna managed to contain the sob.

        “Sunrise and sunset are not just about weather.  It also represents our body changes.  We need to adjust based on the cycle of the world.” Maya smiled at Inanna.

        “Cycle of the world?”

        “Right, just like the sun and moon, and the tides.  As long as we understand the pattern, we can predict the weather and make the right move.  It’s worth the effort only if you do it on proper days.”

        Then, Maya laid her finger on another human symbol and wore a smile at Inanna.  “The 7th day from now is crucial.” 

        Inanna nodded shyly; the balcony was full of their laughters.

        Days gone.  More and more symbols were marked on the calendar.  Soon it became a necessity in people’s daily life.

        One day, Inanna and Maya took a walk to the giant stele.  Laying Maya’s palm on her own belly, Inanna felt embarrassed to whisper, “Maya, I did it.”

        “Wonderful! Did Dumuzi know?” Maya was excited.  At the moment, Dumuzi just came by.

        “Why are you two here?  The weather is getting cold.  Please take care.” 

        “You’re right.  Now Inanna can’t afford to get sick.” Maya implied, but Dumuzi seemed to be perplexed.  So she put his hand onto Inanna’s belly.

        “Do you understand now?  Get a good name for your baby.”

        “Baby?  Inanna you!” Looking at her blushing face, the calm Dumuzi lighted up.

        “Thanks to Maya…,” Inanna said.

        “Thank you!” Dumuzi held her hands tight as a gratitude.

        “Maya!” 

        Turning around, Maya saw a well-built man covered in dust.  Anxious, he hurried over.

        “Maya, you and the King…” Uinal saw they were holding hands.

        “Uinal, what are you talking about?” Maya was puzzled.

        “Recently, a rumor has been spreading that you and King Dumuzi are marrying, so——”

        “No.”

        “Sorry, I have to break my promise now.  About the things I need to tell you earlier, I can’t wait any longer.” Uinal gazed at her with determined eyes.

        His skin was tanned by long exposure under sunlights.  Therefore, Maya could hardly see his blushing face.  “Please, marry me.”

        “Em...3650.” Maya was unable to contain her smile, which made Uinal at a loss.

        “The marks on the shelf in my house are not about how many grains I have.  It’s the days since we met.  I still keep on recording after I came here.  Today is the 3650th day since our first encounter, my fiance.” Maya’s words had left the most unforgettable mark in Uinal’s heart. </p>
