        <h1>Rocket Explosive - Iggy</h1>
        <p>
                “Oh god! I just locked myself out of the store. This is bad..” York the store owner grumbled.

        Everything was witnessed by Iggy, a teen craftsman, who volunteered to help.

        “Let me get it open for you. I’m Iggy the Door Buster. Even the impenetrable city gate was cracked by me!”

        After a deafening blast, Iggy said proudly, “look! The door is opened.”

        “Nonsense! You've blown up my whole store and I don’t even have a door now! This is my store, not the enemy’s gate! You crazy bomber!” York was furious.

        The displeased Iggy then went to the suburb for a private moment.

        “Crazy bomber, really? I’m an explosive expert! Explosive is the most wonderful thing in this world. It brings smoky sky, soul-shaking noises and pleasant fume smell. Why can’t people understand the beauty of explosives?”

        “I understand.”

        The words came from a smiling traveller who was standing behind Iggy.

        “My name is Sonata. I'm very impressed by your knowledge in explosives when I saw you blow up the door back then. If I may, I’d like to seek help from you.”

        Sonata then filled Iggy in with his background. He had been travelling around the world to find the music score of “Whisper of Monesis”, the lost treasure of his clan. He suspected that a mysterious document inside the vault of the local landlord was the music he had been looking for. 

        Yet when he sneaked into the mansion last night, he was unable to open the thick steel gate. That was why Sonata needed Iggy to blow the gate up for him.

        Iggy laughed.

        “You’re lying, aren’t you?”

        “Huh?”

        “You’d like to be as quiet as possible if you want to steal something. Plus aren’t you afraid that I might break your treasure? You just want me to create a diversion, so that you can search for the music.”

        Sonata lowered his head shamefully.

        “I’m sorry. I lied because the music isn’t in the vault. It’s actually in the landlord’s secret treasure chamber, but I don’t know where that is. That’s why I was trying to use you as a decoy. I’m really sorry, and I guess you don’t wanna take this job. Then I’ll ask another…”

        “Hell no! I take everything as long as it’s explosive-related. Let’s go!” Iggy made the decision quickly.

        At night, Iggy and Sonata successfully sneaked into the landlord’s mansion. Arriving at the vault, Sonata hid behind a cover while Iggy threw his custom bomb at the door. The vault gate was blasted open in just a blink of an eye.

        “Hahaha! I’m a genius...Wait, whoa!”

        Not only had the explosion cracked the vault, but it also broke the building structure, causing the collapse at where Iggy stood.

        “Iggy!” Sonata grabbed Iggy’s hand in time.

        “What are you doing here? Go search for the score!” Iggy yelled.

        “How can I...Whoa!”

        Both Sonata and Iggy dropped into a deep hole as another collapse happened.

        “Where are we…”

        When they got back on their feet, they realized that they weren't in a hole, but a luxurious basement. The landlord’s secret treasure chamber was actually located underground.

        As for the mysterious document, it was sealed inside a hardened glass box.

        “Ugh. It doesn’t crack no matter how hard I smash it!” Sonata was stuck in the current problem.

        “Mind if I blow it up?” Iggy suggested.

        “Wait, no way!” Sonata rejected him immediately.

        “Relax. It was unfortunate to blow up the mansion, but at least I found the perfect explosive ratio.”

        Iggy then stuck certain pieces of explosive-blended clay on the glass box. When the explosives were ready, he ignited the fuse to detonate the clays. Boom! The glass box was shattered while the document remained intact.

        “Amazing!” Sonata rushed over to read the document, and he was disappointed. “Oh...It’s not the music I want.”

        “Aw. What a shame,” Iggy was disappointed too.

        Yet Sonata smiled. 

        “Not really. I’m so delighted to meet a real genius during my journey in searching “Whisper of Monesis”. I guess this is the gift that the great Zana gave me. Guards are coming. Let’s leave!”

        The two then escaped out of the town. It was the time for Sonata to bid Iggy farewell and return to his journey.

        When Sonata was on his way, an explosion caught his attention. Looking up, he saw a colourful firework in the sky, which included the regards from Iggy.

        The firework said, “safe journey.”
