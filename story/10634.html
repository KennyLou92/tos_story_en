        <h1>Sempster of Words - Leon</h1>
        <p>        On Odyssey, the home planet of the Holy Gods—

        The largest auction house in Olympus, the capital city, was strangely bustling with activity since it was the day of the annual auction. With the front entrance swarming with guests from all regions, all the staff was occupied. However, up on the top floor of the auction house, two security guards lounged leisurely. One of them, a bald man, stood by the window while observing the surging throng below.

        “The number of guests today is even more than what we had in the past auctions,” the bald security guard remarked, walking toward the central display platform in the room. On the platform stood a torso mannequin wearing a thin, iridescent brigandine that shimmered with golden and silver hues, tightly sealed in a glass case.

        He lightly tapped on the glass, wearing a faint smile as he asked, “So, this is the special item saved for the last in today’s auction?"

        “Yes. It is a brigandine made from a Tuxia dragon’s bones, combined with various rare materials. Not even the wealthiest nobles can get their hands on one,” answered the other security guard with a scar on his face, leaning against the wall while fiddling with his weapon.

        “If it’s so rare to find, how did our boss manage to get it?” the bald security guard asked.

        “Heh, through some dubious methods, of course—”

        Bang!

        The closed window suddenly swung open, interrupting the scarred-faced security guard’s words and putting both security guards on high alert. The two immediately turned their attention toward the open window and gripped their weapons, assuming fighting stances. However, nothing happened.

        “...Perhaps there was a gust of wind that blew the window open. I’ll go and close it,” the bald security guard said and walked toward the open window. As he reached out to close it, a pair of long legs extended from above, skillfully wrapping around his neck. Before the security guard could react, a man propelled himself through the window with audacious grace, forcefully pushing him backward.

        The impact sent the bald security guard crashing into the wall, rendering him unconscious. It was then that the scarred-faced security guard finally realized the crisis. Just as he pulled out his walkie-talkie to call for backup, the young intruder uttered an enigmatic incantation. All of a sudden, breathing became difficult for the guard, and he could not even utter a sound.

        “That guy has sucked away the air around me… Damn it!” Even though the scarred-faced security guard noticed what the young man had done, he failed to undo his trick but only let the intruder’s swift and powerful punch land on his abdomen and join the bald security guard in unconsciousness.

        “Humph,  ” The young man, named Leon, muttered, dusting off his hands before turning toward the brigandine. Putting a hand on the glass case, he whispered with a nostalgic sentiment filling his voice, “Finally, I’ve found you. Don’t worry, Grandpa. I’ve come to take you home.”

        Then, Leon shattered the case with a short knife and took the brigandine from the mannequin. As he was about to roll it up and place it into a silk pouch, a piercing alarm blared throughout the entire auction house.

        “Tut! I must have triggered the security system. Those bastards may recognize me if I turn back to my dragon form now. It’s best for me to hide until they let their guard down, then make my escape,” Leon swiftly made up his mind, hastening his actions to secure the brigandine. By then, a flurry of footsteps emanated outside the door. It was clear that escaping through the entrance had become impossible. 

        Without hesitation, Leon rushed to the window, stepping deftly onto the windowsill. Just as the security guards pushed open the door and entered, he leaped outward, vanishing from their sight. While his body plummeted from the height of ten floors, the wind whipped against him, causing a slight sensation of pain. Yet, he showed no sign of fear.

        Revering everything that originated from the elements, the Tuxia dragons never feared the forces of nature. It was their piousness that they were bestowed with a special talent: the ability to comprehend the language of the elements. Some of them could even manipulate natural phenomena through their words, and thus they were often called Natusempsters, and Leon was one with extraordinary talent.

        As Leon neared the ground, he spoke the language of the elements, asking the wind to carry his weight and ensure a safe landing. However, he underestimated the security of the auction house—another group of security guards was already waiting to capture him on the ground.

        In a moment of panic, Leon could only sprint up a path leading to the mountain, deliberately running into the dense forest to elude the security guards.

        Although Leon eventually managed to abscond from the guards, he ended up losing his way unintentionally. However, turning back would mean falling into the clutches of the pursuing guards, so he had no option but to keep moving forward. After some while, he finally reached the edge of the forest, Eagerly, he quickened his pace only to witness a stupefying spectacle as he dashed through the woods—

        In a hot spring near the woods, an ethereal figure stood with her back toward Leon amidst the steam. Her golden hair draped over her fair back, cascading along her exquisite silhouette with an unspoken sense of allure.

        Before the woman in the hot spring spoke, Leon immediately turned around, exclaiming frantically, “Oh nooooo! I-I-I didn’t mean to peep on you while you were bathing!”

        A scarlet flush rose to Leon’s face and spread across his entire body, resembling the color of a cooked shrimp. Wisps of white steam seemed to emanate from his overheated head. Overwhelmed with embarrassment, he tried to explain stutteringly, “Th-this, this is just an accident! I— Woah!”

        Midway through his words, Leon felt a surge of intense hostility behind him. With the sense of embarrassment slowing his reflexes, he lurched forward just in time to narrowly evade the sweeping blade of a spear above his head. He then quickly turned around.

        The golden-haired woman, who had been bathing in the hot spring moments ago, was wrapped in a towel with a long spear in her hand. In addition to the tint of rosy hue from the steam, her fair skin now bore a crimson flush brought by anger.

        “Wait, wait! This is a misunderstanding! I came here by accident while escaping the bodyguards’ pursuit! I had no intention to peep on you at all!” Leon explained desperately.

        “Humph! If you weren’t guilty, why did you run then?” Nesoi, the daughter of the Queen of the Holy Gods, had never experienced such humiliation. The fact of being seen naked had provoked a burning rage within her, replacing her usual composed and rational self. She frowned and glared at Leon with fury, demanding, “Enough! Just accept your fate!”

        Raising her spear, Nesoi thrust fiercely toward Leon, who quickly leaped forward and started running. However, Nesoi was determined to make him pay, persistently chasing after him while launching attacks with precision. Leon, knowing he was in the wrong, dared not retaliate and could only take the defensive stance. Still, he knew that playing defense would not solve the problem, so he attempted to reason with her.

        “It’s not like that! I only did it because they took something from me!”

        “Humph! Criminals always find excuses. You can’t fool me!”

        Nesoi remained resolute in not letting Leon off the hook. Despite his evasive maneuvers, he could not hold out for long against her relentless attacks. With each strike of her spear, he winced in pain, his face contorted, and thus he pleaded, “P-please, I beg you. St-stop! I-if you’re so concerned about being seen, I promise to take care of you.”

        “I don’t need a fugitive like you to take care of me!”

        Neosoi’s unwavering stubbornness fueled Leon’s anger. Without careful thinking, he blurted out a spiteful remark, “Tut! Then how can I make it up to you… How about I take off my clothes and then we’ll get even?”

        As soon as the words left his mouth, Leon knew he had made a mistake—his words only intensified Nesoi’s hostility, and her attacks, which had shown some restraint, now carried a distinct surge of magic power. She stood tall on a boulder at the edge of a cliff, her beautiful face emotionless, cold like an ice sculpture, staring ruthlessly at Leon, who had fled below, from her lofty vantage point.

        “I have no interest in seeing your naked body,” Nesoi raised her spear high, ready to strike at Leon, saying, “I was going to give you a chance, but it seems unnecessary… Woah!” However, just as she was about to swing, the towel on her body suddenly unraveled due to her movement.

        Nesoi had no choice but to halt her attack and grab the towel frantically, but due to the slippery rocks moistened by the spring water, she lost her footing and tumbled backward, falling from the cliff.

        “Oh no!” Leon quickly climbed up the rock, attempting to catch Nesoi. Still, he was a step too late. “It’s not the time to worry about being discovered by the guards now. I have to save her!”

        Leon tapped into his magical powers, and under a dazzling display of light, his body grew larger, transforming into a majestic dragon in the blink of an eye. After catching Nesoi in mid-air, he circled for a brief moment and flew back to the cliff’s edge, where they gently landed by the pool. Then, Leon returned to his human form after ensuring Nesoi safely stood on the ground.

        After the precarious accident they had experienced, both Nesoi and Leon finally got the time to calm down. The previous tension between the two dissipated, replaced by an awkward silence.

        It was after a moment of hesitation that Leon gathered his courage and broke the silence. He clarified, “I really didn’t mean to peep earlier—”

        “I know,” Nesoi interrupted. Although she tried to make her voice sound calm, the underlying discomfort was still hard to conceal. “You’re a Tuxia who came for brigandine made from dragon bones, didn’t you?”

        “Huh?” Leon was taken aback at Nesoi’s question, and he asked, “How did you know?”

        “The Tuxia dragons should have no lack of money. Besides, the brigandine is made from the bones of your kind, so it’s unlikely that you would sell it to the merchant.”

        “Yeah, exactly! This brigandine was made from my grandfather’s bones. There’s no way we would sell it.” Leon said begrudgingly, “It was that sneaky merchant who tricked us. We asked him to get us the other materials to make the brigandine, but he set us up with the contract and swindled us out of our brigandine. Unwilling to start an argument, the elders planned to buy the brigandine back at the auction and let the merchant get away, but I couldn’t stand it! It was they who did us dirty, and there’s no reason for us to suffer injustice!”

        “I see, ” Nesoi said with a nod.

        “So…do you believe me now?”

        “Well, at the very least, more than I believe the owner of the auction house,” Nesoi answered with a faint smile, “Don’t worry. This is also the reason why I came here—to investigate this matter, and if what you said is true, I will ensure your innocence.”

        “Really? Then let’s hurry and go—”

        “Wait, let me put some clothes on first,” Nesoi said.

        “Oh… I-I’m sorry.” It was only then that Leon realized that Nesoi was still clad in nothing but a towel. The towel itself was quite small, barely reaching halfway down her thighs, unable to cover her fair shapely legs and  smooth shoulders—

        ‘No, no, no! I gotta stop thinking about that!’ Leon pressed his hands against his head, trying to prevent his thoughts from venturing into the criminal side.

        “What’s wrong?” Nesoi asked in confusion. Leon immediately snapped to attention. Averting his eyes from Nesoi, he stammered, “N-nothing. You go change. I’ll wait for you.”

        He turned around stiffly and walked forward. In his flustered state, he bumped into a tree, emitting a groan of pain as he held his throbbing forehead and crouched down. Nesoi, who witnessed the whole scene, could not help but let out a light amused chuckle—she found him endearingly clumsy for a moment.

        Later, Nesoi, now fully dressed, confronted the owner of the auction house alongside Leon. Faced with the princess’ questioning, the owner finally confessed and agreed to return the brigandine and offer compensation.

        By the time everything was settled, the sun had already set, so Leon and Nesoi left the auction house, walking side by side.

        “Thank you for helping us,” Leon expressed his gratitude. Nesoi shook her head in response, and said, “It was nothing. Besides, I didn’t want this to become the reason for the Tuxia dragons to have a feud with us.”

        “But regardless, It wouldn’t have been easy to retrieve my grandfather’s brigandine without your help, and I do want to thank you personally. Is there anything I can help you with?”

        “Well…” Nesoi pondered for a moment before asking, “Can you turn back into your dragon form and give me a ride in the sky?”

        “No!” Leon firmly refused, saying, “Absolutely not!”

        “Then I guess I’ll just have to ask another dragon later.”

        “No, you can’t! You can’t ride another dragon!” Leon strongly protested.

        “Why not?” Nesoi asked.

        “Um…” Even though Leon himself could not comprehend the sense of unease that arose upon hearing Nesoi’s idea to find another dragon, he still adhered to his thought. “You just can’t! Riding a dragon is not as fun as it sounds. The scales are too hard and you can’t sit comfortably…”

        Leon kept muttering in an attempt to dissuade Nesoi from her idea. Strangely, his earnest persuasion somehow pleased Nesoi, who, at that time, had no idea that it was a sign of love.

        Just like that, the two, one tall and one short, walked side by side under the twilight‘s glow, forming a bond that continued to grow afterward...
