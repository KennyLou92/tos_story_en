        <h1>Van Hohenheim</h1>
        <p>
        Ed and Alâ€™s father. His knowledge and skills in alchemy are exquisite. Like his sons, he has blonde hair and golden eyes, but his appearance for some reason, has not changed at all ever since Pinako was young. He is a difficult man to pin down. He never returned to Resembool once he left his wife Trisha and his sons on a journey over a decade ago, even when Trisha died. Because of that, Ed hates him with a passion.</p>
