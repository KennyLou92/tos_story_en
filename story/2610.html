        <h1>The Final Waiting - Novalis</h1>
        <p>
                In the Enochian Tower, Novalis was busy avoiding the falling rocks; Faugn’s voice wrestled with him. The surging dragon power burst from his body, drowning Novalis' thoughts, and the illusion of elements engulfed his irrational soul…

        Novalis witnessed his parents’ death in the demon’s assault. Since then the surviving Novalis became taciturn. The haze of trauma had been haunting him, until he was sent to his uncle’s house under a cold rainy night.  Sophie, Novalis’ cousin, led him to the fireplace; the warmth from the palm of his hand melted the darkness in Novalis’ heart.

        “Don’t worry. It’s fine. I’m holding your hand.”

        The flames flickering on the girl's gentle eyes made Novalis feel relieved, which slowly dissipated the fear in his heart. He liked this family. They were the only relatives he could rely on. Novalis just wanted to stay with them and led a peaceful life, but the good times were short. One day, they went to visit a monument exhibition. Novalis was invited by the wizards to be the envoy of the Primordial Dragons because he understood Faugn’s stele runes.

        “Life is the beginning of death, which terminates at destruction. Therefore, death is the end and the start——”

        “You’re talented! My son, you’ll become our envoy!”

        Novalis had been assisting his uncle's research, for he was literate in runes on the stele. Therefore, with new breakthroughs achieved in research, more and more people came to listen to his uncle's speech...including the mad wizards. The wizard took a fancy to his uncle's study and came to negotiate many times. Knowing that the visitors were unkind, Novalis hid behind the door with Sophie every time, staring hostilely from the crack of the door.

        “I will never give in my research! It’s our brainchild!”
        “Very well, I’ll make you do it.”
        “Ah——” The wizard did not hesitate to kill in order to obtain the research of the Primordial Dragons. He stretched out his hand to strangle uncle's neck. Sophie rushed over when she saw this, but got hit by witchcraft together. Purple smoke exploded from the room. The scene before him evoked the fear at the bottom of his heart, just like when his parents were killed back then…

        “Don’t! Don’t take everything away from me…”

        “Call upon the power of horror! Defeat him. Crush him. Rip him off!”

        The voice in his heart became the only guide. Novalis' eyes lit up; his lips chanted the stele runes spontaneously. Purple light started to surround him, and the summoned power was casted against the wizard. "This, this is the power of Faugn!" The wizard was knocked down. When Novalis got back his mind, he saw three bodies lying down in the broken home...

        The dying Sophie gently stroked Novalis' face. Novalis held her feeble hands tight. The temperature of the palms was slowly receding. Novalis stood silently by her side, until the fire in Sophie's pupils also went out. In the face of her death, there was a greater voice in his heart calling him other than fear…

        “Follow me. Reborn from horror! I’ll be waiting for you in the end.”

        “I have lost everything...what else can I get from death? What is waiting for me in the end?” Novalis thought blankly. “No, I understand. Death is not just death. The death of my parents in the past brought me to Sophie. At this moment, the death of Sophie and uncle will lead me to another beginning…”

        Novalis sensed Faugn's call from his strength. Now that he had nowhere to go after losing his close relatives, he had no choice but to embark on a journey to find Faugn. When he came to the foot of the mountains where  Ethereal Dragons were located, he saw someone familiar on the beach. The blue-haired maiden with a long horn turned her face. A pair of bright red eyes caught the hesitant heart of Novalis…

        “Fear awakens instinct. Death connects new beginnings. The unknown ahead is waiting for us to explore. Perhaps it is death that makes our encounter.”</p>
