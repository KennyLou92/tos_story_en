        <h1>Navigator of Stars - Ophiuchus</h1>
        <p>
                Just when Summoners were put into a bitter struggle, the Court of Ophiuchus came just in time to shield them away from the battlefield. In the end, with the help of Mitty and Marble, the Canis Major and Minor, Ophiuchus managed to defeat Pontos.

        After the fight, Ophiuchus, Marble and Mitty walked up the stairs wearily where they ran into a man and a woman.  From the overpowering aura of the two, Ophiuchus could tell that they were no ordinary people. Grim-faced, Ophiuchus clenched his hands into fists and slightly bent his body, like a beast that encountered formidable predators.

        “I can’t have another long fight with the injury I got just now. I have to make it quick.” At such thought, Ophiuchus leaped into the air to give the man a thundering punch with all his strength.

        Yet, Ophiuchus’s punch was stopped by an elemental shield. As the man snapped his fingers with a snort, the shield released a beam of scorching fire and blasted Ophiuchus into the distance. Seeing that, Marble and Mitty immediately ran over to catch him.

        ‘You foolish mortal. How dare you defile this sacred land and challenge the might of the God of the Sun!’ The God of the Sun, Apollo, said coldly while looking down at Ophiuchus as if he was looking at something unclean. Then, he raised his bow into the air. A blinding light gathered at the bow riser and gave Ophiuchus a shiver of fear.

        “I have to stop him before he shoots that arrow!”

        Ophiuchus and Mitty simultaneously launched an attack but they failed to notice Artemis, who had already aimed her bow at Ophiuchus behind the light of Apollo. With a flash of silver light, a silver arrow appeared precisely before Ophiuchus’ forehead.

        It was a terrifyingly fast arrow that gave Ophiuchus no time to react. Fortunately, Marble leaped and pushed him away in the nick of time. Yet, the silver arrow hit Marble’s hind leg, causing a splatter of blood on Ophiuchus’ face.

        ‘Marble!’ Ophiuchus screamed. Meanwhile, Mitty rushed to catch Marble. However, Apollo’s attack soon came before they had the time to grieve. Like a shower of rain, a hail of light arrows descended from the sky, so Ophiuchus could only bite down on his resentment and channel his astralist power to conjure phantom snakes over his head as a shield.

        Amid the constant sound of arrows beating against Ophiuchus’ shield, his face grew paler with every second past.

        Blood drained from Ophiuchus’ face. Even so, he did not move a step but kept holding the shield of snakes to protect Mitty and Marble from the rain of light.

        “Why… Why do they always have to take away everything I love…”

        As Artemis aimed her bow at Ophiuchus again, a sense of despair swept through the young man. Just then, Mitty gave Ophiuchus a grin. Even though no words were spoken, Ophiuchus understood what it meant…

        “Mitty! NOOO!”

        With a burst of dazzling light coming out of Mitty’s body, it dashed into the rain of light, targeting the two gods. Countless wounds appeared on Mitty’s body in an instant. Still, it showed no fear. Seeing Mitty, Artemis immediately changed her target.

        When Artemis fired her silver arrow at Mitty, the latter summoned all its astralist power and swung its claws, creating a gigantic thunderbolt that ripped through the rain of light and broke her arrow in an instant. At the same time, Mitty, who had exhausted all his strength, fell to the ground.

        At that moment, the sight of Mitty falling down overlapped with Ophiuchus’s memories of Ellie being injured by Khaos, the old man being slaughtered by the god soldiers, and Marble being shot the arrow. The rage and sorrow inside Ophiuchus eventually erupted, starting a fire in his soul and turning into swirling starlight in his right eye.

        ‘I won’t let you hurt the people I love again!’ Yelling aloud, Ophiuchus flexed his legs and stepped into the path that Mitty had opened for him. As he ran forward, the countless starlight on his body all coalesced into a giant phantom snake that slithered its way to attack the gods with a storm of sand and dust.

        With a frown marring his forehand, Apollo concentrated all his godly power to repel the phantom snake with  Artemis.

        Unexpectedly, the phantom snake broke into pieces easily when the two powers collided, which gave the two gods an ominous feeling. At the same time, a fist fell from the sky and hit the ground, creating a blinding burst of starlight. The blast of wind knocked Apollo and Artemis away, causing them to cough up blood.

        When the two gods got back up and stared at Ophiuchus with blood lust, a majestic voice sounded in Apollo and Artemis’ heads.

        “Come back. Don’t waste your time on ants.”
        “Lord Khaos!” Apollo said respectfully as he recognized the voice. However, he hesitated because of his rage about Ophiuchus.
        “But he——”
        “Don’t make me say it twice.”
        “...Yes.”
　　
        Without any choice but to obey Khaos’ order, Apollo gave Ophiuchus a resentful glare before he and Artemis turned into two streams of light that flew back to the top of the tower.

        Watching the two gods leave, Ophiuchus fell to the ground with a sigh of relief.

        ‘Ophiu, Ophiu…’

        In a haze, Ophiuchus saw Marble and Mitty, who were horribly scarred, walking slowly toward him.

        ‘Thank goodness… You guys are okay…’

        ‘Mitty and I are gonna be fine because we are staying with Ophiuchus forever…’ said Marble.

        ‘Marble, Marble, Mitty, Mitty, Ophiu, Ophiu, forever, together!’

        ‘Yeah…’ Ophiuchus drew Marble and Mitty into his arms and held them tightly yet gingerly with joy as if he had found his lost treasures, and said, ‘The three of us will stay together forever.’</p>
