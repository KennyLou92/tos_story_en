        <h1>Lust</h1>
        <p>
        A mysterious woman who has the tattoo of Uroboros on her chest.

Her true identity is the homunculus of “Lust.”

She has an enchanting appearance and special skills to change her claws into “the strongest halberd” that can pierce through iron.

She can accurately assess the situation and is cold-blooded enough to mercilessly exterminate anything that gets in the way.

She takes command and flies around to various places to execute plans for “Father,” but suffers defeat against Roy during the underground battle at the Third Laboratory.

She is burned away completely along with her core, the Philosopher’s Stone.
