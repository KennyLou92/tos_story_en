        <h1>The Red Hood’s Return - Doris</h1>
        <p>        The three sisters’ lives—Woodbury, Alice and Doris—returned to normal after they defeated Nome, their grandfather: Woodbury, the youngest one, continued to hunt down Nome’s henchmen while Alice, the middle one, stayed in Wonderland and Doris, the eldest one, embarked on a new journey.

        On a winter day, Doris was walking through a vast forest with her pet dog, Toto, which began to dash forward in wild excitement.

        “Toto! Wait!” Seeing that, Doris immediately halted Toto. With a stern look, she looked at it and said, “It’s dangerous here so don’t stray too far from me, okay?”

        “Woof!” Toto ran back to Doris after responding with an obedient bark. Unexpectedly, a ball of blinding light suddenly appeared in the sky and stunned Toto.

        “Whoa!” Someone fell from the ball of light. Skillfully, he managed to stabilize his body in mid-air and landed on the ground safely without dropping that dramatically tall hat on his head.

        “Mad Hatter!” Doris shouted the man’s name and asked in surprise, “What are you doing here?”

        “Miss Doris!” The Mad Hatter lifted his head elatedly and said, “I finally found you!”

        “Find me? Did something happen?”

        “Yes.” The Mad Hatter stood up straight and continued worriedly, “Miss Alice has been depressed recently. She is always frowning… and she barely talks except when it comes to eating or drinking. We are all very worried about Miss Alice. We’ve tried different methods to cheer her up but none of them worked…”

        “How come? There must be something wrong. Let me think…” Resting her chin on a hand thoughtfully, Doris asked Mad Hatter, “How was meat for dinner? Did you bring her desserts afterward?”

        “The meat was all of the highest quality and the desserts were also brought to Miss Alice on time.”

        “What about the two bedtime horror stories every night?”

        “Of course I didn’t miss them. I even told Miss Alice three bedtime stories in one night recently.”

        “Umm… If so, she shouldn’t be upset at all. Something is missing. What is it?” 
Doris looked around. All she saw was a white land buried under the snow. The freezing air sent a shudder through her body yet it also gave her an idea.

         “Oh! Maybe she wants that!”

        “That?” The Mad Hatter tilted his head to a side in bewilderment. He tried to figure it out for a while but he failed, so he asked instead, “Miss Doris, what do you mean by “that”?”

        “Don’t worry about that. I know why Alice is unhappy. But I have to get someone first. Just head back to Wonderland first and wait for me!” Doris hurriedly picked up Toto and ran away before the Mad Hatter could say anything, leaving the latter no choice but to return to Wonderland and try his best to cheer Alice up.

        However, Alice remained sullen and silent for the next few days no matter what tricks the Mad Hatter did, and it was driving the Mad Hatter crazy.

        “When is Miss Doris coming back?” While the Mad Hatter hoped that Doris could come back to Wonderland as soon as possible, he prepared Alice’s dinner as usual. It was only after making sure that every dish was perfect that he went to Alice’s room.

        “Miss Alice, the dinner is ready. Today’s dinner is as sumptuous as ever!”

        “Mm.” Alice responded with a soft snort which was one of the few reactions she had given the Mad Hatter for the past few days. As she got out of her bed, she followed the Mad Hatter to the dining room only to walk into the pitch black.

        “Why is it so dark in here? Miss Alice can’t have dinner in a dark room like this,” the Mad Hatter muttered to himself. Just as he was going to turn on the light, the room lit up with a sudden snap, revealing two figures who ran to Alice with a gift and a cake in their arms.

        “Alice! Merry Christmas!” Doris and Woodbury shouted in unison.

        “You two… What are you doing here?” asked Alice, whose voice sounded a bit hoarse after a long time of reticence; her face looked rather tense for some reason.

        “The Mad Hatter told me that you were feeling depressed. Since Christmas is around the corner, I guessed you must be craving presents, so I asked Woodbury to help me get you one,” Doris said with a smile while raising the teddy bear that was half of her height in her arms.

        “Doris told me you want a teddy bear so I made you one! Isn’t it pretty?” Woodbury said proudly, lifting her chin, arms akimbo.

        However, Alice did not show a smile of joy. Instead, she became nervous and stuttered, “Doris, Woodbury… You…”

        “Alice, what’s wrong? You don’t like the teddy bear?” Alice’s hesitant reaction dampened Woodbury’s spirit.

        Seeing the look of dejection on Woodbury’s face, Alice immediately continued, “Wh-what took you two so long?”

        Alice took out two delicately wrapped gift boxes from her pocket and gave them to Doris and Woodbury. Then she explained awkwardly, “I… I just happen to have two spares. I was going to throw them away… But since you two are here, I guess… I may as well just give them to you.”

        “What?! Are you really giving these to us?” Doris shrieked in surprise.

        “This is the first gift Alice has ever given me! I’m so happy!” Alice’s gifts brightened Woodbury’s spirit. She and Doris took the gift boxes excitedly and opened them right away. Inside the boxes were two delicate silver brooches.

        “It’s so pretty!” Doris and Woodbury hurriedly put on the brooches. Together, they gave Alice a big hug while bursting into laughter.

        They said, “We love them!”

        Locked in a passionate embrace, Alice smiled and put her arms around her two biological sisters. With deep affection, she whispered, “I’m glad you like them.”

        “Sigh, so Miss Alice was depressed because she missed her sisters. For goodness’ sake, she could have just told me that.” Moved by the heartwarming embrace of the three sisters, the Mad Hatter took out a handkerchief to wipe away a tear from the corner of his eye.

        “Well, but I guess that’s just who Miss Alice is…”</p>
