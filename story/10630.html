        <h1>The Queen’s Dignity - Semele</h1>
        <p>        On Odyssey, the mother planet of the Holy Gods, some low-ranking soldiers diligently cleaned up the battlefield before the northern gate of the capital city, Olympus, where the ground was littered with the corpses of ferocious beasts.

        Not long ago, a starving pack of beasts had launched a surprise attack on the northern gate, intent on invading the town to feast on the satiated Holy Gods. Fortunately, the gate’s guardsmen swiftly adopted defensive measures, successfully trapping the beasts on the outskirts of the city. One by one, they vanquished the beasts, ensuring not a single citizen suffered harm.

        However, the main thoroughfare connecting the town was obstructed by the beast carcasses sprawled across the ground, so the captain ordered the other soldiers to remove the corpses, aiming to clear the path as quickly as possible.

        “This thing is huge. I can’t lift it by myself,” complained a young soldier upon seeing the behemothic corpse of a beast.

        “Well, just lift it as you’re told; otherwise, the captain will get on our case,” said an older soldier as he rolled up his sleeves. “I’ll help you.”

        However, even with the combined efforts of both soldiers, they could only manage to slightly elevate the carcass. Just as they were about to exhaust their strength, the enormous weight in their hands was suddenly lifted. A tall and robust female soldier effortlessly lifted the beast’s lifeless body with a single hand, placing it onto a nearby wooden cart. Her movements were smooth and graceful as if the beast’s corpse weighed nothing at all.

        The young soldier watched the whole process in admiration. He hurriedly approached the female soldier, eager to strike up a conversation, and he said, ‘Thank you! You have such incredible strength! But I don’t think we’ve met before. Are you new here?’

        “...Yes.” the female soldier responded coldly. The young soldier wanted to continue the conversation but the older soldier pulled him away.

        “We still have tons of corpses to lift over there. It’s not the time for chatting,” the older soldier reprimanded. Pulling the young soldier along, he leaned in closer and whispered in a hushed tone, “Can’t you tell that she clearly doesn’t want to talk to you? You’d only get the cold shoulder if you stayed.”

        “I was just curious,” the young soldier whispered, “Don’t you think she somehow looks like the King?”

        “What does it matter? If she was related to the King, why would she end up as a soldier here doing menial work?” the older soldier said.

        “Yeah, you’re right…” As the two soldiers continued walking, their voices faded into the distance and the female soldier could not hear their conversation anymore. Little did they know that their words had stirred up the feelings of embarrassment and humiliation that continued to linger within the woman.

        The young soldier’s speculation was correct—Semele, the female soldier, was indeed the daughter of the current King of Gods.

        Once a figure of glory, Semele had fallen from grace after choosing to elope with a peasant god, resulting in her father stripping her of her royal title. The first several years of her marriage seemed to be happy until Semele discovered her husband’s infidelity. Yet, her pride did not allow her to forgive the man, and thus she left with her daughter and returned to the capital, seeking refuge with the king.

        Although the king acknowledged Semele’s return, as punishment for her disgraced abdication of her status, he demanded that she start from the lowest rank of soldiers and work her way back up. At the time, Semele had no other choice but to accept and believe that she could quickly regain her former glory through her abilities. Thus, she approached even the most menial tasks with utmost dedication.

        However, her return was not welcomed by the other Holy Gods.

        Just then, a lavishly designed carriage sped down the main road but was forced to make an abrupt stop due to the bodies strewn across the path. The owner of the carriage pushed open the door and demanded with restrained anger, “What on earth is happening here?”

        The moment the captain, who was commanding the soldiers, noticed the carriage’s owner, his somber expression transformed into a fawning smile as he rushed forward. “Your Excellency, my apologies. We were just dealing with a recent attack by beasts, and we’re in the process of removing their bodies.”

        The man, one of the major gods, clicked his tongue in annoyance, his tone filled with impatience. “We have urgent matters to discuss with the king.”

        “Of course, of course.”  The captain nodded eagerly in agreement. Then, spotting Semele, who was efficiently maneuvering the carcasses, he called out to her loudly, “Hey! You over there! Hurry over here! Clear a path for His Excellency to enter the city!”

        With the carcass of a ferocious beast on her shoulders, Semele walked toward the carriage. As she locked eyes with the male god standing beside the carriage, both of them displayed a momentary expression of surprise. However, the male god quickly composed himself. Wearing an intrigued smirk, he spoke with a mocking tone, “Well, well, who do we have here? It’s been a while. I almost forgot you have been demoted. Isn’t it tough to be a guardsman? I thought you wouldn’t last.”

        The male god’s lips curled upward to form a grin laced with withering scorn. He continued, tauntingly, “Never mind, this position suits you just fine, as lowly as you are.”

        Semele’s face darkened, set in a deep scowl. The male god was her cousin, Geras, who had always seen her as a competitor. To win recognition among their kind, he even resorted to petty tactics to undermine her, but he had been held in check by the king in the past.

        However, now that Semele had lost the influence she once relied on, while Geras had become one of the twelve major gods, he was unlikely to show her any mercy. Having no intention of starting an argument with him, Semele remained silent. She simply turned away after she shouldered the beast’s carcass that obstructed the road, hoping to complete her task and escape his presence as quickly as possible. To her dismay, Geras did not let her off so easily.

        He unsheathed his longsword and swung it toward Semele’s direction, creating a magical blade of wind that sliced through the beast’s body on her shoulder and separated it into several pieces. The stench of fresh blood and innards splattered all over Semele, drenching her in a foul mess.

        “...What do you want from me?” Semele, disheveled and covered in filth, turned her gaze to Geras. A flicker of hidden anger brewed in her eyes, burning even more fiercely, undeterred by her demotion.

        Her unquenchable defiance ignited a peculiar emotion within Geras—the fact that instead of being smothered beneath the muck, Semele had not only refused to accept her fate but continued to struggle relentlessly, fueled inexplicable anxiety within him.

        “Nothing. I was just helping you,” Geras replied coldly, sheathing his sword. He looked down on Semele with an air of superiority and continued, “Helping you realize your place. You and your daughter only deserve to wipe these putrid beasts’ blood with your knees on the ground!”

        “You—” Semele had tried to contain her anger, but when Geras slandered her daughter, Nesoi, it became the last straw that broke the camel’s back for her. She locked eyes with Geras, her gaze fierce. Sensing the escalating tension, the captain hurriedly rushed in front of Semele and pulled her away, propelling her forward.

        “Stop standing here in the way of His Excellency! Go clean up the corpses quickly!”

        The captain’s scolding snapped Semele back to her senses. She clenched her fists tightly, her fingers digging into her skin, letting her blood drip as a painful reminder. Suppressing the overwhelming sense of humiliation and anger, she silently removed the carcasses from the road. Then she watched as Geras’ carriage disappeared into the distance before she continued to carry away the putrid corpses.

        It was nearly dusk when all the soldiers finally removed all the beast carcasses. Covered in blood and sweat, Semele returned home and a small figure darted out from inside the house as she opened the door. Seeing her disheveled appearance, her daughter, Nesoi, could not help but exclaim, “Mother! What happened to you?”

        “Don’t worry, I’m not hurt. It’s all the blood from the beasts. Just give me some time to clean it up first,” Semele reassured her frightened daughter and entered the bathroom to wash herself from head to toe thoroughly. She even washed twice, making sure to eliminate any lingering odor before stepping out.

        As soon as she walked out of the bathroom door, she saw Nesoi sitting by the door, her hands clasped around her knees, resembling a frightened little cub. With her heart softened, Semele squatted down and gently caressed Nesoi’s cheek, then she asked in a soft voice, “What’s wrong?”

        “Are you really not hurt, Mother?” Nesoi asked. Even though Semele had assured Nesoi, she still could not find peace of mind—seeing her mother covered in blood was such a distressing scene for a child to ignore. That was why she decided to sit by the bathroom to wait for her mother.

        “Your mother is strong. How could I possibly get hurt?” Semele drew Nesoi into her arms, hoping to use her warmth to calm her down only to hear a cry of pain from Nesoi.

        Semele’s expression changed as she heard the anomalous cry. She quickly released her grip and pulled up Nesoi’s clothes underneath which she saw bruises on her daughter’s stomach and arms. They were clearly more severe than what would result from simple accidents. Choked with rage, Semele looked at Nesoi and asked, “Who did this?”

        “...It’s my aunt,” Nesoi hesitated for a moment before answering the question, but she soon hugged Semele and obediently said, “It hurts a little, but it’s okay. I can take  it, so Mother, please don’t worry.”

        However, Nesoi’s heartfelt words failed to ease Semele’s troubled mind. Instead, it aggravated her sense of embarrassment. Powerless and without influence, she could not seek justice for Nesoi. Even she had chosen to endure the insults from Geras just moments ago.

        Unable to find release, Semele’s pent-up anger and frustration transformed into a burning conviction under Nesoi’s comforting presence. Embracing her daughter tightly, Semele enveloped the little girl in her arms and made a vow fueled by her will.

        “One day, I will make those who have mistreated us pay! I want them to suffer!”

        Soon, Semele’s opportunity came. With the frequent attacks from the beasts, the king decided to send his army to vanquish them and intended to uproot their nests completely. Geras proactively volunteered for the mission, and Semele became a member of his troop.

        After the army delved deep into the beasts’ lair, Semele took advantage of the chaos to lure the ferocious beast king toward Geras. She deliberately waited until the king severely wounded Geras to reveal herself and deliver the final blow, taking the greatest credit in the expedition and reclaiming her rights and title.

        With this battle as a starting point, Semele exhibited her ambition with remarkable competence, once again garnering the admiration and trust of the king. But even in the face of the gods’ praises, Semele could not forget the stench of beast blood that had drenched her, as well as her powerlessness to protect her daughter. It was the feeling of despair that led her down a path different from her original intentions...</p>
