        <h1>Seed of Forgiveness - Strelitzia</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.8

        In a musty room without sunlight where pots of plants and flowers wilted desolately in the shade, Stretlizia sat alone in a corner gazing out of the window quietly. She looked rather relieved for some reason. 

        Through the window, she saw the thriving Blossomville, which had recovered from the fire not long ago, and the sky looked even more boundless without the towering Mother Tree, which had been burned into ashes in the outcasts’ rebellion.

        On the day of the Century Feast, Papaver and her rebel army stormed into the palace. By Sakura’s choice, the Mother Tree was sacrificed. With all its power released, the Mother Tree met its end in flames after giving the floral-elves its last bloom of light.

        Although the Mother Tree’s light could spare the remaining floral-elves from withering temporarily, no one knew when it would be exhausted so the elves needed to find a new source of light.

        The rebel army, who also survived because of the Mother Tree’s light, fell apart as soon as they lost their target, and in the end, they were subdued by the imperial soldiers. All the elves, including Nepenthes, Rose, and the other innocent outcasts, managed to start a new life in the kingdom under Cornflower’s leadership.

        It was then that Hyacinth, the first prince, who was devastated by the death of his wife, Paperwhite, had a spiritual awakening. He finally let go of his fixation with the throne and volunteered himself to join the expedition team to find new light sources so as to make amends for what he had done to Paperwhite.

        On the other hand, Strelitzia, the first princess, was confined to the palace temporarily for her treachery of using her authority to sneak the rebellious outcasts into the palace, thus putting the kingdom in danger.

        As a result, Cornflower, the second prince, became the best heir to the throne, and today was his coronation. Yet, Strelitzia, who was forbidden to leave her chamber, had no choice but to miss the ceremony.

        Strelitzia was willing to receive punishment knowing her mistakes. The only regret she had was that she was unable to see Sakura, who had come out of the coma. She turned around and walked to her desk on which was a vase holding a cherry blossom branch that she had asked a maid to pick so as to ease her pain of lovesickness.

        She held out a hand to caress the buds on the branch. A stoical smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.

        “She should be standing beside Cornflower as the future queen right now,” she thought.

        However, Strelitzia was wrong.

        The door suddenly opened. Strelitzia turned around only to see Sakura, the elf of her dream.

        ‘Sakura!’ Strelitzia shouted in surprise. She hurriedly walked toward Sakura as soon as she found that it was not her imagination, and asked, ‘What are you doing here? Isn’t today Cornflower’s coronation? Shouldn’t you be by his side as his fiancée now?’

        ‘Cory sent me here. He has waived your punishment and you’re free now. As for our engagement, well…’ Sakura said with a smile that was no longer bashful but calm and sophisticated. She then continued, ‘I’ve broken off my engagement with Cory.’

        ‘Huh?’ Shocked, Strelitzia asked anxiously, ‘Why? I thought you two liked each other.’

‘Yes, we did but our feelings were different. Cory liked me in a sense that was romantically exclusive but I didn’t; I liked him just the same way I liked everyone else, like you, Strelitzia. So, I had to put things right.’

        “So I was no different from Cornflower…” Even though Strelitzia had long known that her feelings for Sakura would never be reciprocated, it still hurt her to hear the answer from Sakura. The heartbreak squeezed Strelitzia’s heart and she was at a loss for words for a moment.

        ‘Besides, I have my own mission now.’ Sakura lifted her hands to show Strelitzia a small flower pot. In the pot was a sprout sparkling with an iridescent glow.

        ‘I found this sprout in the soil where the Mother Tree used to be. I was worried that the bird might hurt it so I moved it to the pot. Maybe it will carry on the Mother Tree’s will and become the next Mother Tree!’ Giving Strelitzia a bright smile, Sakura added, ‘There is always hope as long as we’re alive, so I believe someone brilliant like you will be okay, Strelitzia.’

        The overflowing happiness on Sakura’s face warmed Strelitzia’s heart and she thought, “Yeah. I will learn to get over you and find my own path one day.”
