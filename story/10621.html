        <h1>Peachy Glamor - Chen Yuanyuan</h1>
        <p>        In an elegantly decorated room, two men sat behind a long table, while a tall and muscular young man stood in front of them, his movements and expression restrained and cautious.

        Wu Sangui, the man who was seated in the middle of the table, stroked the mustache on his upper lip, furrowing his brow slightly as he looked at the young man before him. “Introduce yourself,” he demanded.

        “I-I-I-I am L-L-L-Li, Li, Li, Li, Li—” the young man stuttered.

        “Stop. You’re not suitable for the job. Just leave,” Wu Sangui decisively rejected the young man as his patience ran out. Dejected, the young man left the room.

        “What kind of candidates have you brought in today? None of them are competent to be my bodyguards!” Wu Sangui pounded the table with discontent and berated his subordinate who was sitting on the right.

        Instead of feeling offended by the reprehension, the subordinate smiled ingratiatingly and respectfully answered, “Boss, don’t be mad. There are still many candidates waiting outside. We will find someone who meets your expectations.”

        “Humph! Let’s hope it goes well, or I’ll have you killed!” said Wu Sangui, crossing his arms before his chest. He continued to vent his lingering anger, “It’s all that annoying stalker’s fault! He kept sending me blood-stained blades and nails every few days, preventing me from having fun with any ladies this entire month. What’s worse, I have to spend a fortune hiring bodyguards to protect me!

        “Yes, you’re absolutely right. It’s all that despicable bastard’s fault,” the subordinate chimed in, eager to agree. “So let’s find you a good bodyguard as soon as possible so we can catch that bastard sooner. Let me send in the next candidate.”

        In response, Wu Sangui simply raised his hand. The subordinate immediately walked to the door, opened it, and shouted, “Next!”

        Clack, clack, clack. The sound of high heels hitting the floor echoed in a slow yet steady rhythm. The next candidate seemed composed and unhurried, which piqued Wu Sangui’s interest, so he patiently waited while raising his thick eyebrow.

        A delicate and subtly sweet fragrance wafted into the room before the candidate’s entrance. Wu Sangui and his subordinate were captivated by the scent, momentarily entranced, until they saw a young woman wearing a coat step into the room.

        As the woman approached the table, she lifted her head, revealing a face that carried a hint of allure. Her features were not conventionally beautiful, but combined, they exuded a unique charm and sensuality, making her more memorable than an ordinary beauty.

        “Good afternoon,” the woman greeted, curving her lips into a tantalizing smile. Her enigmatic expression had a touch of seduction, stirring the hearts of the two men present.

        “A woman with a striking appearance, exceptional temperament, and confident demeanor. She’s a type I haven’t tasted before…” Wu Sangui discreetly observed the woman, feeling increasingly intrigued.However, as a veteran hunter, he knew it would be best to conceal his emotions, so he pretended nonchalant and said, “Please introduce yourself.”

        “I’m Chen Yuanyuan, a demon cat. I used to live in Tōwa Teito for a few years but I grew out of the idea of staying there, so I came here, hoping to experience something new.”

        “I’ve reviewed your resume, and your qualifications are quite impressive, so I will get straight to the point. Can a woman like you protect me?”

        “Of course I can,” Chen Yuanyuan nodded, her movements carrying a languid charm. “But it’s hard to explain in words. Please allow me to demonstrate it to you.”

        “Huh?” Chen Yuanyuan’s words caught Wu Sangui off guard as he was still thinking about how to win over her, by fair means or foul. He slightly cleared his throat and nodded, saying, “Alright, go ahead.”

        “Apologies for what I’m doing next.” Chen Yuanyuan removed her coat, revealing her slender figure clad in a form-fitting qipao. The sight mesmerized both Wu Sangui and his subordinate, rendering them oblivious to the fact that she had swiftly bound them with silver threads, hanging them in mid-air.

        The silver threads sealed the subordinate’s mouth completely, preventing him from uttering a sound.

        “What is this? I can’t break free…” Wu Sangui twisted his body in an attempt to free himself from the silver threads, but to no avail. With a hint of embarrassment, he turned his head to look at Chen Yuanyuan and said, “Okay, okay, I acknowledge your skills. Now release me.”

        Unexpectedly, Chen Yuanyuan remained silent. She only gave him an even brighter smile while pulling out a small bell from her empty hand, producing a clear chime.

        As the bell rang, six women entered the room, one after another. Two of them had slightly protruding bellies—they were clearly pregnant.

        “You… What are you all doing here?!” Wu Sangui’s face turned pale as soon as he saw the six women.

        “They’re here to collect what you owe them,” Chen Yuanyuan spoke on behalf of the women, her eyes smiling with amusement. I find it quite amusing when a man two-timing a woman, but you’re beyond that level. You deceived six women and you even left two of them pregnant without taking any responsibility.”

        “Wh-what are you talking about? They all act of their own free will!” Wu Sangui tried to defend himself, but then he seemed to realize something. His gaze turned furious as he glared at the six women. “So, you’re the ones who kept sending me those bloody blades and nails!”

        “Sigh… So you still think what you did was right,” Chen Yuanyuan shook her head with pity, pulling out six daggers from her collar. She gracefully walked over to the six women, offering them the daggers. Ignoring Wu Sangui’s angry stare, she looked at the women tenderly and said softly, “Here, use these daggers to erase your past mistakes.” 

        The women took the daggers and, one by one, approached Wu Sangui, gritting their teeth as they stabbed the blades into his limbs. The excruciating pain made the man let out a gut-wrenching scream, tears streaming down his face, dismantling the arrogant look on his face.

        By the time the last woman gave her final blow, Wu Sangui was barely clinging to life. But when he saw Chen Yuanyuan walk closer, a surge of strength rose within him, and he angrily shouted, “I... I will kill you, Chen Yuanyuan! I swear I will kill you!”

        “Oh,” Chen Yuanyuan showed no signs of fear. Instead, she even smiled more joyfully, and added, “Is that so? Well, you have to live to do that.”

        Chen Yuanyuan put a hand on Wu Sangui’s thigh, and her fingers slowly crawled toward his crotch. The warm sensation sent Wu Sangui into panic, and he pleaded frantically, “Wh-what are you doing?”

        “For men who mistreat women, I believe the best punishment is to ensure they will never repeat the same mistake again, don’t you agree?”

        “No! NO! Please! Please, don’t! AHHHHHH—!” Wu Sangui begged desperately. Yet, his plea did not stop Chen Yuanyuan’s swift motion—

        With a crisp sound, Chen Yuanyuan severed the symbol of his manhood, which fell to the ground along with his body. The nightmarish punishment left him in excruciating pain and paralyzed with fear.

        Meanwhile, Chen Yuanyuan, who had lost interest in her defeated prey, took off her high heels and gracefully leaped out of the window, despite the fact that she was on the fifth floor. Effortlessly, she landed on the ground, showcasing the agility of a feline.

        “Phew.” Chen Yuanyuan yawned while luxuriously stretching her body. “That was exhausting. Let me go back and enjoy the cans of cat food my clients sent me.”</p>
