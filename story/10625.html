        <h1>Invasive Sprouts - Lady Meng Jiang</h1>
        <p>
                A man gradually regained his senses as a warm and moist sensation awakened his groggy consciousness. The first thing he heard was the sound of shuddering sobs, accompanied by more warm droplets falling onto his face, urging him to open his eyes.

        When he finally managed to lift his heavy eyelids with all his might, he saw the breathtakingly beautiful face of a girl with exquisite and delicate features that exuded a pitiful charm accentuated by glistening tears, melting the hearts of anyone who beheld her.

        It was a girl of around fourteen or fifteen years old kneeling beside the man. As soon as she saw him awake, she rushed into his arms, Clutching his clothes desperately. She cried out in a mournful voice, “Boohoo… I-I’m so scared… Pl-please don’t leave me…”

        The unexpected spectacle made the man’s body stiffen. But soon, he let down his guard and gently patted the girl’s back. He consoled her in a warm tone, “There, there. I won’t leave you. I will protect you.”

        Hearing the man’s reassuring words, the girl gradually calmed down and sat up straight. She averted her eyes from the man to hide her embarrassment.

        Meanwhile, the man surveyed his surroundings and discovered that both of them were confined within a dusty cage. It was a large cage, capable of holding dozens of people, yet it was now used to capture only the two of them. The empty space around them created an eerie and unnerving silence.

        “What happened? I was supposed to be with my students on an outing to the countryside, but I lost my memory after arriving at the beautiful bamboo forest… I wonder how my students are doing now. I have to get out of this cage and find my students!” The man quickly made up his mind. When he was about to take action, he sensed someone observing him from the shadows. Looking in the direction of the gaze, he caught the girl timidly flinching and turning her head away.

        “I can’t leave her alone. I have to take her with me,” the man thought to himself.

        Softening his expression, the man lowered himself to meet the girl’s gaze and softly asked, “My name is Wan Qiliang. What’s your name?”

        “I-I-I’m Meng Jiangnu,” the girl stammered.

        “I’ll call you Meng then. How did you end up here?”

        “M-my parents and I were on a trip, but I suddenly passed out when we passed through a beautiful bamboo forest. I found myself trapped in here where I woke up, and then I saw you collapse on the ground. I was worried that you were…so I couldn’t help but cry. I’m sorry that I couldn’t help you at all.”

        “No, that’s not true. Anyone would be scared if they were in your situation. You’ve already done a great job,” Wan Qiliang said, filled with overwhelming compassion. He reached out and gently stroked Meng Jiangnu’s hair. A blush rose to the girl’s cheeks as she enjoyed the gentle gesture.

        “Alright, let’s find a way to get out of here first.” After Wan Qiliang gave his cheeks a slap to rejuvenate his spirit, he approached the cage and carefully examined it. In his attempts to push the bars, miraculously, he found a gap.

        “Step back. Let’s see if I can push it open!” Once Meng Jiangnu had moved away, Wan Qiliang rubbed his hands together, tensing his muscles, and used all his strength to ram into the gap—

        Clang! Wan Qiliang broke a hole in the bars, just the size enough for him and Meng Jiangnu to squeeze through. Letting out a triumphant shout, he turned around and beckoned Meng Jiangnu over, calling, “Let’s get out of here now!”

        “O-okay!” Meng Jiangnu stepped forward and crawled through the hole under Wan Qiliang’s protection. As soon as they walked out, they saw a dense and beautiful bamboo forest. It turned out that the cage was hidden deep within the bamboo forest they both had seen before losing consciousness.

        “I recognize this place!” Wan Qiliang exclaimed with excitement. “There’s a village nearby. We can get help as soon as we pass through this bamboo forest!”

        “So…I can see Mom and Dad when we get out?” Meng Jiangnu asked timidly, contrary to Wan Qiliang’s excitement.

        “Of course! I’ll help you find them!” Wan Qiliang confidently assured her while thumping his chest. He continued, “Without further ado, let’s go! Or else the culprit who captured us might come back.”

        However, reality proved to be more challenging than Wan Qiliang had imagined. They had only walked a short distance when Meng Jiangnu let out a sharp cry. Startled, Wan Qiliang quickly turned around and saw Meng Jiangnu fall to the ground, her right foot caught in an iron foothold trap.

        “Meng!” Wan Qiliang rushed to her side, bending down to examine her wound. The sharp jaws were locked on her delicate ankle, cutting into her tender skin. Blood oozed slowly from her wound, making a stark contrast to her fair complexion and a distressing sight.

        “Damn it! This must be a trap set by the culprit! What a cruel bastard!” Wan Qiliang gritted his teeth in anger.

        “Ouch… It hurts so much…” Meng Jiangnu’s groan of pain brought Wan Qiliang back to his senses.

        “It’s okay. I’ll open it. Don’t move.” After saying that, Wan Qiliang grabbed the side of the trap jaws and forcefully pulled it open However, the trap jaws were more resistant than he had anticipated. Despite the cuts on his hands, he exerted more strength to pry open the trap. His blood dribbled down his skin and dripped onto the ground, mixing with Meng Jiangnu’s.

        Seeing that, Meng Jiangnu swallowed convulsively and licked her lips, yet Wan Qiliang missed that scene as she held her head low.

        With utmost effort, Wan Qiliang managed to pry open the trap jaws. Still, Meng Jiangnu’s ankle was so severely injured that she could only hobble along, moving at a slow pace, which made Wan Qiliang become anxious. Fortunately, he came up with a solution.

        “Meng, how about I carry you on my back? It’ll be faster that way.”

        “Huh? Bu-but won’t it trouble you? Maybe…,” Meng Jiangnu bit her lip, mustering her courage before saying, “Maybe you should leave me behind and run alone. I don’t want to burden you—Ouch!”

        Wan Qiliang pinched Meng Jiangnu’s cheeks. Displeased, he furrowed his brows and said, “You’re still a child. It’s my responsibility to protect you as an adult. Anyway, hurry up and hop on. We don’t have much time to waste.”

        “Okay… Thank you,” said Meng Jiangnu, who shyly lowered her head and climbed onto Wan Qiliang’s back.

        “Alright, hold on tight!” Carrying Meng Jiangnu on his back, Wan Qiliang swiftly began walking through the bamboo forest while carefully avoiding several traps along the way. As they made it halfway through the forest, the sky gradually darkened, so  Wan Qiliang stopped and set Meng Jiangnu down for a brief rest.

        Seeing their designation in sight, Wan Qiliang could not contain his excitement and said to Meng Jiangnu, “We’re almost out of the bamboo forest—”

        “Be-behind you!” Suddenly, Meng Jiangnu screamed in terror as she pointed behind Wan Qiliang.

        Wan Qiliang turned around only to see a two-headed beast in the distance racing toward them. With its crimson eyes that looked even more pronounced in the dark and its heavy breaths, it was clear that it was a menacing wild beast.

        “Run!” Even though Wan Qiliang immediately ran forward while shielding Meng Jiangnu, they could not evade the beast’s attack coming from behind.

        The beast’s claws left three deep wounds on Wan Qiliang’s back, followed by an agonizing pain that shot through his body. He almost fainted from the pain, but he knew both he and Meng Jiangny would be doomed if he passed out. Therefore, he forced himself to keep running regardless of the pain, dragging the girl along until they found shelter behind a large rock.

        “You’re seriously injured…” Meng Jiangnu burst into tears upon seeing Wan Qiliang’s wounds, her sorrow evident in her tear-streaked face.

        “It-it’s okay.” Wan Qiliang grimaced in pain, his forehead covered in cold sweat. Anyone could tell that he was lying. Still, he smiled and gently extended a hand to stroke Meng Jiangnu’s cheek, saying, “I’ll lure the beast away. While I do so, escape the bamboo forest and find someone to help you.”

        “But what about you? How are you going to deal with that beast alone?”

        “...It’s better than both of us getting captured together, ” said Wan Qiliang, holding Meng Jiangnu’s hand firmly, his voice sincere and passionate. “I promised to protect you, remember?”

        Meng Jiangnu lifted her head, her eyes shining bright like stars.  She gripped Wan Qiliang’s hand tightly, straightened her slender back, and with rare determination, she said, “I have a plan.”

❈

        A petite figure darted out from behind the rock, catching the attention of the beast patrolling the bamboo forest. It lifted its head and let out a howl before sprinting toward the figure like a gust of wind. Its speed outran the girl’s, causing her to stumble and fall to the ground.

        The beast grew more excited upon seeing its prey fall, its jaws opening wide to reveal a row of sharp teeth. Just as it was about to sink its teeth into the girl’s fragile neck, someone dashed forward, swinging the sturdy bamboo culm in his hands toward the beast. The powerful strike caught the beast off guard, sending it flying to the side.

        However, the beast quickly recovered. It attempted to stand up, only to find its body sinking uncontrollably. It turned out that it had landed in a swamp! It struggled desperately, but all its efforts only caused it to sink deeper and deeper. Soon, the beast completely disappeared into the boggy land.

        All of a sudden, the bamboo forest became quiet, with only the sound of Wan Qiliang’s heavy breathing echoing through the air. It took him a while to register what had happened and feel the warmth surging back into his body. He ran over to Meng Jiangnu’s side, a joyful smile spreading across his face. “W-We did it!”

        “Yes! We defeated that beast!” Meng Jiangnu wore a bashful smile which brought more charm to her already beautiful countenance despite the dirt on it. Wan Qiliang was momentarily stunned by her radiance. Meng Jiangnu blushed under his gaze. She tugged at his sleeve and asked softly,  “What’s wrong?”

        “N-nothing,” said Wan Qiliang while awkwardly scratching his face. He then regained his composure and asked, “Is your ankle alright? Can you walk”

        “Yes,” Meng Jiangnu stood up, holding Wan Qiliang’s arm, and she said, “I’m fine. Let me help you.”

        “...Thank you.” Wan Qiliang’s heart softened as Meng Jiangnu gently touched his skin, causing it to pound like madly.

        Supporting each other, the injured duo finally walked out of the bamboo forest. By then, the sun had just broken through the purple haze of dawn, illuminating the mountain path ahead and revealing a town below. Wan Qiliang’s eyes welled up with tears of joy, overwhelmed by the sheer relief of being alive after narrowly escaping death.

        “We did it! Now we just need to descend the mountain and ask for help. Let’s hurry. I’m worried about my students…” Wan Qiliang said as he walked. However, Meng Jiangnu did not follow him but stood before the bamboo forest. Puzzled, Wan Qiliang turned back and asked, “Meng, why aren’t you coming? Are you feeling unwell? Let me—ah!”

        Wan Qiliang lowered his gaze to find the grass underneath his feet had been stained with red. Incredulously, he discovered that the crimson color came from the two bamboo culms piercing through his thighs. The excruciating pain left him dizzy. Still, he clearly saw the person at the end of the bamboo culms.

        “Why…Why?” Despair filled Wan Qiliang’s eyes in an instant as he felt his life slipping away, and he demanded to know the reason.

        Meng Jiangnu lifted her delicate face and curved her lips into a sweet yet sinister smile, abandoning her bashful facade, and she gave a cruel answer, “Because, my dear, I’m the one who captured you and imprisoned you.”

        “No… It can’t be… How is that even possible…” Wan Qiliang’s ashen face twisted in agony and disbelief.

        Compared to the physical pain, the betrayal of being deceived by Meng Jiangnu, whom Wan Qiliang considered a companion, plunged him into deeper despair. The despairing agony transformed into scorching tears that eventually brimmed over his eyes. Strangely, Meng Jiangnu caught every drop of the tears before they hit the ground.

        Sticking out her rosy tongue, the girl captured those tears of despair and relished them. “Yes… Indeed, tears taste the best only when they are shed after hope turns to despair.”

        “Despair… So, you orchestrated all of this…”

        “Yes, no one managed to escape this bamboo forest before, except for you. They all left me behind and used me for their own survival. I have no interest in those filthy souls.”

        “So it’s you… You killed my students… Are you going to kill me too?” Every word Wan Qiliang uttered was accompanied by gasps for air. This had to be a nightmare, it must be just a nightmare.

        “Why would I kill you? Do you know that the tears shed by kind and selfless individuals are the most delicious? And you’ve captivated me the most among all the people I’ve met. So, I won’t kill you.”

        “No…” However, Wan Qiliang’s resistance proved to be powerless. He could only succumb and let countless bamboo leaves engulf him, while Meng Jiangnu held the fully cocooned man in her arms, wearing a sweet smile, as if she had found her beloved toy. She whispered, “Here, the father of my adorable little bamboo shoots, use your tears to nurture them.”</p>
