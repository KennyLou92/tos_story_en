        <h1>Romantic Enlightenment - Kushinada</h1>
        <p>Finale of Yamato - Ch.7

        “We’re making good progress! One more prayer on the full moon night and the poisonous magic in your father’s body should be cleared,” said Kushinada, smiling at the girl and her father.

        “Thank you so much. If it wasn’t you, I’d probably be dead…” The man scratched his head and thanked Kushinada shyly.

        “Although I’ve been helping, the biggest reason for the success is the love between you and your daughter.”

        The girl and her father smiled at each other as they heard Kushinada’s words.

        “Plus I can’t take all the credits! That guy worked hard too,” Kushinada continued.

        “Hehe, are you thinking of Susanoo?” The girl asked with a playful giggle.

        “Stop making fun of me, you naughty girl,” said Kushinada, flipping at the girl’s forehead.

        It had been two weeks since Susanoo left her. The time period wasn’t long, but somehow she thought of him all the time…

        Kushinada slapped herself, which was her usual gesture whenever she thought of Susanoo.

        “By the way, there’s a carnival tomorrow night. Do you wanna go with me?” The girl asked excitedly, making Kushinada unable to say no.

        Turned out it was a romantic-themed carnival, which explained the lovebirds everywhere. With such a scene, Kushinada felt even lonelier.

        “Kushinada, do you want a bite? This caramel apple smells so good!” The girl scurried back from a stall with a caramel apple in her hand.

        That reminded Kushinada of the days she had been through with Susanoo—— “Wow! This caramel apple smells so good! Would you like to get one?”

        Kushinada’s heart raced for Susanoo’s words and expressions.

        With mixed feelings, Kushinada took a bite of the caramel apple. It wasn’t sweet as she expected, but there was a touch of bitterness. She was hoping that the carnival could cheer her up, yet it did the opposite.

        “I think I should go,” said Kushinada, leaving promptly.

        At this moment, she heard a clear sound of dripping, which was strange for such a bustling place. Heading towards the sound source, she spotted a golden youkai stopping at a busy stall.

        Rounded golden youkai; Wealth-attracting youkai; Water-manipulating youkai…

        “Ahhhh! Fortune youkai, stand right there!” Kushinada yelled as she recognized the fortune youkai she had been hunting after.

        The startled fortune youkai fled right away. As soon as he left, the crowd surrounding the stall dispersed immediately, blocking Kushinada’s pursuit.

        The fortune youkai ran while Kushinada was chasing behind, as if a cat was hunting a mouse. The chase soon led them to a main street near the carnival, where it was quieter than usual as most of the people had gone to the carnival.

        On the quiet street, Kushinada looked around vigilantly, but the fortune youkai was nowhere to be seen. 

        “Humph! You really believe that you could fool me with this little trick?” Putting on a confident grin, Kushinada threw a few fulus into the air.

        “Light!”

        Blinding light was emitted from the fulus to illuminate the street, revealing a shadow. While the fortune youkai was wiggling in pain, Kushinada came to him cockily.

        “You have nowhere to escape now! Get ready to be captured!”

        She took out her fulu and reached over to the fortune youkai——

        “Wait, how come?”

        Darkness was exuded from the fortune youkai, putting out the light conjured by Kushinada. The darkness then gradually devoured her…

        In the boundless darkness, Kushinada saw the past of the fortune youkai——

        One day, the fortune youkai met a poor couple. His kind nature drove him to help them. However, not only they weren’t grateful, but they tried to imprison him.

        Although the fortune youkai managed to escape, he became everyone’s target since then. All the people wanted was to capture him and make money…

        In the dark, Kushinada heard the dripping again, and she finally understood it was the teardrops of the fortune youkai.

        “Go to hell! You greedy humans!”

        Kushinada became powerless as soon as she heard the fortune youkai’s voice. When her consciousness was fading, her promise with Susanoo brought her back. At this moment, she threw some fulus out, which exploded right away!

        The tremendous pain made the fortune youkai throw Kushinada out of the darkness. Still, Kushinada could barely sit up, watching the angry youkai approach her——

        Just when she lost her hope, countless water blades appeared to shatter the darkness.

        A man stood in front of Kushinada, who got a lift to stand back up. 

        “Haven’t we agreed to find the fortune youkai together after I come back? Look at the mess you’ve gotten yourself into,” said the man with a smile.

        “You idiot! What took you so long? You said you’d be back soon!”

        Kushinada was pissed when she saw the cocky look on Susanoo, beating him up as soon as she saw him. Yet she was relieved whenever she was with him.

        “Ouch! Alright alright! My bad! But I came to you right away as soon as I finished my business!” Susanoo apologised immediately.

        “So...how should we deal with this guy?” Susanoo asked as he caught the fortune youkai.

        “...Let him go,” said Kushinada.

        “For real? I thought you wanted to capture him?”

        “Yes.” She paused then continued, “but we shouldn’t harm others for our own desire.”

        Susanoo then put the fortune youkai down.

        Shocked, the fortune youkai bowed gratefully at them and left quickly.

        “I thought you’d plan to make a fortune from the youkai,” said Susanoo.

        “I used to believe that wealth was my top priority, but…” Kushinada couldn’t help but glanced at Susanoo.

        It wasn’t long for their separation, but it was long enough for her. And she realized that she was happy as long as she had him.

        “But what?” Susanoo wanted the rest of her answer.

        “But I don’t need the youkai to make big money! After all, I'm a beautiful taoist with solid skills!”

        “Is that so? But it was me who——Ouch!”

        Kushinada punched Susanoo again. Only this time, there was a happy smile on her face.
