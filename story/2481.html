        <h1>Evil-proof Swordmaster - Susanoo</h1>
        <p>Finale of Yamato - Ch.4

        “Ugh. Are you two sisters fighting again?”

        Leaping down the rooftop, Susanoo blocked Kagutsuchi’s kill shot for Amaterasu. Then Susanoo pushed Kagutsuchi away and hit his abdomen, blasting him into the air. At this moment, Tsukuyomi puppeteered Kagutsuchi to make him land safely.

        Susanoo conjured a water barrier by sticking his sword into the ground and pouring spiritual energy into it, which kept Tsukuyomi and Kagutsuchi away for a moment. When the battle ceased, Susanoo went over to Amaterasu to heal her. Fortunately, Amaterasu regained her strength quickly as her injuries were nothing critical.

        “How did you find us?” Amaterasu asked.

        “All thanks to this little folk.” Susanoo conjured a little black centipede. 

        “When I was on my journey, I saved a man from a poisonous magic and tamed this centipede. It’s my shikigami now,” said Susanoo proudly to Amaterasu. 

        “To my surprise, this folk is very sensitive to black magic. He’s the one who led me here!”

        “Looks like he has earned a lot from his journey,” Amaterasu thought, who was happy to see the changes in her brother.

        Deafening noises interrupted their conversation. At this moment, the water barrier was evaporated by Kagutsuchi’s fierce fire. While Tsukuyomi and Kagutsuchi were approaching, Susanoo and Amaterasu held their weapons tight for the upcoming battle.

        After pouring more energy into the threads that controlled Kagutsuchi, Tsukuyomi unleashed her power to attack Susanoo and Amaterasu at the same time! Amaterasu swung her fan, launching an energy strike to clash with Tsukuyomi’s attack.

        Meanwhile, Kagutsuchi ambushed, whose action was caught by Susanoo. He stepped up and fended the sucker punch for his sister.

        “Leave Kagutsuchi to me! Amaterasu, bring Tsukuyomi back!”

        As Susanoo was done speaking, he went on a face-off with Kagutsuchi.

        Sparks were generated when the metal swords collided. Without self-consciousness, Kagutsuchi’s attacks became regular and predictable. It didn’t take Susanoo long to figure the pattern out and knocked him down!

        “Kagutsuchi, wake up! You said you’d protect Amaterasu! Don’t lose yourself so easily!” Susanoo pointed his sword at Kagutsuchi’s throat.

        “Amaterasu...Protect Amaterasu...I…”

        “Yes! Not only you’re not protecting her, but you’re doing the opposite!” Susanoo yelled.

        Susanoo’s words brought a bit of Kagutsuchi’s sanity back. However, Tsukuyomi poured more energy to keep Kagutsuchi under control as soon as she sensed the resistance through the threads...
