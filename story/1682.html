        <h1>Unfortunate Fate - Cai Wenji</h1>
        <p>
                Dong Zhuo frequently visited Cai’s residence and sent valuable gifts, but was still snubbed by Cai Wenji. 
        Late at night, Cai Yong had not returned yet; Cai Yan looked worried, spending hours pacing at home.  Finally, the door opened and she greeted him with a smile, but she did not expect the person was actually Dong Zhuo.  He walked inside with a sneer; as Cai Yan wanted to drive him away, Dong Zhuo said sharply: “If I walk out the door, you father will be expelled!”
        “What are you talking about?” Cai Wenji was shocked.
        “Your father was found guilty of peculating the official fund of disaster relief, and was temporarily in jail.  Of course, I believe him, but someone just sued him——,” he whispered words in Cai Wenji’s ear: “As long as you’re willing to be my concubine, I can prove that your father is innocent.”
        Cai Wenji did not say a word.  She knew Dong Zhuo was a man of power.  There was only one way left to protect her family…
        “I’m looking forward to our marriage!  My little beauty.” Dong Zhuo left as he laughed out loud; Cai Wenji felt helpless, kneeling down and sobbing…
        In order to save her father, Cai Wenji had no choice but to marry Dong Zhuo, becoming his fourth concubine.  On the wedding night, Cai Wenji was like falling into the hell...Dong Zhuo was rough on taking her virginity and abusing her, so that he could get his sexual pleasure.  Cai Wenji was fainted because of the unbearable pain…
        As she woke up, she looked at the scars on her body and the blood on the bed.  All these were telling her it was not a dream.  She was humiliated, wailing like a madwoman; She tore off the bed sheet, which gave the maidservant a scare and then came inside to stop her. 
        Since then, Dong Zhuo often made out with Cai Wenji and sexually abused her.  Such hell-like experience had gradually paralyzed her nerves, living like a walking dead every day.  Until one day, she knew Cao Cao was still alive and back to the court to confront Dong Zhuo, which sparkled a glimmer of hope…
        In the middle of the night, she sneaked into Cao Cao’s residence, but was blocked by a girl of her age.  She recognized the girl, who stood right next to Cao Cao when they first met.  Her name was Xiahou Dun.
        “Master Cao Cao will not see you.  Please leave.”
        “But——”
        “Enough!  You’re Dong Zhuo’s concubine now.  Why bother with my Master?  Leave!”
        The words “Dong Zhuo’s concubine” reminded Cai Wenji of her identity.  Her body had long been ravaged by that despicable villain.  She remained silent and turned away.
        Just as she entered Dong Zhuo’s residence, the disgusting fat figure showed up——Dong Zhuo was sitting at the table, swaying from side to side.  He blushed, that means he was drunk.
        “Where did you go at midnight?  To meet Cao Cao?”
        “No...I just took a walk…”
        “Is that so?  You’re lying to me, aren’t you——” He stood up and punched Cai Wenji in the face.  She fell to the ground.  “Your maidservant has told me your whereabouts!  You slut!  How dare you lie to me about it!”
        He kept punching and kicking at her; Cai Wenji could simply curl up to protect herself.  She felt intense pains all over her body.  After a while, Dong Zhuo finally stopped.  Then he crouched down talking to Cai Wenji who was lying and trembling on the ground: “Every second I look at you, I feel disgusted!  Bring these things with you, and I’ll let you find Cao Cao!  After the task is done, you’re free to go!”
        “He won’t let me go inside...Ah!”
        Dong Zhuo kicked her in the stomach fiercely.  He grinned as he crouched down: “Look at those scars of you.  How can a man not show pity towards you?” 
        Cai Wenji came to Cao Cao’s residence again.  To her surprise, Cao Cao and Xiahou Dun were standing in front of the door.  She called for help as she rushed at them, but exhausted herself, falling into Cao Cao’s arms——
        “Help me...Dong Zhuo wants to kill me…”
        “Let’s go inside”
        Cao Cao took her to the room, gently put her to bed and ordered Xiahou Dun to check her wounds.  To her astonishment, there were new and old scars in different sizes.  Cao Cao found a doctor to diagnose her situation.  He said: “Yanny, get a rest.  I’ll send you back to Dong’s residence tomorrow.”
        Cao Cao was cold to Cai Wenji, but he still called her nickname just like the good old days.  Therefore, she thought Cao Cao might still remember the affection they once had when they were young.  Cai Wenji endured her pain and kneeled down: “Don’t!  Dong Zhuo forced me to marry him by putting my father’s life at stake.  It’s my last-ditch effort to save my father!  After marriage, Dong Zhuo thinks of you whenever he saw me.  So, he abuses me every day.  If you send me back, I rather die.  After all, my parents are long gone.”
        Cai Wenji decided to tell Cao Cao the scheme of Dong Zhuo if he was willing to protect her.
        “I risk taking you in tonight because my servants can keep it secret.  You’re his concubine.  If someone knows I’m hiding you, I’ll be denounced.  And Dong Zhuo will take this opportunity to stir up troubles.  Do you deserve me to risk my life for you?”  
        Cao Cao’s words were as sharp as a dagger, stabbing right into Cai Wenji’s heart.  She blanched with terror, without saying a word.  
        As they walked away, Cai Wenji changed her mind.  It seemed to her that Cao Cao could not possibly pull Dong Zhuo down.  She was powerless.  To get rid of living on tenterhooks, she could only hope Dong Zhuo would keep his words and let her go after the task was done.
        After making up her mind, Cai Wenji sneaked in the rooms of Cao Cao’s residence to hide the things given by Dong Zhuo——ten cursed dolls with the emperor’s name and horoscope.
        Her heart was beating hard; she recalled the day when she tried to stop her father doing such dirty tricks.  Now, she was following the same mistake of her father, but what else could she do?  She was already in hell. 
        “Sigh!  When did my heart become such vicious…” Cai Wenji mocked at herself, putting the last cursed doll in the backyard...</p>
