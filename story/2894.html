        <h1>Reconstruction of Order - Laplace</h1>
        <p>
                After Laplace had awakened from his long slumber, he encountered Baal, the first prince of protodemons. The two then formed an alliance, with Baal using Laplace’s powers to swiftly defeat opposition forces and win the support of influential nobles, ultimately securing his accession to the throne.

        Baal turned his attention to the unexplored continent of Tarones after his coronation. With the companionship of Laplace, he ventured into the foreign land and reclaimed the demon forces sent there as pathfinders from his younger brother, Belial. Yet, Belial managed to escape Baal’s grasp with the protection of his loyal subordinate, Azazel. Nonetheless, that did not affect Baal and Laplace’s plan—to conquer the universe.

        Despite everything progressing as they had envisioned, there was still an aching void in Laplace’s heart, a gap of loneliness. It was as if he had forgotten something agonizing but important.

        One day, like many days before, Laplace jerked awake from his barren dreams. The overwhelming sense of solitude made it unbearable for him to stay alone in the unfamiliar and frigid room. Hastily, he rushed outside the door and ran straight to the greenhouse in the garden, burrowing his body into the crimson waxy cocoon suspended in the center.

        Though faint, the cocoon still carried remnants of someone’s presence, someone Laplace had longed for. He curled up to let himself be wreathed by the lingering presence. It was not until then that the soul-consuming void and the swirling confusion within him gradually ceased.

        Calming his nerves, Laplace let his weary soul slowly sink into the depths of slumber. After an unknown amount of time, he sensed someone entering the greenhouse. His body immediately tensed, but he relaxed again as a large hand with a familiar scent touched his cheek. Longingly, Laplace nuzzled the hand with his face and called out the name of the existence deeply etched in his memories, “Vorvadoss… Don’t leave me… Mm!”

        A pressing pain on the cheeks jolted Laplace awake from his sleep. When he opened his eyes, all he saw was the frigid look on Baal’s face, the man who forcefully gripped his face.

        ‘It’s not him… He’s not Vorvadoss… Right, Vorvadoss has long gone, forever…’ Laplace could not help but repeat the heart-wrenching truth in his mind. A hint of disappointment flashed across his eyes, which only set Baal’s resentment aflame.

        With powers quietly gathering in his other hand, Baal took advantage of Laplace’s momentary grogginess and extended his hand toward the center of Laplace’s forehead—

        SLAP! Laplace forcefully slapped Baal’s hand away, staring at him in disbelief as he exclaimed, “What were you doing? Did you just try to erase my memories with magic?”

        “...Well, since he’s always causing you pain, wouldn’t it be better to tackle the problem at its root?” asked Baal under a nonchalant pretense while gently holding his right hand which had swollen up from Laplace’s strike.

        “Even if Vorvadoss causes me pain, it’s not for you to decide!”

        Laplace’s words left Baal stunned for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure. Self-mockingly, he retorted, “Right, I got carried away. I forgot that we were just playing a game, no strings attached. Worry not. I won’t overstep the boundaries again and it won’t affect our plans.”

        Baal took a step back. When he looked up at Laplace, the swirling affection and obsession in his eyes had disappeared, replaced by his usual cold and indifferent gaze.

        “You…” The sudden change in Baal’s attitude made Laplace fluster. He hastily stepped out of the cocoon and walked up to Baal. He stood on his toes to plant a soft kiss on his lips. However, Baal turned his face to the side and avoided the kiss. Embarrassed, Laplace hysterically yelled, “Why did you avoid me? Wasn’t that what you’ve always wanted?”

        “Not anymore. I can never win your heart as long as you refuse to forget him. So, I give up.”

        Baal pushed Laplace away. Paying no attention to the latter’s reaction, he resolutely walked away. As Laplace watched Baal’s receding figure, he felt as though his heart was clenched by an invisible hand, suffocating him with insufferable coldness. A wave of despair washed over him, leaving him helpless and vulnerable, the same feelings he had experienced in the past.

        ‘He’s leaving me again… Why did every important presence in my life leave me? Why did they all abandon me? Why can’t I ever keep them by my side… Why…’

        Crushed by the mountainous wave of agony, Laplace burrowed himself back into the cocoon, seeking refuge in the boundless realm of dreams. Yet, despair continued to haunt him, manifesting as the specter of the past.

        “Laplace, do you want to forget me?” Vorvadoss chuckled nonchalantly. “No, you can never forget me, for I have sacrificed my life for you.”

        The next second, Vorvadoss tore open his chest, revealing the embryo nestled within his pulsating heart—a representation of the ancient demon’s life essence. Countless verdant vines sprouted from the heart, swiftly growing into thick foliage that ensnared Laplace tightly.

        ‘Yes, I’m only alive because of Vorvadoss’ sacrifice. How can I forget him and seek solace from someone else… No, I can’t—’

        “It’s not like that, Laplace…” Amidst the hazy imagery, a peculiar and misshapen figure slowly descended from mid-air, breaking through the foliage that bound Laplace. They grasped his hand and spoke sincerely, “You need not bear the burden of guilt, for it is not your sin. Your life is destined to be resplendent and extraordinary, surpassing all of the others. You are my faith, the sanctuary of my soul. May your brilliance forever grace the tapestry of stars.”

        “Who… Who are you…” Laplace tried to discern the figure but the ethereal haze persistently obscured his sight. Nevertheless, an ineffable intuition stirred within him, affirming the profound importance of this presence in his life.

        “Now go, freed from the shackles of the past. Continue to observe and illuminate the path toward the future,” said the figure, nudging Laplace toward the radiance.

        “I—” Just as Laplace was about to respond, a clamor of running footsteps pulled him back to reality.

        A dozen demon soldiers barged into the greenhouse with a heavy scent of blood that replaced the serene fragrance of flowers.

        “Captain, we found a demon!” one of the soldiers reported.

        “Prince Belial commanded: we spare no one!”

        “Yes, Sir!” The soldier immediately walked toward Laplace, raising his weapons. He made a strike only to find his arms no longer exist—they had been cleanly severed.

        “AARGHHHH—!” the soldier clutched his profusely bleeding stump, his cries of pain attracting the attention of his comrades. The remaining soldiers glared at the young man standing before the crimson cocoon, hurling furious insults and demanding answers.

        “...Enough noise.” Laplace’s brow furrowed, his volatile emotions spiraling into impatience that quickly transformed into a surge of murderous rage. He eliminated them, one by one, until only the captain remained.

        Lifting the barely breathing captain into the air, Laplace leaned over him and softly inquired, “Who sent you here?”

        “P-prince Belial… Ah! His Highness has captured Baal, and you will all soon be dead— Mm!” Before the captain could finish his words, Laplace snapped his neck and unemotionally tossed his body aside.

        “Baal captured… That can’t be true. There is no way he would be captured… But he’s abandoned me, so I guess it’s none of my business anymore…” Laplace murmured softly as if trying to convince himself. Unfortunately, it proved futile for his heart had already soared, drawn inexorably toward that robust man. 

        “...Damn it! Laplace, unable to resist his desire in the end, left the greenhouse and headed to the mansion. Numerous soldiers dispatched by Belial attempted to stop him along the way. Yet, like insignificant ants, they all failed to wave Laplace’s resolute footsteps. Treading upon their spilled crimson, he eventually arrived at the front gate.

        Laplace pushed open the doors only to be enraged by the spectacle before him: Baal knelt on the staircase in the living hall. A multitude of captive nobles gazed helplessly from below, forced to watch as Belial disgraced and humiliated their king. Roughly seizing Baal’s hair, Belial raised his hand, poised to deliver a stinging slap—

        A formidable blast of elemental energy surged forth from the gate, perfectly aimed at Belial’s right hand. Azazel, standing by Belial’s side, keenly perceived the imminent threat and swiftly intervened, pulling him away just in time. The devastating blow hit the wall behind them and reduced a significant portion of it to rubble.

        Using his powers, Laplace pushed through the siege of soldiers and made it to Baal’s side. The king lifted his head, revealing a triumphant smile as he said, “You came.”

        “...So you did it on purpose,” Laplace said.

        “Yes, and you knew it. Still, you came to save me because you care, Laplace.”

        ‘He’s right. I care about him, I’ve had feelings for him since a long time ago… This has become more than a mere game…’ Laplace closed his eyes, deep in introspection. When he opened them, his vulnerability was unmasked. Somehow embarrassed, he averted his gaze and said, “...You win. So how much longer do you intend to lie on the ground?”

        “Haha, don’t be mad. I’ll finish them in just a moment,” Baal proclaimed as he touched the gleaming golden pendant on his neck, infusing it with magic. The essence of Laplace’s power within the pendant surged to life, neutralizing the toxins in his body.

        Baal rose to his feet. After gracefully tidying his disheveled attire, he shifted his gaze to Belial and Azazel, who stood on the opposite side with a vigilant stare. A smirk played at the corners of his lips as he declared with unwavering confidence, “Now, let’s do some cleaning.”</p>
