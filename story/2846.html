        <h1>Elemental Mysterian - Molly</h1>
        <p>
                Molly never stopped missing the good old days of her fighting along with her companions as well as the company of the young swordsman, even after she had merged with the power of elements. To console her lonesome soul, the elements showed her a fictitious future—

        “Open the door for me—” shouted Sean, who raised his sword and charged at the Valkyrie bravely.

        “No! I’m staying!” Molly wanted to go and help Sean but Nathaniel stopped her.

        “Molly! We’re on a more important mission! Don’t let your emotions get in the way!” Nathaniel’s harsh words cooled down Molly’s head. She hesitated as the memories of the unsparing battlefield and the pact with her companions flushed back into her mind.

        However, her heart ached as if it was stabbed by a knife when she saw the Valkyrie’s sword leave a cut on Sean’s body. Her reason and aspiration were shattered in an instant; all she had left was consternation for the man she loved.

        “No matter how important saving the world is, it’s not the reason for me to leave him in danger!” Showing her rare tough side, the soft Molly broke away from Nathaniel’s grip and ran to Sean. She took Sean’s hand and ran back to their companions while resisting the Valkyrie’s attack with her wand.

        Molly and Sean managed to escape the Valkyrie’s pursuit and made it to the Ocean of Gates thanks to the protection of their companions.

        With help from Sean and Duncan, Molly convinced Endor and Nathaniel to contribute their power to secure the seal on the tower so that humanity could have a short moment of peace.

        “Although we did stop the demons’ scheme, there’re still some demons left in the realm. I’m going back to the army to make the next plan. What about you guys?” asked Nathaniel, who stood tall and proud before the tower. His will did not waver despite having lost most of his strength.

        “Let me help you!” Sean answered hastily. However, Nathaniel shook his head and turned him down. “No, you’re too deeply wounded. Let’s talk about it after your body recovers.”

        “Nathaniel is right. You have always protected us and you’re the most wounded among us…” Lifting her head, Molly finally plucked up enough courage to look at Sean. With a flush of embarrassment rising to her cheeks, she asked, “Will you go back to the academy with me? Th-then I can take care of you.”

        “Molly…” Sean’s heart skipped a bit. The feelings that he had suppressed due to the war began to spurt. He could not help but answer with a smile of unconcealable joy, “Yes, please.”

        Molly’s heart bloomed as she heard Sean say yes, and it brought a radiant smile to her face. After watching Nathaniel, Duncan and Endo go, Molly and Sean headed back to the academy where they received a warm welcome.

        At first, Sean really enjoyed the rare peaceful days with Molly in the academy. As time went by, however, he found something missing. The void in his heart made him unconsciously irritable.

        To relieve the feeling of annoyance, he started practicing swordsmanship again, drenching himself in sweat in the dusk.

        On the other hand, Molly, who had spent days with Sean, noticed his change and she was not surprised at all. It was as if she had known the day of parting would eventually come from the moment Sean agreed to return to the academy with her.

        Finally, Molly saw Sean with his packed bags when she returned to the dorm after class one day. She remained silent for a while at first, but she soon gave him a smile and asked, “So, you’re leaving, right?”

        “Yeah. My wounds have all healed, and it’s time for me to do what I should do,” said Sean looking deeply into Molly’s eyes. He adored this girl who had grown throughout the tragic times of war and become a forgiving and visionary sorceress. Still, he could not hide his quivering ambition so he asked with little hope, “Will you come with me? Just like the old days.”

        Instead of answering the question, Molly looked at Sean with tears brimming in her eyes. Bathing in the evening sunlight, the young swordsman looked even more heroic with the burly body and unsightly scars he had gained from multiple fights against death.

        Sean had never stopped blazing a trail for his companions even in the face of difficulties. It was his courage and determination that touched her heart; it was what made her admire him and want to chase after him. However, people are not always free in the real world. With age comes a lot of worries and concerns that will dampen one’s spirit. Molly was no exception; she could no longer put Sean and saving the world as her first priority the way she did before, so she shook her head.

        “I want to go with you but I can’t. I can’t leave my students alone. I want to teach them everything I know so that they can live longer on the ruthless battlefield.”

        “Is that so?” Sean returned her a smile of relief, his eyes filled with deep affection. Proudly, he continued, “I knew it. You’re the best sorceress I know.”

        “Yeah, and you’re the best swordsman I know,” said Molly in a soft voice. She stepped forward to give Sean a hug as the grandest gesture of goodbye before their reunion in the unknown future.

        Although the two stayed connected through letters after they had parted ways, they inevitably grew apart in the ceaseless war between the gods and the demons. Even though they missed each other, their lives were interlaced with other people at the same time. Status and duty divided the lovers. War incessantly took friends away from Molly with their names carved onto headstones one after another, churning memories into shards of regret…

        “I must move on for peace and our pact even if I have to leave the man I love!”</p>
