        <h1>Lady of Life - Gaia</h1>
        <p>
                “In order to deal with Humans, I have to reclaim the godly power in the Divine Tree...I wonder how it is now.” Gaia came to the Divine Woodland.  Seeing such a flourishing scene, she wore a sincere smile.  She flew to the woods, and travelled back and forth to feel the breath of life, for which Humans had showed no regard.  Therefore, her determination to eliminate them was unshaken.  After a while, Gaia landed on the towering Divine Tree.
        “Divine Tree, Humans keep destroying this world.  To repel them, your power is essential to us.  I have to reclaim your godly power.  Please forgive me.” Gaia embraced the trunk; both of them immediately sparkled with emerald light.  Countless light spots gathered around Gaia, giving a great boost to her godly power.  At the same time, a flash of memories streamed into her mind.  Gaia soon knew those memories belonged to the Divine Tree. 
        During Gaia’s absence, many things had happened in the realm of Humans——the invasion of Gods and Demons.  Gods built their home with elemental power at the expense of the realm of Humans, which began to collapse into chaos.  Wars and disasters lingered for years; Humans lived in the war-torn place like hell...All these memories were vivid and immersive, as if she had been there.  “...So it is our fault?  No!  No!  I have to bring the peace back!” Gaia whispered as she kneeled down and wept bitter tears.  Then, she leaped into the air and discovered that there was a strange green light on a deserted land; Gaia flew to its direction with great speed right away.
        The bizarre light was from a device created by Gods for sucking elements in the realm.  It was still functioning.  The light got brighter and brighter as the earth elements were absorbed.  Landing in front of the device, Gaia was electrified by the magic barrier when she touched it, and immediately let go of her hand. 
        She took a step back and casted an elemental sphere over the device with her godly power.  To her surprise, it bounced off without penetrating through the barrier.  Gaia was stunned, but she managed to dodge the sphere in time.
        “The Godly power is useless to it.  Well——” She put her hands on the ground and said, “Take this!” 
        Gaia's body and the ground were emerging strong green light!  As it faded, there was a violent earthquake suddenly; numerous trees were born from the soil, slamming on the device.  However, the trees still could not break the barrier and began to crack.  Gaia unleashed stronger power to summon more and more trees to attack the device from all directions.  In the blink of an eye, it was completely covered with the woods, which made the barrier start disintegrating.  She captured this opportunity to circulate more power, eventually destroying the barrier as well as the device!  Endless light spots floated out from the trees and scattered over the realm of Humans…
        As soon as the light touched the deserted land, it came back to life, covered with grass and flowers.  It was not until then that Gaia realized the whole place was actually not like this.  Animals were unable to survive due to a  lack of earth elements, which turned the realm into a barren land.  Now that the world had returned to its original beauty, Gaia broke into a smile. 
        While she was enjoying the breath of the nature, a meteor-like shadow approached with lightning speed.  Beyond all expectations, she was Aether.
        “Did you just break the device?” asked Aether.
        “If not, the realm will perish some day.  Thousands of innocent lives will be sacrificed!” 
        “So what?  Humans are destined to serve the Gods.  They should glory in sacrificing their lives for building our residence!”
        “I’ll never agree to your nonsense!” Gaia looked at Aether in astonishment.
        “What a pity...Then I have no choice but to kill you!”
        As Aether was about to cast light elemental attack over Gaia, Gaia had already conjured a giant wood to counter her.  The wood transformed into a dragon to engulf Aether, who was unable to get rid of it no matter how hard she tried.  Because of the overuse of godly power, Gaia felt exhausted and rested on the ground.  As she thought Aether was successfully subdued, a dazzling light shone from behind...
