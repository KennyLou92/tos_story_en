        <h1>Absolute Order of the World - Giemsa</h1>
        <p>
                The Goddess of Order had been guarding the gate to the realm of gods for a long time. During her guardianship, the elements, sensing the hidden loneliness and void within her, created the illusion of a false future to squander her time away…

        A heated debate among the gods led Giemsa to the hall. Upon learning that Zeus intended to extract the elements from the human realm to create a new utopian realm for their kind, Giemsa, of course, stood in opposition to his plan, knowing that it would only disrupt the balance of the realms and throw the world into complete disorder, bringing unimaginable consequences. While she pondered over a feasible solution, Zeus walked to her and asked, “So, are you against us?  Or are you still willing to guard the gate for us?”

        ‘Of course I’m against them, but I alone don’t have the power to stop them… Must I stoop to compromise and wallow in the mire with them?’ Giemsa unconsciously bit her lip, recalling every detail of her past with Phoenix, including the horrific image of his final moments that she could never forget. And hence, a burning rage surged within her as she saw the haughty grin on Zeus’ face.

        ‘It’s him, Zeus. He killed Phoenix, and now he leads everyone down a path of greed. It’s all his fault!’

        The resentment over the unjust death of the man she loved, coupled with the disgust for Zeus’ overbearing demeanor, fueled Giemsa’s hatred to its peak. The irresistible impulse eventually manifested into actions: she channeled her powers to gather the elements in her palms and form a long sword, aiming Zeus under the gaze of the stupefied gods.

        Swish! Her sword pierced through Zeus’ shoulder. Blood gushed out, accompanied by a searing pain that caused him to let out a loud groan. Fuming with anger, he roared at Giemsa, “How dare you stab me! You traitor!”

        “Zeus, I never pledge my loyalty to you! You are a foolish and avaricious ruler who is unworthy of taking the throne of gods!”

        “You—!” Zeus’eyes bulged with rage. Through gritted teeth, he declared, “The audacious goddess, Giemsa! Not only have you wounded me, the King of Gods, but you also dare to speak against me. Soldiers, take this traitor to the glacial depths of the realm of gods, where she shall be imprisoned and condemned to frostbitten pain for the rest of her life!”

        Giemsa’s resistance was destined to be in vain as she stood against all gods. Later, the god soldiers sent her to the glacial prison, where she endured a bitter chill that seemed to blanket her entire body. Despite the unbearable chill, she felt an unprecedented sense of relief and freedom in the prison since she no longer had to hide her grief and resentment, nor did she need to entertain Zeus and the other gods with a mask of obedience. She was free at that moment.

        Huddling in a corner, Giemsa felt the elements within her slowly ebb away. Her breath grew weaker with each passing moment, and she knew her death was imminent. However, she held no fear but an eager anticipation.

        ‘Phoenix… Soon, I can see you again.’ Giemsa closed her eyes, prepared to embrace her end in silent peace. However, an unexpected noise forced her to open her eyes once more, only to see water materializing out of thin air. The water swirled rapidly and eventually took on the form of a man.

        “Yuanshi Tianzun!” Giemsa exclaimed in astonishment.

        “Giemsa,” said Yuanshi Tianzun, walking up to the prison. With a gaze filled with sorrow and compassion, he looked at the disheveled Giemsa and sighed, “So you gave in to your impulses after all.”

        “...I’m sorry.” Yuanshi Tianzun’s words of disappointment brought Giemsa an overwhelming sense of guilt. Choked with emotions, she said, “I was too weak, and I failed you.”

        “What’s done is done. There is no use looking back,” Yuanshi Tianzun spoke in a solemn tone. “Now let’s go back to the Heavenly Kingdom.”

        “But… Bring me back might incriminate you and the kingdom.”

        “Despite what you have done, you’re still my junior fellow apprentice. As long as your actions do not violate the laws of the world, it is only natural for me to protect you. Besides, what you have done is in line with the wishes of the Heavenly Kingdom, so what you said was just groundless worry.”

        “Yuanshi Tianzun…” Stirred with emotions, Giemsa whispered, “I understand. I’ll go back with you, and together, we will find a way to stop Zeus—”

        “Hush!” Yuanshi Tianzun suddenly interrupted her words. In the abrupt silence, a flurry of footsteps came, followed by the arrival of Zeus and a group of god soldiers.

        “I knew you’d come, Savant of Pure Jade,” Zeus raised his chin, his arrogance barely concealed as he spoke, “Savant, since I hold you in respect, I promise that I won’t pursue your intrusion if you choose to leave now.”

        “Zeus, the King of Gods, your false promise would be unnecessary. I understand that you can’t stand the existence of the Heavenly Kingdom, whether I save Giemsa or not,” Undeceived by Zeus’ hypocritical statement, Yuanshi Tianzun revealed his true intentions.

        “Heh, so it seems we can’t talk it through.” Zeus then raised his hand, giving a command to the soldiers behind him. “Attack!”

        Under the siege of Zeus and the god soldiers, Yuanshi Tianzun failed to attain a position of strength in the battle. Yet, his purpose remained unchanged: he had come to take Giemsa out of the prison, not defeating Zeus and his soldiers. Hence, he did not engage in prolonged combat with them. Instead, he evaded their attacks while swiftly breaking through the encirclement using his Water Escape technique. Finally, he managed to flee to the human realm with Giemsa.

        However, Yuanshi Tianzun collapsed as soon as they arrived in the human realm—Zeus’ attack had severely injured him. It was with sheer willpower that he managed to push through the encirclement, but now that he had reached a safe place, he no longer had the strength to go on.

        “Yuanshi Tianzun! Le-let me heal you now!” said Giemsa, mustering her powers to heal Yuanshi Tianzun’s wounds, but he stopped her.

        “Giemsa, stop. My injuries are beyond recovery.”

        ‘Why… Why does it always end up like this? Watching the people I care about leaving me one after another…’ The agony of helplessness plunged Giemsa into the depths of despair. She loathed her incompetence and regretted the choices she had made. The overwhelming frustration eventually turned into tears and streamed down her face as she murmured, “It’s all my fault… My impulses led to this…”

        “Now is not the time to grieve,” Yuanshi Tianzun said seriously, “Giemsa, I need you to lead the Xians to stop Zeus and his followers so as to protect all living beings.”

        “...Yes. I promise,” Giemsa suppressed her tears, looking resolutely at the frail Yuanshi Tianzun.

        “Good, good, thank you, Hiemsa…” With Giemsa’s assurance, Yuanshi Tianzun peacefully closed his eyes, and soon after, he breathed his last. His body transformed into sparkles of elements that enveloped Giemsa, passing on his lifelong powers to her.

        Afterward, Giemsa returned to the Heavenly Kingdom, assuming the leadership of the Xians in the absence of Yuanshi Tianzun, defending against Zeus and the gods in the human realm…

         “To fulfill Phoenix’s last wish, I must refrain from impulsive actions. I must conceal both my strengths and desires, and patiently bide my time until the opportune moment arrives.”</p>
