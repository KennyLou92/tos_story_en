        <h1>Yukina</h1>
        <p>
        Yukina is also known as kōrime.  As her tears can solidify into priceless gems named “hiruiseki” (crystal tears), she is abducted by Tarukane.  Later on, Yukina is saved by Hiei, but she doesn’t know he is actually her separate brother since she was born.  Yukina has been searching for her brother in the human world, and she is not aware of Kuwabara’s feeling on her.  </p>
