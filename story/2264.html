        Imperial Heroes - The Finishing Battle Ch.6

        As part of Liu Bei’s crew, Huang Zhong headed to the alliance meeting with Sun Quan and Lü Bu in Kingdom Wu. Despite a minor quarrel, the meeting ended up in peace eventually. 

        On their way back, Zhuge Liang found out Cao Cao’s plan to ambush Lü Bu as they ran into Cao’s army in the forest. 

        As soon as they figured out Cao Cao’s conspiracy, Liu Bei returned to Kingdom Wu to seek backup from Sun Quan.

        Because of such a short notice, Sun Quan was unable to arrange a massive reinforcement for the rescue. While Sun Quan was getting the army ready, he deployed Zhou Yu and a strike team to join Liu Bei’s rescuing operation.

        The rescue team travelled restlessly as fast as they could, making the road dusty. Despite the exhausting long haul, they managed to hold on.

        “The city gate is close! I’ll head over there first!” Guan Yu shouted, riding at the front.

        “Guan Yu, wait! Don’t act recklessly!” 

        Liu Bei’s warning was too late as Guan Yu had already long gone.

        Arriving at the gate, Guan Yu hopped off her horse and talked to the guard, “We’re from Kingdom Shu——”

        The guard struck a spear at Guan Yu before she could finish her words. When the spear was about to stab into her, the guard was killed by an arrow in his head——a crack shot from Huang Zhong.

        “Come back here!” Huang Zhong reminded Guan Yu.

        Meanwhile, he fired another arrow, buying time for Guan Yu to retreat. However, the next threat was coming right up——a swarm of army marching out from the city.

        “Isn’t this Lü Bu’s territory? Why are his soldiers after us like rabies?” Guan Yu asked.

        “I guess Cao Cao has already taken over this place before Lü Bu returned. If this is the case, Lü Bu is in great danger now…” Liu Bei pondered then said to Huang Zhong, “Guan Yu and I will stall the soldiers here. You infiltrate the center area to rescue Lü Bu.”

        “Guan Yu can fight, but she’s not good at stealth. Is that why he assigned me to do so? Liu Bei is such a good strategist,” Huang Zhong appreciated Liu Bei’s decision making in his mind.

        “Leave it to me!” Huang Zhong was galloping immediately. All the soldier targeting at him were blocked by Liu Bei and Guan Yu, allowing him to enter the city.

        “It’s too obvious if I ride my horse to the center area. It’s in walking distance. I can go on foot.”

        Hopping off the horse, Huang Zhong jumped onto a roof to get rid of the pursuit. It didn’t take him too long to infiltrate the center area. Peeking outside the grant hall, he saw a troop safeguarding the main entrance.

        “The main entrance is heavily guarded. Gotta sneak in through the side door.”

        Huang Zhong crept to the east hallway, where there was only a soldier guarding the entrance. Soon, the soldier was knocked out by him easily.

        Crouching down, Huang Zhong spied inside the grand hall through a window——Lü Bu, lying on the floor, had his head trampled by Yuan Shao, while his wife Diao Chan was held hostage by a single-eyed woman.

        Huang Zhong was then triggered as he looked at the man sitting at the center of the hall.

        “Cao Cao! I finally meet you again…” His family’s tragic death flashed across his mind. The vengeance made him grip his bow tighter.

        “If I shoot him now, at least he’ll be critically wounded…” Huang Zhong hesitated when he stared at Cao Cao, who was protected by a group of bodyguards. It might be a mission impossible for ordinary archers, but not for such a skilled marksman like Huang Zhong.

        “No...My mission here is to rescue Lü Bu. I can’t sabotage the crusade because of my own business.”

        Huang Zhong took a deep breath to calm himself down.

        “Lü Bu can’t fight back because of the hostage. What I need to do is freeing his wife.”

        The wide awake Huang Zhong fired his arrow in a split second, penetrating the window all the way to Xiahou Dun. Despite her agile defense, another arrow came right after the previous one, for Huang Zhong had shot two arrows with the same ballistic.

        Xiahou had no choice but to let go of Diao Chan and leap backwards.

        Without taking a break, Huang Zhong barged through the window and took Diao Chan away from the danger.

        “Lü Bu, Liu Bei has come with backup!”
