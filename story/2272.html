        <h1>Devil Eye Seal - Xiahou Dun</h1>
        <p>Imperial Heroes - The Finishing Battle Ch.9

        After eliminating Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao received a rocket promotion by impressing the young emperor with his contributions. Yet he wanted more than just a high-rank position, so he snatched the throne after he had recruited sufficient force. Ever since his coronation, he had been ruling the kingdom with an iron fist. This tyranny eventually gave rise to a group of rebels——Liu Bei, Sun Quan and Lü Bu who swore to overthrow Cao Cao.

        Cao Cao, who wouldn’t sit back obviously, incited Yuan Shao, Lü Bu’s henchman, to turn against him. The traitor allowed Cao Cao to infiltrate Lü Bu’s state during his absence. However, Zhuge Liang figured out this conspiracy and had Liu Bei rescued Lü Bu.

        As soon as Xiahou realized the threat, she led the remaining soldiers to escort Cao Cao out of the city, escaping through the hillside near the coast.

        “Sima Yi and her reinforcement still haven’t arrived...Is something dragging her back?” the frowning Xiahou Dun whispered at Cao Cao as she looked at the empty slope.

        Cao Cao answered after a moment of silence, “that should be Liu Bei’s strategist...Zhuge Liang has proven an outstanding mastermind since she was young. What a shame that I didn’t kill her back then.”

        “Your majesty, a fleet with Sun’s flags is approaching!”

        “Y-Your majesty, we have a thousand of troops incoming from the back!”

        “Your majesty, cavalries just set off from Lü Bu’s city on our right!”

        The recon soldiers reported in a hurry. When the rest of the soldiers heard the news, their hearts sank, for they could foresee the end of this battle.

        “The sea is on our left. Does that mean we are encircled?” Cao Cao said.

        Instead of being panicked and frightened, Cao Cao treated such bad news like a fun challenge, “ha. Isn’t that fun? We’re about to be doomed. Let’s see if we can get away from this.”

        Pulling his sword out, Cao Cao grinned wickedly. The bloodlust exuded terrified the rest of the soldiers.

        “This is different from all the crises we’ve encountered before. Our enemies are well prepared for this…” As Xiahou Dun pondered, she made up her mind very soon. “I must protect him at all costs!”

        Much as Cao Cao sensed Xiahou Dun’s quiet approach, he didn’t guard himself, for he would never expect an attack from her——Bang! Xiahou Dun knocked Cao Cao’s neck with her sword handle.

        “Dun...Why...did you…” Cao Cao then fainted in surprise. 

        When Xiahou Dun caught the unconscious Cao Cao from falling, she spoke to the canopy above her, “Zhang Liao, get down.”

        “How come you always catch me?” A well-built man Zhang Liao leapt down from the tree. “Huh? My creditor fainted,” he said as he looked at Xiahou Dun.

        “Sun’s navy takes time to get themselves ready after landing, and that makes them the weakest among the three incoming forces. So you’ll be taking Cao Cao to break through the circle and meet up with Sima Yi,” said Xiahou Dun. As she gave a horse to Zhang Liao, she continued, “your debt will be cleared after you accomplish this task.”

        “How about you? You’re not coming?” Zhang Liao asked.

        She shook her head to imply a “no”. When she was gazing at the approaching enemies, she said, “I must stay here.”

        “Someone has to stall the incoming troops in order to buy more time for Cao Cao...Even death is what it takes,” Xiahou Dun thought.

        “...I get it. Don’t worry. I’ll deliver him to Sima Yi!” Zhang Liao promised, responding to Xiahou Dun’s determination with his seriousness.

        “Go!” As Zhang Liao yelled, the horse that carried Cao Cao and Zhang Liao sprinted straight away. Very soon, they disappeared at the end of the road.

        After watching their departure, Xiahou Dun drew her sword, raised it up high and commanded.

        “FIGHT!”

        The rest of the soldiers responded with a high-spirited yell. Then the troop set off to approach the Shu’s force at the back.

        “Lü Bu’s calvaries are still far away from us. If we can defeat Liu Bei’s army before they arrive, maybe we still stand a chance…” Xiahou Dun refused to give up on hope, trying to make the impossible possible.

        Xiahou Dun and her soldiers lurked at the spot where the Shu’s force would pass by, preparing for an ambush.

        “Here they are...The commander is really her...Guan Yu!”

        Staring at the leading blue-haired girl, Xiahou gripped her spear tighter and thought, “I only have one shot. If I can kill her, Shu's force will collapse immediately...Then I’ll be able to see Cao Cao again.”

        Xiahou Dun held her breath to wait for the right timing. This was the longest time she had ever waited. Meanwhile, a drop of nervous sweat slided down from her forehead, dripping onto the ground——

        “Now!”

        Xiahou Dun tightened all her muscles to give her most deadly blow to Guan Yu——

        Clank! Guan Yu blocked the strike with her Crescent Blade.

        “Looks like I’ll never see you again...Cao Cao…”

        The moment when their weapons made contact, Xiahou Dun smiled bitterly. Next second, an arrow was shot into her leg. When she tried to step back, she missed a Guan Yu’s attack. 

        “AH——!”

        Xiahou Dun moaned as she got her left arm slashed by the Crescent Blade. Still, she managed to defend herself by thrusting her spear at Guan Yu. When she fell back to the shore, she saw Lü Bu coming from the woods, and Sun Quan’s navy was about to arrive. All her soldiers died in the battle. At this moment, her fate was sealed.

        “I lose...But...I won’t die for nothing...This is for Cao Cao and his crusade...All of you will go to hell with me!”

        The severely wounded Xiahou Dun managed to stand up and took off her eye patch, revealing a spooky white sphere with crimson runes in her left eye socket.

        “Come out now, demon! It’s your party time!” Xiahou Dun laughed crazily.

        A creepy pulse surged from her left eye to her body, inducing some kind of power hidden inside. The power corrupted half of her body into a monstrous creature in just the blink of an eye. After the transformation, she waved the monstrous arm to smash all the present soldiers!

        “Cao Cao...Don’t worry...I’ll never forget my mission to protect you no matter what I’ve become…”

        Tears of caring and sorrow quietly rolled down from her intact right eye...
