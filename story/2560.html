        <h1>Steerer of the Wind - Lü Bu</h1>
        <p>
                With sand wafting on the battlefield, the air grew tenser as silence reigned. Holding their breaths, both sides concentrated—Boom! Lü Bu dashed forward after a kick of his leg, causing a huge cyclone with fire. His halberd darted right towards Celestial Supremacy with an aura of purple and red. Yet, Celestial Supremacy reduced its force with a roundhouse kick. Unexpectedly, two poker cards came at him, forcing him to take a few steps back.

        A huge flaming claw plunged down the landing spot of Celestial Supremacy, trapping him underneath. Just when it was about to release flames and burn him into ashes, a gust of wind containing Earth elements snuffed out the flames. With his palm facing upwards and pushing against the giant claw, Celestial Supremacy was not crushed into minced meat. When the Queen of Hearts went forward to pursue him, her eyes met the ones of  Celestial Supremacy.

        ‘I won’t let anyone hurt the father of my child!’ yelled the Queen of Hearts.
‘He is getting out of control. There will be disastrous consequences if we don’t stop him now.’ Hearing the cold words of Celestial Supremacy, the Queen of Hearts immediately turned around and looked, only to find a mischievous purple light came from Lü Bu’s body.

        Following the light, his pale purple hair grew longer and fluttered in the wind like the mane of a lion. He threw his head back and let out a wild laugh. Then he started wreaking his raging power while the unstoppable murderous desire kept gnawing at his mind.

        The Queen of Hearts knew that Celestial Supremacy was telling the truth so she shouted at Lü Bu desperately. As though he heard her call, Lü Bu was startled. However, he then turned his neck at a horribly strange angle; his eyes were shining crimson with killing intent…

        At that moment, the Queen of Hearts could hear a child’s laughter, which sent a chill over her heart when it crossed with the one of Lü Bu. The murderous desire had taken over Lü Bu’s mind; the lust of slaughter drove him to conjure his powers and dash towards the Queen of Hearts!

        ‘Why…’
        ‘GO!’

        As Celestial Supremacy pushed aside the giant claw, he saved the Queen of Hearts, who was staggered. A blast of purple pneuma hit the place where they had stood and smashed the ground to rubble. No matter how the Queen of Hearts shouted his name, Lü Bu still couldn’t regain his consciousness. The rampant murderous desire turned into blades of wind and slashed in all directions. Yet, his eyes never stopped following the two.

        ‘This day has finally come… So there’s no choice just like the last time?’ As the Queen of Hearts looked at her locket in which she had placed her daughter’s portrait, she clasped it tightly in her palm, showing a will of determination.

        Under her control, warm flames slowly came out from her huge claws, prepared to meet the approaching Lü Bu. ‘Then let me wake you up with my life!’

        The purple pneuma blasted away the giant claws. With his eyes gleaming savagely, Lü Bu couldn’t recognize the woman in front of him; he even wielded his halberd and stuck it towards the Queen of Hearts! Slash! Blood splattered. The Queen put her arms around Lü Bu while the halberd gouged through her chest.

        Only until then did Lü Bu come back to his senses; he looked at the dripping blood in shock. The warmth of her embrace slid into his heart and drove away that cold blue ball of light. As soon as Lü Lingshuang separated from his body, his murderous desire subsided in an instant.

        Both of them fell to the ground. Blood key oozing from her wound. The crimson that Lü Bu had been obsessed with now became something that wrenched his heart. Kneeling on the ground, Lü Bu held the Queen of Hearts in his arm. Gasping breathlessly, her face was terribly pale which made the claret on the corner of her mouth unpleasantly eye-catching.

        With his hands clenching hers, profound remorse welled up in Lü Bu’s heart. Until that moment, he still couldn’t believe what he had done. On contrary, the Queen of Hearts gave him a faint smile, with tenderness filling her eyes. She then reached out her hand and lightly caressed Lü Bu’s face with her fingers whose tips were so icy cold that broke his heart.

        ‘Take care…Jackie for me…’

        The moment the Queen of Hearts closed her eyes, Lü Bu lamented hysterically at the sky; he could hardly control himself for a long while. Celestial Supremacy, who had seen everything, shook his head with a sigh. Then Changxi came before him and asked for his instruction while handing him the celestial ropes.

        The celestial gods tied Lü Bu up. Just before they were going to take him to the Heavenly Kingdom, Lü Bu saw the entrance to Wonderland was opened. From the hole came the voice of Alice, telling the residents to carry the Queen’s body back to Wonderland…


        Heavenly Kingdom

        ‘Darn you, gods, I will not succumb!’ Tied up tightly by the celestial ropes, Lü Bu raised his head and scolded, with his red eyes staring at Yuanshi Tianzun, who was standing on the altar. While all the celestial gods were looking at him, Celestial Supremacy couldn’t help sighing. He was once his strongest opponent, yet now had fallen…

        ‘Master, we shall eliminate this man, or else there will be only disasters!’ Changxi advised Yuanshi Tianzun respectfully.

        ‘Yeah…’

        ‘He should die…’

        ‘He doesn’t deserve to live…’

        All the celestial gods agreed with Changxi.

        ‘Quiet!’ After letting out a shout, Tongtian Jiaozhu walked to the altar and went down on his knees.

        ‘Jiaozhu…’ Shen Gongbao, who was standing aside, wanted to step forward yet he was stopped by Jiang Ziya.

        ‘Tianzun, please let him go.’ Tongtian Jiaozhu begged Yuanshi Tianzun but the latter did not yield an inch.

        ‘You know that’s impossible.’ stated Yuanshi Tianzun mercilessly.

        ‘I’d sacrifice my life for him!’ Tongtian Jiaozhu raised his Divine Brush and thrust it at his head, but Celestial Supremacy grabbed his arm and stopped him.

        ‘Brother, he’s not worth it!’ For the first time, Celestial Supremacy called Tongtian Jiaozhu as his brother out of respect. He then let go of Tongtian Jiaozhu’s hand and bowed to Yuanshi Tianzun.

        ‘Tianzun, may I make the call?’

        ‘Sure.’ Yuanshi Tianzun knew that Celestial Supremacy would remain his impartiality for he held the deepest hatred to Lü Bu, deeper than anyone else there. As Celestial Supremacy walked towards Lü Bu, he untied the latter with a snap of his finger. Falteringly, Lü Bu stood up.

        ‘Defeat me and you shall go!’ Celestial Supremacy said to Lü Bu,

        ‘Hahaha… Ahahaha…’ Lü Bu replied to him with a wild yet sardonic laugh.

        ‘Celestial Supremacy, I, Lü Bu, once stood at the top of the world; now I’ve fallen low to where I need your mercy to live! I loathe everything, everything that happened to me!’

        ‘The losers in Wonderland shall take good care of Jackie. Jackie, I fail you as your father! Hearty, I’m coming with you!’ With a long howl, Lü Bu stood in front of the altar, yet the celestial gods all knew that the Warlord’s breath had stopped eternally. Light drizzle started to fall. In the utter silence where only the sound of rain could be heard, Celestial Supremacy gave Lü Bu a salute.

        ‘Lü Bu, you have earned my respect!’

        ‘When Lü Bu lived, I hated him down to the marrow of my bones; but when he dies, I languish over his demise,’ said Celestial Supremacy - Taishang Laojun.</p>
