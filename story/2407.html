        <h1>Simon & Lagann</h1>
        <p>
        A teenager born in Giha Village, a subterranean civilization on Earth.

Despite his introversion and timidity, Simon shows calm judgment and outstanding digging skills.

To search for novelties in daily life, he has been working hard on digging, which is not understood by the peers in the village.  Therefore, he is also known as "Simon the Digger".

Since the loss of his parents, Simon has been looked after by Kamina in the village. He has always looked up to Kamina, calling him "brother" due to their close bonding.

One day, Simon found an important drill-like key named “Core Drill” during the digging and activated Gunmen "Lagann". Encouraged by Kamina, he became the pilot of “Lagann” and stepped on an adventure with his brother.

Although "Lagann" is small in size, its combat power is affected by Simon's mental state and Power of Spiral. The drill of "Lagann" at the lower body can also be combined with other Gunmen.
