                “We are already...already partners.  We shall refer to each other as dear.  I shall call you dear Hsiao-Yao, and you should call me dear Yue-Ru!”


        Lin Yue-Ru was born into a prominent family.  Having been spoiled by her father, she was capricious and stubborn.  Yet, Li Hsiao-Yao and his sword made sure this was not the case.  She admired Li Hsiao-Yao’s just virtues and was therefore willing to search for Zhao Ling-Er by his side.  Yue-Ru and Li Hsiao-Yao adventured across the martial world, dealing out justice.  However, Yue-Ru could see that Ling-Er and Li Hsiao-Yao shared a relationship more than friends.  Hence, she never told him what she felt and kept her confused feelings in her heart...</p>
