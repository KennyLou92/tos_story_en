        <h1>Cutting Bells - Suzuko</h1>
        <p>        In the depths of a lush forest, there was a secluded mountain cave. A young girl and a white puppy approached silently from a distance, taking cover behind the nearest tree trunk. 

        Putting her head round the tree trunk, the girl placed two fingers close to her right eye and began drawing a sigil in the air. As she completed the sigil, it shimmered with a golden light, allowing her right eye to see clearly into the dark depths of the cave. Inside the cave were numerous glistening spiderwebs, intricately woven into a dense network. Hanging below the webs were several cocooned figures, while beneath them was a giant spider youkai with the upper body of a woman. Holding a lifeless body—one whose eyes wide open, staring into the void with an eerie stillness—in her arms, the youkai continuously spun silk to encase it in a cocoon.

        Appalled by the cruel sight, the girl undid her spell. Her face grew solemn as she murmured softly, “So it’s true…The missing villagers have all been abducted and killed by that youkai in the cave.”

        The girl’s name was Suzuko. When Suzuko was little, an evil man murdered her parents while she and Woofy, an white inuyoukai, miraculously survived. They were later rescued by Shigeharu, an Onmyōji who became Suzuko’s master, teaching her the Onmyōdō of five elements.

        To avenge her parents’ death, Suzuko diligently honed her techniques, taking on various missions to gain experience and broaden her knowledge. A few days ago, she received a request from a small village where several villagers had gone missing. The witnesses claimed they had been abducted by a youkai, hoping Suzuko could save them.

        And so, Suzuko and Woofy set out from the mountain to visit the village. Following the scent left behind on the belongings of the missing villagers, they tracked it to this very cave. As expected, they found the spider youkai responsible for the missing villagers.

        ‘Woof! Should I go fight that spider youkai?’ Woofy’s voice brought Suzuko back from her thoughts.

        She shook her head and reached into her pocket, retrieving four small golden bells held between her fingers. It was a technique Suzuko had created herself to exact revenge against her parents’ murderer, Douman Ashiya. But for some reason, her technique was not complete—it always failed whenever she tried to use it.

        “This is the perfect opportunity to test my Golden Bell Technique,”  Suzuko whispered, calming her breath while channeling her power through her entire body. As she sensed the energy surging within her, she lunged toward the cave and rushed toward the entrance like a soaring swallow. Catching the spider youkai off guard, she hurled the golden bell in her right hand.

        With a crisp ringing sound, the four golden bells shot toward the spider youkai from different directions, releasing a fierce aura that subdued it. The spider youkai, of course, refused to be restrained. While swinging its appendages violently, it let out a ferocious roar, revealing its true barbaric nature which only fueled Suzuko’s hatred.

        ‘It’s all these abhorrent youkais’ fault. They killed my parents, and I shall exterminate them all,’ Suzuko thought, her heart filled with overwhelming resentment. For a fleeting second, her eyes flashed with a similar ferocity to that of the youkai.

        For some unknown reason, the four golden bells suddenly trembled, and then exploded with a loud bang. Once again, Suzuko’s technique failed at the critical moment, just like it had during her practise in the past. But this time, it was different as she was fighting a true youkai. 

        As Suzuko’s technique failed, the spider youkai regained its freedom. Filled with boiling rage, it raised its sharp appendage, ready to strike Suzuko, who had been immobilized due to the backlash from her failed technique. Just as the bladed appendage was about to land on her body…

        “Suzuko! Suzuko!” A white figure suddenly dashed forward, forcefully pushing the youkai aside. Relentless, the youkai extended its other appendage and swung it toward the white puppy, knocking it away. Unable to avoid the youkai’s retaliation, Woofy crashed heavily into a wall. Blood sipped through its mouth as it helplessly slumped onto the ground.

        “Woofy!” Suzuko’s eyes widened in shock. She hurriedly crawled over to Woofy’s side, drawing its listless body into her arms. Woofy opened its eyes and looked at Suzuko. Relieved to see her unharmed, its mouth curled up into a feeble smile as it let out a soft bark.

        “Suzuko… You’re okay… I’m…relieved…” Woofy weakly expressed.

        “Yes, I’m okay, and you will be too. I’ll take you back home now and Master will heal you!” After saying those words, Suzuko turned to leave the cave, only to be stopped by a swift attack that came from the side. Fortunately, Suzuko managed to leap away just in time to avoid it, witnessing a deep pit being formed on the spot where she had stood seconds ago.

        It was the spider youkai. As soon as it recovered from the impact and rose to its feet again, it pounced toward Suzuko with a ferocious cry, snarling, “I won’t let you leave alive! Now surrender and become one of my cocoons!”

        ‘I have no time to waste. I need to get Woofy to Master as soon as possible! I have to protect Woofy!’ Suzuko thought with absolute determination.

        Suzuko once again took out her golden bells and hurled it toward the youkai. The four golden bells rang out again, but this time, they did not explode like before. Instead, they burst into blinding light that captured the struggling youkai.

        “ARGHHH!” The spider youkai let out a miserable scream as it perished in Suzuko’s powerful blow.

        As soon as Suzuko successfully quelled the spider youkai, she hurried back home, bringing Woofy to her master, Shigeharu, for treatment. Fortunately, Woofy’s injuries were not severe, and with timely treatment, it would only take a few days of rest for it to fully recover.

        It was only then that Suzuko found relief and took the opportunity to share her doubts with her master. She asked, “Master, why did my Golden Bell Technique work this time?”

        “The Onmyōdō of five elements requires a clear and pure heart, free from hatred and resentment. You technique failed because your intentions are clouded,” Shigeharu explained with profound words. “Yet, empathy can unlock one’s hidden potential. Your strong desire to protect Woofy solidified your will, leading to the success of the technique.”

        “...I still don’t get it,” Suzuko replied dejectedly.

        With a warm smile, Shigeharu gently placed his hand on his beloved disciple’s head and said tenderly, “Don’t worry, my child. You will figure it out one day.”</p>
