        <h1>Sworded Samurai - Minamoto no Yoshitsune</h1>
        <p>
                Yoshitsune’s power was greatly amplified after he got the two swords, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori. To test his true power, he started wandering around the Tarones, looking for the best battlefield for him. One day, he found a troop of God soldiers patrolling, so he drew his swords and charged at them.

        Wielding the pairs of dark swords, Yoshitsune stabbed a God soldier with such an incredible speed that the soldier collapsed before he could even pull out his weapon. However, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori were still disgruntled; their voices kept whispering in Yoshitsune’s head.

        “Too weak,” said Imanotsurugi.
        “Too slow,” said Usumidori.
        “How can you defeat Lü Bu if that’s all you got?” Together they sounded like two haunting ghosts.

        The name of Lü Bu ignited a dark flame in Yoshitsune’s heart. Despite the fact that he was resurrected by the demonic blood of Lü Bu, he also fell in the palm of the latter’s hand because of it and became his lackey.

        Resentful, Yoshitsune broke free from the demonic blood and found the dark swords of Impulsion. Still, he couldn’t defeat Lü Bu, who didn’t even regard him as an evenly matched enemy.

        “Then, what am I…”

        ‘Lü-Bu! Ahhh!’ In Yoshitsune’s eyes, the soldiers before him all took on the appearance of Lü Bu. With a mounting killing intent, an inexhaustible flow of evil pneuma came from his body. Each swing of his swords was twice as fast as before.

        Growling in a low voice, Yoshitsune fended off a soldier’s long spear with the long sword in his left hand while the short sword in his right hand abruptly moved and gashed another soldier’s face. Like a warrior that had gone off the deep end, he knocked down the remaining soldiers one after one.

        Yoshitsune’s slaughter only came to an end when all the soldiers dropped. As he looked at his bloodstained hands, a gleam of madness rose in his eyes.

        “I’m almost there… I just need to be a little bit stronger. Then I shall be able to take down Lü Bu.”

        Yoshitsune’s desire to defeat Lü Bu gradually became a dreadful obsession. He could always hear Lü Bu’s mockery of him, even though he was never around him. When he returned to the White Queen’s castle, he looked accursed, pondering on something with a stream of evil pneuma hovering around him.

        ‘Yoshitsune!’

        ‘Snowdrop… What is it?’

        ‘Yoshitsune… I’ve called you many times but you didn’t respond to me. I’m deeply worried about you.’

        ‘I… I’m just a bit tired… I’m fine.’

        Intending to wash his face, Yoshitsune then walked to the bathroom in the castle only to see the pale reflection of himself in the mirror.

        Shortly after, the reflection of him in the mirror distorted and turned into Lü Bu.

        ‘Lü…Bu… AHHH!’

        “You’re too weak,” the voice of Lü Bu echoed in his head.

        The White Queen, who heard Yoshitsune’s roar, came to the bathroom only to find him hitting the mirror with his fists like mad.

        ‘Ahhhhhhhh!!’ As an overwhelming gust of evil pneuma surged from Yoshitsune’s body, all the glasses in the bathroom shattered in a split second.

        Not knowing what had happened, the White Queen could only take him in her arms and said, ‘Yoshitsune, I’m here.’

        The warm embrace brought Yoshitsune back to his senses. With his eyes regaining their clearness, Yoshitsune, who wanted to ease the White Queen’s worries, said, ‘I was just a bit annoyed, but I’m okay now.’

        Little did they know that the two dark swords, Imanotsurugi and Usumidori, were expressing their utter disdain for Yoshitsune outside the bathroom.

        ‘Is such a weak man worth to be called as our master?’ Imanotsurugi asked Usumidori.
        ‘No.’
        ‘Then, it only makes sense if we take his body for our own good, right?’</p>
