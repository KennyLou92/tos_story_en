        <h1>Beacon of Stars - Zi Wei</h1>
        <p>17.3 Northern Dipper Story Ch. 1

        At the northernmost of Heavenly Kingdom, there was a holy mountain, where a red-haired girl was sitting at the peak. As a meteor swept across the sky, she gave an excited look.

        “Meteor! Let me hear the wishes of the mortals...Lose weight...Meet Mr. Right…” The girl went from enthusiastic to dejected, lying on the ground like a needy child.

        “Boring wishes again! URGHHH! Save me from this boredom!” She yelled.

        This grumpy girl here was Zi Wei, the leader of the Northern Dipper. Zi Wei and the other six members took shifts to record the stars movement and mortals’ wishes. Only this job was straightforward like a flatline.

        “I don’t wanna stay here at all! I’m destined to kill demons!” While Zi Wei was fantasizing an adventure, a tiny black creature was sneaking from behind. Then it pounced——

        “WHOA——!”

        Lying on the ground, Zi Wei felt something pounce on her face, blocking her vision. As she grabbed the thing reflectively, the creature made a sharp sound.

        “MEOW——!”

        “Is this...a cat?” Zi Wei thought.

        After a while of struggle, Zi Wei managed to get the creature off her face. Then she looked at the hostile glare in amber with the cat holding in her hands.

        “Hey kitty, why are you here?” Zi Wei looked at the black cat and asked, which responded with a yawn. She scratched her cheek and said, “right. Of course you won’t talk back.”

        “Put down my mythical beast NOW!”

        Zi Wei was startled by a deafening yell. Next second, a bionic man arrived at the scene, crashing a small dent out the land next to Zi Wei

        “Wheeze. Hey Li. I’m putting the kitty down now,” said Zi Wei as she let go of the cat. Landing safely with an agile flip, the cat playfully rolled in the small dent crushed by Li Tieguai.

        Covering half of his face, Li Tieguai explained grimly, “that would be very wrong of you if you think it’s just an ordinary cat. It’s the Devilish Feline of Immortality blessed by the glare of wicked god. It has the potential that beyond imagination!”

        Any sane person would have figured out that it was a total bullcrap made up by Li Tieguai; yet Zi Wei believed every word he had said, for she had an “exceptionally creative” mindset. And she looked at the black cat with an admiring look.

        “The Devilish Feline of Immortality! It’s awesome!”

        “Clever girl. Tomorrow I’ll be battling a monster with it!”

        “Monster?”

        “There’s an octopus monster raging at the east coast lately, hurting fishermen nearby. Sister He promised the fishermen that the monster would be eliminated by tomorrow afternoon, and I’ll be going as well...Oh, it’s getting late now. I gotta go back for preparation. Bye my dear friend!”

        Looking at the leaving Li Tieguai, there was a raging ambition inside Zi Wei, a longing for the unconventional life.

        “I want to be like him, kicking asses and saving people…”

        Then Zi Wei made a decision.

        At the morning before dawn, a group of seven lurked in the bushes at the coastal area, observing an octopus on the shore. The octopus had the size of a battleship, which was seemingly at rest. 

        “This is the octopus monster Li mentioned that messing around!” Zi Wei mumbled excitedly, while the other six Xians remained drowsy. 

        “He Xian'gu will recognise us if we take down this monster before they do! Let’s go everyone!” Zi Wei jumped out of the cover and attacked the octopus.

        “Orgh——!” The pain had woken up the octopus. The irritated monster smacked Zi Wei with its limb, and she barely blocked its attack——

        “Tan Lang, help me out——Huh? Po Jun, where’s everybody else?”

        “Tan Lang said he had a date. The rest of them are either sleeping or finding something squishy,” explained Po Jun, the man with an intimidating face.

        “Wh-what! So now it’s just two of us going against this monster…” Turning around, Zi Wei stared at the enraged octopus, which was smashing its limbs at Zi Wei.

        “Am I gonna be killed by octopus limbs...That’s a kind of special way to die…” Zi Wei braced for death with her eyes closed, but she didn’t feel the pain as she expected. Instead, a deafening noise sounded——

        “Li!”

        “Right on time,” said the smiling Li Tieguai, shielding Zi Wei from the monster.

        “That thing is about to attack again!”

        “Don’t worry. ‘Cause she’s here.”

        Zi Wei didn’t get Li Tieguai at first, but then the enormous lotus in the sky solved the mystery——the glamorous He Xian’gu riding her lotus and subduing the hostile octopus.

        “Ew! This thing is so slimy!” He Xian’gu looked at the subdued octopus with goosebump. When everything was under control, she jumped down from the lotus and walked toward Zi Wei and Po Jun with a grim face.

        “How dare you rookie girl——”

        Yet Zi Wei had already distracted by the horrible image behind He Xian’gu——the subdued octopus aiming its siphon at He Xian’gu.

        “Watch out!” Zi Wei’s warning came in too late.

        Tremendous amount of ink was ejected at the dressed-up He Xian’gu, and it wasn’t just a small hit. Witnessing the whole tragedy, the presenting Xians were stunned. The awkwardness remained until He Xian’gu broke the silence.

        “SEVEN STARS OF NORTHERN DIPPER!”

        The fully, totally stained He Xian’gu let out a deafening yell. “Your negligence just caused a catastrophe!  You’re now expelled from Heavenly Kingdom until you make one hundred wishes of mortals come true!”

        “Wh-What!” Zi Wei didn’t see this coming.

        Although this wasn’t the outcome that Zi Wei had expected, it did make her wish of being unconventional come true in some ways. LOL</p>
