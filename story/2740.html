        <h1>Adroit Craftsmanship - Galahad</h1>
        <p>Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.1

        'This kind of soulless bladesmithing is the greatest insult to bladesmiths. Darn it, this black magic. I must crush it!' Galahad shouted furiously.

        Tilting his head, Galahad’s father gave her a cold gaze that sent a strange feeling to her. He dropped the smith hammer and took the claymore aside instead. With his face preoccupied and distorted by some kind of madness, he roared wildly, 'You don’t understand. This suit of dark metal armor is the best of a bladesmith! Galahad, if you’re not on the same page with me then show me if your heart as a bladesmith is stronger than mine!'

        'Forge every sword with all your heart. This is what you’ve taught me since I was small. So I’m gonna beat you with this faith and wake you up!' Galahad raised her hammer as she confronted her father.

        Under the fiery sparks, the father and daughter waited in bated breath. Suddenly, the father strode forward and swung his sword! Galahad struggled to defend yet the sheer force almost knocked the hammer out of her hands.

        Seeing his daughter’s discomfiture, the father showed no mercy with attacks that got even more vicious. Galahad was forced to retreat and felt the growing heat behind her back. The flames painted her father’s ferocious face red ——Her father forced her to the forge and there was no way out!

        'Is that all you got? Then you can never surpass me,' said the father with rage as if he didn’t realize that he was driving his daughter towards the forge fire. Madness was the only thing left in his eyes.

        As she looked at her father, Galahad’s eyes brimmed with tears. Struggling under her father’s pushes, she murmured with shivers, 'Father has always been my idol… The swords that father made with all his heart are the strongest… You’re the one that I thought I could never surpass... '

        A sign of wavering flashed across the father’s eyes.

        Galahad grasped the chance and immediately pushed her father back. Then she said with a firm tone, 'Because… I’ve seen my father's passion for bladesmithing! He takes pride in forging and will never succumb to dark metal… The father I used to know will never do such things! '

        'Come back, father! Retrieve your heart as a bladesmith!' shouted Galahad, as she swung her hammer and aimed for the weakness of his sword! 

        Clink! The sword and hammer made a clattering sound as they met——the sword cracked!

        'How could that be...' Looking at the broken pieces on the ground, Galahad’s father was flabbergasted.


        “I can’t compare to my father in terms of strength but I know better about my father's work than anyone else, including its weakness!” Staring at her father’s dark metal armor, Galahad locked her eye on a point and  flung her hammer at it.

        The armor smashed into pieces and fell onto the ground with a click. As Galahad put down her arms pantingly, she looked at her father who was brought to his knees.

        The madness in his eyes was gone and they regained their tenderness as in the old days. Galahad dropped her giant hammer, ran to her father and hugged him like a little girl, saying, 'You… you’re back… Father, I miss you so much!' 

        Holding each other, the father and the daughter burst into tears until a figure came——Merlin patted Galahad on her shoulders and said, 'I’m glad you’re both safe! Since Morgan le Fay had fled, let’s go and look for the clues for the Vile Core! '

        Yet, Galahad’s father said with a grim expression, 'It’s too late… The Vile Core  is in the hand of Mordred.'</p>
