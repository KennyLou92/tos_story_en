        <h1>Buzzer of Cacophony - Yvonne</h1>
        <p>
                Lingering with pleasant music all year round, this school specialized in training students to use magic by performing music instruments.

        On the annual performance, the headmaster was enjoying the students’ performances enthusiastically.

        Some of the students sang beautiful slow songs, making the plants in the garden blossom; some played violin, turning the pond into an uplifting fountain.

        “Yvonne? Yvonne! It’s your showtime!”

        The class instructor had to shake Yvonne hard in order to wake this drooling girl up from her nap.

        As the sleepy Yvonne stepped on to the stage, her baby pink pigtails moved up and down with the rhythm of her pace. She had a chubby face with a cute facial profile. 

        “I’m Yvonne, and I’m here to perform a song composed by myself, ‘The Hunger Anthem’.”

        Yvonne’s sweet voice made the headmaster anticipate her performance.

        The instrument Yvonne used was made of five broken cooking pots and a rusted spatula. As her performance began, she bashed the pots with the spatula hard.

        “CLANK CLANK CLANK CRASH CRASH CRASH!”

        The cacophonous noise was like an attack to the hearing of all students and teachers. Meanwhile, the blossom withered and the water in the pond dried up. When the ground started cracking, everyone fled the hall with their ears covered.

        “STOP! What in the realm are you doing? That is a disaster!” The headmaster yelled.

        “I was merely expressing my mood when I was hungry and the teacher refused to let me go,” said Yvonne.

        The class instructor dragged her off the stage as fast as he could. 

        “Are you crazy to bring pots onto the stage? They are no music instruments at all!” The class instructor was furious.

        “I thought you said even the nicest instrument would only produce disharmonious noise in my hand? That’s why I created my disastrous instrument!” Yvonne answered assuredly.

        “Shut up! You better behave yourself, or you’ll never get to graduate!”

        At night, Yvonne was tossing and turning on her bed.

        “Why? It has been the same since I was small. Everyone runs away whenever I sing. I’ve invested much effort in playing music instruments, but everyone says my music is disastrous. After all, I’ve put all my emotions into it! Am I really not born for it? Ugh. This is annoying! I should go take a walk and get some inspiration for my graduation project.”

        And then Yvonne got out of her bed and left the room with a lamp.

        Striding along the hallway, Sonata reminded himself not to make any sound in order to avoid getting caught.


        The safe room for valuable music scores located at the next corner. Approaching his destination, Sonata got his skeleton key ready, preparing to break in at his fastest.

        “Whoa!”

        Sonata bumped into a pink-haired girl in pajamas around the corner.

        Just when Sonata was going to cover Yvonne’s mouth, she did the same thing one step faster. 

        “Please don’t shout! If I get caught sneaking out of bed, I’ll be expelled!”

        Yvonne was relieved when Sonata nodded at her.

        “Thank you, Mr. Thief, but thefting is wrong. You should go home,” said Yvonne.

        “I ain’t no thief! I’m just searching for the music of my family treasure,” Sonata clarified his purpose here.

        “My name is Sonata, and I’m travelling the realm to search for “Whisper of Monesis” composed by my ancestor Zana. I heard that your school kept an ancient mysterious sheet music, so I wanna see if that is our treasure.”

        Yvonne was impressed. “You’re persistent! Too bad that the music is locked inside the headmaster’s office. You won’t be able to get in. But I practiced it once, so how about letting me play it for you?”

        “That would be great! Thank you.”

        Yvonne then took Sonata to the practice room, where the walls were enchanted to sound-proof.

        With a flute in her hands, Yvonne performed the most unsettling and cacophonous tune that Sonata had ever heard, but she couldn’t be more indulging in her performance.

        When the song ended, Sonata applauded.

        “Thank you. Now I know that it’s not “Whisper of Monesis” I’m looking for,” said Sonata.

        Yvonne blushed for embarrassment.

        “I get it. My disastrous music has confused you. You should go to the headmaster’s office and search for it!”

        “It’s not like that. With the effort I’ve spent in studying “Whisper of Monesis”, I can easily tell if that’s the right song. Besides, I don’t think your performance is disastrous, for I can feel your passion in the tune. It’s more authentic than those pleasant but soulless tunes,” Sonata expressed his genuine thought.

        At this moment, Sonata stood up and said to Yvonne, “farewell, Yvonne. May your passion towards music never fade.”

        On the graduation performance, Yvonne performed a song named “Adventurous Anthem” with an iron pot, a glass bottle and an empty bamboo stick. The deafening music volume was a soul-shocking blast to every audience. Some of the students even screamed, but not because her music was too awful. When their screams fused with the disharmonic rhythm, they felt an unprecedented pleasure. At the end of the performance, everything was destroyed. The bamboo stick burst; the glass bottle shattered; the pot cracked; the ceiling of the hall crumbled.
        The headmaster announced while rubbing his almost-deaf ears.

        “Congratulations Yvonne, you’ve passed. Now leave the academy and spread your wings!”

        With the blessing of the headmaster, Yvonne left the school confidently.
