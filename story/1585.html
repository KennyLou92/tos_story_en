        <h1>Leona the Silent Ikari Warrior</h1>
        <p>
        Leona is one of the Eight Orochi Dependants. She possesses extraordinary power derived from Orochiâ€™s blood. When she was small, she underwent the Riot of Blood and accidentally slaughtered her parents. She was later adopted by the commander who came to her village to investigate the incident. He taught her assassination and raised her to be an outstanding soldier. Whenever Orochi approaches her, she will undergo the Riot of Blood.  Due to her past, she often keeps her emotions in check. Later, her mental state becomes stable with the help of the new family she has found with the Ikari mercenaries. She slowly opens her heart and acknowledges her past to create her future.</p>
