        <h1>Taizou Hasegawa</h1>
        <p>The symbol of MADAO (short for “a totally hopeless old guy” in Japanese).

He went on the path of MADAO after he beat Prince Hata, his target of protection, when he was still the Director-General of the Immigration Bureau.

Losing his job and his wife, he is a man of misfortune who cannot get anything done.

However, even someone like MADAO still holds a deep-seated belief inside him. Unfortunately, no one has noticed that so far.</p>
