        <h1>Fuhrer King Bradley</h1>
        <p>Commander-in-chief of the Amestris national military, who wears an eyepatch over his left eye. 

His class is Fuhrer, the top seat. 

After many distinguished services on the battlefield, he took hold of the parliament and the regime while still in his 40s and climbed up to become the nation’s dictator.

While majestic and dignified, he is a strange man with an easygoing posture. 

However, his true identity is the homunculus of “wrath,” prepared 60 years ago as the final piece in Father’s plan.

He has the “most powerful eye” that uses superhuman kinetic vision to see every move of all things, and wields five swords to attack the opponent at tremendous speed. 

Furthermore, his base is human, so he ages unlike the other homunculi. He has a wife and a son, Selim.
