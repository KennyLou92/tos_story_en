        <h1>Harrowing Bitterness - Mastema</h1>
        <p>Origin of Demons - Supreme Reckoning Story Ch. 4

        Mastema wanted to overthrow Belial, yet her plan was discovered long ago by the prince. As a result, she fell into Belial’s trap which captured her soul in a container. Her mind was plunged into turmoil until that spellbinding man came and brought her back to the light one day.

        “Hmm!” With the sudden return of her five senses, Mastema was overwhelmed by the swarming information that gave her a headache. Just when she was racked with excruciating pain, a dark shadow fell over her. Then she heard a low and mellow male voice saying, “No rush. Your soul just returned to its body. You still need time to get used to it.”

        Squinting her eyes that were watering because of the pouring light, she looked at the shadow and finally recognized him. “...Lord Baal! Did you save me? This body…” 

        “The is a new body specially rebuilt for you. The one before has been destroyed and can’t be used anymore.”

        “Oh, is it…” Mastema thought she would be frustrated or apoplectic, yet her heart was instead calm and unfeeling. Now she only found it ridiculous when she looked back at her past obsession with Balial.

        “...Why did you save me?” Getting hold of herself, she looked Baal in the eye.

        “You should know better than me.” Baal bent over, lifted her chin with his hand, and murmured softly like a whisper in a lover’s ear, “Bring Belial to me, daughter of one of the seven aristocrats, Mastema.”

        Without any second thought, Mastema knelt on one knee. Holding Baal’s hand, she kissed it lightly with submission and said, “As you wish, Lord Baal.”

        Later, Mastema secretly contacted her subordinates before and talked the other nobles into compliance with the aristocratic name of her father. Then, she laid a trap one night, waiting for her prey named Belial to come.

        As the door of the elegant mansion was pushed open, a young man with green hair walked in. When he walked to the parlor, he was stunned by the dozen demons dressed in noble standing in front of him. But soon he hid his surprise and wore an arrogant and wilful smile.

        “What is everybody doing in my house at this late hour of night? We’re having a war against the gods tomorrow. It’d be better for you to get rest earlier, or else I’m afraid it may sap your strength.”

        “Humph! You insolent kid,” a middle-aged man with a ponytail stepped forward and said disdainfully. “If we don’t come today, I’m afraid we will be dead tomorrow without even knowing why.”

        “...What is that supposed to mean?” Belial scowled and put his hands behind his back. “Slandering a royal’s name for no reason is considered a felony. Now apologize to me and I shall spare you.”

        “Stop making excuses! It seems like you need a lesson to know what is right!” Just when the demon with a ponytail was about to draw the sword on his waist, a hand stopped him.

        “Wait.” A female voice familiar to Belial sounded. Incredulous, Belial abruptly turned and looked over. The moment he saw that figure, he gritted his teeth and growled, “Mastema!”

        “Yes, it’s me.” Without the animosity heaped in the past, Mastema showed a sharply posh aura under her gorgeous patrician gown. “What a surprise, isn’t it? I never thought that I could return to this world again after you took my soul away as I saw your trade with the gods.”

        “You’re lying! I never traded with the gods!” Belial refuted loudly. However, the cold gaze of all the other demons made him realize that they didn’t want his rebuttal nor would they let him.

        “It’s you again… You come to stop me again. I won’t let you get away with this!” A flame called rage suddenly rose from Belial’s heart. As he channeled his power, a green light appeared on his fists.

        He then focused and pounced on Mastema in a fierce and imposing manner. Some demons tried to stop him yet they were all knocked down by Belial. When the attack was about to hit Mastema, the corners of her mouth lifted. The next moment, a burst of monumental power broke out and shot directly at Belial’s body. Although he twisted his body and avoided fatal injuries, still he could not escape fate with him covered in blood. 

        “This isn’t your power… Who… Who gave you the power…” Belial knelt on the ground feebly; his right eye was closed because of bleeding so he could only stare at Mastema with his left eye.

        “Belial, who else has such immense power that can save me,” said Mastema with a scornful laugh. “You should’ve known the answer.”

        Belial immediately knew the answer. Then, as if he had sensed something, he abruptly raised his head and saw the man walking down the stairs—it was Baal, his elder brother.

        “Long time no see, my dear little brother,” said Baal with a smile and his hands behind his back.</p>
