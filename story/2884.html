        <h1>Tapestry of Stars -  Aether</h1>
        <p>        “Lord Khaos!” Aether rushed to the end of the realm of gods with the other gods, only to witness their crumbling new home and the wounded Khaos kneeling wearily on the ground. Her heart tightened as she hurried forward, offering a helping hand to Khaos.

        Unexpectedly, Khaos pushed her away. As his gaze flicked over the gods around, he declared loudly, “That filthy human destroyed the home of all gods. All elements we extracted had flowed back to the land. To rebuild our home, I now command you all to retrieve the lost elements at all costs!”

        “Yes, Your Majesty!” All the gods responded in unison and left the realm of gods, heading toward the ground, except for Aether, who stood in calculating contemplation.

        ‘Not only do the human armies and the Xians are on the ground, but also the demons who are coveting the elemental powers. Our kind has already suffered considerable losses during the recent battle within the Enochian Tower. We may fall into a disadvantageous position among the three factions if we don’t reinforce our troops,’ she thought.

        Aether raised her head and looked toward a certain part of the Tarones as a decision was made in her mind. With a respectful bow, she proposed, “Lord Khaos, given the critical situation, I suggest we use the prototypes.”

        “The prototypes… You mean the mechanical soldiers you’ve created with your new powers?” asked Khaos closing his eyes wearily. Never had he imagined that he would be trapped in the depths of desperation because of those insignificant humans. It was no longer a good time for him to conceal his true powers. Thus, he nodded slowly and said, “Very well, execute your plan, Aether. Awaken them and eliminate all our enemies so that we can retrieve the lost elements and rebuild our realm.”

        “As you wish, Lord Khaos!” Aether replied loudly. She then mobilized her power and left the realm of gods, soaring through the sky until she reached a nearby ruin not far from the Enochian Tower.

        After walking through the overgrown grass and traversing a winding corridor through a narrow cave, Aether arrived at a vast altar where, astonishingly, the entire floor was missing. The scattered debris and broken pieces of stone revealed marks of a fierce battle in the past. Chilling winds slipped through the bottomless pits on the ground, sending shivers down one’s spine.

        Regardless of the unknown, Aether leaped into a pit without hesitation and descended into the expansive basement. Stepping on shards of stones and rubble, she came to the end of the corridor where a massive door stood. She pushed open the door, revealing a seemingly boundless room with an array of mechanical soldiers standing in silence as if waiting for someone to wake them.

        ‘It seems the intruder didn’t dare to disturb these mechanical soldiers.’ Aether thought, recalling the young dragon girl who had intruded the basement. The girl awakened her draconic bloodline during their confrontation. To protect herself, Aether decisively retreated and returned later with a troop of god soldiers. Yet, the girl had already left by then.

        Due to the escalating war between humans and gods, Aether had no choice but to hastily strengthen the seal before she left. She was relieved that the girl had not damaged the dormant mechanical soldiers in the hidden basement.

        “Now it is the time for them to serve us.” Soon after Aether woke from her reminiscence, she tightened her grip on her scepter and channeled her power, creating a stellar radiance. But just then, she sensed someone approaching so she stopped and turned, alertly gazing toward the empty doorway as she demanded, “Who’s there?” 

        “It’s me,  Lady Aether.” A mechanical voice echoed in the spacious room as a tall mechanical soldier emerged from the shadows. Despite its imposing stature, its movements were rather nimble, displaying a scholarly elegance.

        “...Dolu...” Aether whispered the mechanical soldier’s name. Dolu was one of the mechanical soldiers created by Aether herself, designed to guard the mechanical army in the hidden basement, which she believed had been destroyed by the young intruder. Yet, to her surprise, Dolu appeared to be unbroken except for some minor damage. Still, an eerie aura of oppression around Dolu caused Aether to instinctively heighten her vigilance.

        Unaware of Aether’s hostile intent, Dolu continued to speak in a cheerful voice, “Lady Aether, it has been a long time. May I ask what brings you here today?”

        “...I’m here to awaken the mechanical soldiers to save the world,” Aether answered.

        “To save the world… Gegege!” Dolu emitted a mocking laughter that was uncharacteristic of a mechanical soldier. The lights in its eyes began to flicker incessantly, vividly resembling a person doubled over in amusement. “Such a beautiful lie. You Holy Gods are truly despicable as you shamelessly destroy this lively realm just to create your so-called utopia.”

        “So, you know… Did that dragon girl tell you that?”Aether inquired.

        “No, she didn’t. Mother did,” said Dolu, whose tone carried absolute reverence, “Our great Mother showed me your true nature, and that’s why I won’t let you destroyers exploit our brethren!”

        “Humph! I don’t need your permission!” Aether mustered her power. The elemental power of the stars converged on her scepter and formed a formidable energy ball which she hurled fiercely toward Dolu.

        Dolu immediately raised its steel shield, conjuring a sturdy defensive barrier that blocked Aether’s attack while gathering the power of the origin on its free hand to unleash a strike toward Aether, who, however, saw through its move and evaded its counterattack with a light leap.

        With the clash of powers as a start, the goddess and the mechanical soldier engaged in an intense battle where thunderous explosions shook the earth as they exchanged blows. Yet, Aether’s attacks failed to break through Dolu’s barrier. As time passed, she found herself in a disadvantageous position while continuously evading Dolu’s assaults.

        ‘I can’t waste any more time. Lord Khaos is still waiting for me to bring back the mechanical soldiers.’         With her mind focused on her mission, Aether keenly observed Dolu’s movements, searching for an opening to end the battle. Finally, she found one.

        ‘Dolu has been avoiding the mechanical soldiers in the room lest it damages them. So, I shouldn’t be targeting Dolu, but the other mechanical soldiers!’

        Without hesitation, Aether turned around and sprinted toward the motionless mechanical soldiers in the center of the room. Simultaneously, she unleashed her godly power, gathering the most explosive energy ball her body could muster.

        “No! Not my brethren!” Even though Dolu knew it was Aether’s ploy, it did not have the heart to see harm befall its yet-to-awaken brethren. Thus, it withdrew its protective barrier and rushed toward the mechanical soldiers, using its own body as a shield against Aether’s attack.

        Boom!

        The impact reverberated throughout the room with an ear-splitting blare. Dolu’s body was torn apart, shattered into pieces. With only its severed head flying through the air, Dolu could only gaze weakly at the quietly standing unharmed mechanical soldiers which brought him a sense of relief.

        ‘My brethren are unharmed. Great—’ Dolu’s thought of relief abruptly stopped as Aether stomped on its severed head and crushed it. She sneered disdainfully, saying, “How dare you try to resist the Holy Gods. What a pathetic and weak creature.”

        Aether kicked Dolu’s remains aside, then once again mustered her power. Suspending herself in mid-air, she looked down upon the neatly arranged mechanical soldiers with a triumphant smile curling her lips. “Now, it is time for you to give everything to our mighty Lord Khaos!”</p>
