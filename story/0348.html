        <h1>The Queen of Sarmatians</h1>
        <p>
                For a long time, Circe had manipulated her magic to control the power of the forest around the capital, protecting the people inside...

        “Your Majesty, the artifact you request is deep within the forest heavily guarded by Demons.  We are not capable of fetching it. Please forgive us!”   A crowd of warriors knelt down before the king pleading for mercy.

        “So would you prefer to spend you life seeking that artifact, or would you rather be jailed for the rest of your life?”  The angry king’s words were carved into the heart of the warriors.  The one who stood in front glanced at Circe the queen.

        “Your Majesty, these warriors also protect our country.  We cannot imprison them all.  How about putting out a bounty, luring capable people to find it for us?”  Circe understood the warrior’s glance and cleverly spoke on their behalf.

        The king had long been infamous for his capriciousness.  Officials had reached a consensus with the queen: if the king refused to heed reasonable advice, the queen would step up.  The king did recognize his own shortcomings somewhat; if Circe’s recommendation did not deviate from his will, he would mostly agree with her.  Furthermore, the target this time was an artifact that could enhance Circe’s power in controlling the power of the forests.  Therefore, the officials did not dare complain.

        Three months passed.  A group of adventurers, with the artifact, entered the capital for the reward.  Not long later, the princess agreed to a martial tournament for a spouse.  Having joyous occasions happen in succession delighted the king.  He thought the country will forever be peaceful and prosperous; he could not have imagined that misfortune awaited...

        One of the adventurers had emerged victorious in the competition for the right to marry the princess.  The king was obstinate not to allow outside blood enter the royal family.  He even disregarded to his daughter’s wishes and locked the warrior in a prison.  The king’s concern about the bloodline was not only capricious but also stubborn.  Circe’s numerous pleas came to no avail and tragedies happened one after another.  Their daughter killed her brother, who had hoped to reason with her, in order to save the warrior.  If he had not been stubborn, their son and daughter would not have suffered like this, but the king remained obdurate all along.  In a single night, Circe lost her most precious children at the same time...

        “If the king does not show any sign of regret, I should let him taste my pain...I, Circe, no, the Queen, will take over...” murmured Circe, holding a small bottle of fluid in her hand and walking towards the king’s bedroom...</p>
