        <h1>Sterile Scuffle - Sean</h1>
        <p>
                Sean, whose soul had merged with the fire element, saw an alternative future in an illusion created by the runestones—

        “Molly! I’ll stall the Valkyrie! You guys go climb the tower!” shouted Sean, who raised his sword and charged at the Valkyrie bravely. Unexpectedly, his vision spun for a moment as if someone gave his soul a punch when he saw the Valkyrie’s face.

        “She… Why does she look so familiar… It’s just like she’s someone close—”

        “Sean!” Molly’s terrified scream brought Sean out of the trance. He abruptly lifted his head only to find that the Valkyrie’s scythe had come close to the tip of his nose, so he hurriedly raised his sword and summoned dragonfire to parry the strike.

        “I have to focus! Anyhow, the past has passed. Now the only thing I should do is to keep the pact with my companions and stop the wars on this continent with everything I have!”

        And so, Sean cleared his mind and focused on his enemy. Out of the state of confusion, he exerted an unexceptional strength and defeated the Valkyrie right before he was about to fall. Then, he made it to the Ocean of Gates with his companions.

        With help from Molly and Duncan, Sean convinced Endor and Nathaniel to contribute their power to secure the seal on the tower and stop the demons’ scheme.

        Having lost most of their strength, the five scattered: Duncan returned to the forest and became a teacher for the younger generations; Nathaniel continued to lead the army in combat; Endor embarked on a journey to appease the spirits of the deceased; Molly returned to the college with Sean, who was seriously wounded. Staying at the college dorm, he enjoyed a brief period of peace with Molly.

        However, Sean failed to resist the urge to return to the army after his body had recovered. Still, he stayed in touch with Molly by writing her letters every week and he looked forward to her writing back. At that moment, Sean was still full of hope and excitement for the future and the world.

        It was only until later when he was stationed in a chaotic war zone where the ground was strewn with corpses that he finally woke up from the beautiful fantasy in his head.

        With the bodies of his comrades sprawled across the moorland, the air was filled with the smell of blood and gunpowder. The wounded soldiers’ screams and groans of pain echoed in his ears. The battlefield was even more dreadful than the one where he and his companions made their pact.

        “In the end, the war still continues even after we lost so many things to seal the tower. So is our pact nothing but a joke… No! I will never admit that!”

        A roar of rage came through Sean’s clenched teeth. Yet, his roar could not change anything. War still came ruthlessly. He led a troop of soldiers into the battlefield but only he made it back alive.

        In one of the warring days, he survived the battlefield again. Yet, he barely had the strength to change his armor after his survival this time. He simply sat down before the campfire gloomily. Just when everyone thought that he had become a statue, he finally moved. He took out a crumpled, bloodstained yet unfinished letter from his armor and threw it into the fire silently.

        “Why did you burn it? It took you so long to write,” a comrade said with pity.

        “Because…” As Sean stared at the flickering flames, he recalled the time when Molly bandaged his wounds which were a product of his recklessness next to a similar campfire. Feeling nostalgia for the good old days, he let out a soft sigh and continued, “...that would only upset her.”

        “I can’t give her promises. The last thing I should do is to give her hope. I can’t ask her to tether her life to mine and wait for me with worry day after day just because she makes me happy. That’s just selfish.”

        Just like the promise they had made in the past.

        Sean’s lips curled up into a wry smile. It was something that had never appeared on his face. Disappointment after disappointment, his courage and conviction were dampened, and eventually, he stopped imagining the day when his dream would come true.

        At some point, Sean did not even know why he was still standing on the battlefield; he did not know what he was fighting for. Still, he could not give up as if he would lose direction once he stopped.

        “Perhaps death is my only way out of the battlefield,” Sean thought while writing another letter before the campfire.

        Sean’s premonition soon came true. He was tortured to death by the demons after he used himself as a diversion and lured the demon army away to protect the civilians during one of the enemies’ raids. Feeling humiliated, the demons tormented Sean and hung his body on a tree in revenge. It was also the reason why it did not take Sean’s comrades much time to find his body.

        Sean’s comrades sent out the bloodstained letter left on his body along with the letters of many other soldiers. When Molly received Sean’s letter, the circular burn marks and his final words filled her eyes with tears that could not wash away the blood stain on the letter.

        “I would never be lost in the memories that don’t belong to me because I have my own life as Sean the swordsman.”</p>
