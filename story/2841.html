        <h1>Conceptual Derivation - Daoloth</h1>
        <p>Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.6

        When Daoloth and Azathoth reunited in Tarones after their first encounter, without any interceptions, their souls resonated as overwhelming emotions that transcended their instincts bloomed inside them, urging them to understand and embrace each other.

        Unfortunately, their transcendent powers were not compatible. Symptoms of imminent collapse also appeared upon Azathoth as it succumbed to the distorting force within Daoloth.

        In a bid to protect Azathoth, Daoloth, having recovered from the brink of maddening collapse, did not chase after Azathoth, who had departed Tarones. Instead, it watched as Azathoth’s figure receded with blessings in its eyes, resolved to face its inevitable demise alone. Yet, Daoloth aspired to do one last thing before embracing death—to give Azathoth its final and grandest creation.

        Daoloth was then once again consumed by distortion upon completing another creation. As Daoloth lost its ability to sustain its physical form, its metallic body began to fracture incessantly with grotesque clusters of misshapen tissues sprouting from the fissures. A foul and viscous fluid flowed out of its lacerated flesh and spread across the cosmos.

        Upon witnessing such a gruesome spectacle, Ubbo, one of Daoloth’s followers, pleaded tearfully with its lord to cease its creation. However, driven by instinct, Daoloth adamantly refused its imploration.

        Daoloth’s unwavering determination spurred Ubbo to make up its mind. Joining forces with Azathoth, it succeeded in removing the instinct of creation that had continued to consume Daoloth. Yet, Daoloth was soon plunged into the depths of absolute chaos as it lost the mutational force that originated in higher dimensions which had parasitized its body, mind, and soul for a long time.

        Daoloth’s soul persisted in mending its devastated consciousness and reconstructing its disfigured body until it heard a resounding roar that shook the fabric of the universe.

        “...Azathoth… It’s the cry of Azathoth…” Even amid the maelstrom of utter confusion, Daoloth still recognized the love of its soul. “It’s in anger, in pain, in despair, in madness…”

        Daoloth could feel the pain Azathoth was suffering. Daoloth, still carrying the wounds upon its trembling soul, yearned to awaken from the void and embrace the tormented Azathoth.         However, it could only perceive the events unfolding within Azathoth while expediting the repairs to its incompletely recovered soul and body.

        Daoloth witnessed Azathoth ensnared by the thread of causality that shimmered with gold and silver. It also saw how Azathoth resolutely prevented the instinct of creation from delving back into its body by forcefully breaking the thread of causality and swallowing the instinct. Yet, in doing so, Azathoth sent itself into ruthless torture as the two high-dimensional forces clashed within it, coupled with the backlash of the thread of causality.

        Although Yibb had successfully destroyed the wellspring of powers—the deviation from the broken thread of causality—on Azathoth’s skin at the price of its life, the two high-dimensional powers persisted in fighting within Azathoth.

        The antagonism between two opposite high-dimensional forces tore apart Azathoth’s soul and chiseled away its consciousness. The endless self-reconstruction and cognitive negation urged it to profane all existence and hungrily gnaw at the fabric of space, creating countless holes that disrupted the orbit of reality.

        “Azathoth, wait for me. Soon…soon I shall awaken and come to save you,” Daoloth murmured anxiously, on the verge of completing the reassembly of its consciousness.

        However, the interloper made its move again. Wielding the shimmering remnants of the thread of causality, Mordiggian attempted to ensnare Azathoth again, to take over its powers, existence, and fate.

        Fortunately, Ghroth’s emergence thwarted Mordiggian’s malicious plan. Driven by its infatuation with Azathoth, Ghroth disregarded the dangers and voluntarily approached Azathoth, who had slipped into sheer madness, prepared to accept the death bestowed upon it.

        “No, the lord of dreams must not perish. I need its powers to save Azathoth.” The moment Daoloth, who fully comprehended the situation from the sidelines, completed the repairs to its consciousness, it woke up and slithered toward Azathoth, moving its tail to rescue Ghroth before Azathoth’s teeth ground it down.

        With their tail wrapped around Ghroth, Daoloth did not dare to stop for a second. It only came to a halt after and released Ghroth after it soared through light-years. But as soon as it loosened its grip, an intense murderous intent emanated from Ghroth, who stared at Daoloth with its colossal eyes while proclaiming through clenched teeth, “Azathoth, is mine! Boohoo… I’ll kill you… Haha!”

        Ghroth opened its bloodied maw, lunging to devour Daoloth.

        Prepared in advance, Daoloth swung a metallic ring to stop Ghroth while encircling it with a plasma-emitting metal orb, blocking its escape. Daoloth then spoke, “The lord of dreams, quiet yourself if you wish to save Azathoth.”

        Daoloth’s words momentarily subdued Ghroth’s murderous intent, but not its hostility. Ghroth scornfully glared at Daoloth, uttering, “I know…how to save Azathoth… just like you…boohoo…sever…that detestable instinct… I... I can do it… Haha!”

        “It’s impossible. There are two high-dimensional forces within Azathoth. Their powers are beyond our reach.”

        “What do we do? What do we do? How can we save Azathoth? No, no, Azathoth can’t disappear… Ah… Ahhhhhhh—!” Ghroth screamed, deeply disturbed by the prospect of Azathoth’s impending demise, its eyes swirling with madness.

        “Then we’ll resolve it in the future,” Daoloth replied resolutely. “Although we can’t find a way to save Azathoth now, our future selves will undoubtedly accomplish it. To that end, we must seal Azathoth along with the high-dimensional forces within it.”

        “Yes, yes, yes! We have to, we have to save Azathoth!”

        “Then heed my instructions, the lord of dreams.”

❉　　

        While the immense shadow continued to devour the orderly cosmos, Azathoth’s soft tentacles expanded its dominion with countless pairs of grotesque wings flapping within the darkness. Beneath the wings were spikes and mouths with serrated fangs that spewed abhorrent and maddening curses.

        Suddenly, the curses ceased. All the tentacle wings pointed in the same direction, toward the colossal shadow—Azathoth, who could no longer maintain its sense of self under the clash of two high-dimensional forces. With its stable form distorted into an indescribable visage, it became an existence that was driven solely by instinct.

        Sensing the presence of a living being nearby, Azathoth surged with murderous intent, ready to obliterate upon detection. However, an indescribable melody reached their ears first instead.

        It was an extraordinarily gentle singing voice that was yet capable of resonating throughout the entire universe and reaching every living creature’s ears. The music, on the other hand, carried the immense power of the stars with indescribable beauty and otherworldly enchantment. It harmonized with the fragmented and shattered cosmos, resonating with the most fervent voice of life, purifying the dreadful source permeating the universe, and suppressing the two opposing high-dimensional forces that were driving Azathoth towards uncontrollable madness.

        “Whose…singing voice is it… So familiar… I must find it…” The familiar voice restored a fragment of Azathoth’s sanity and pulled it back from the abyss of endless chaos, allowing it to engage in limited contemplation. It grew desperate, longing to discover the source of the singing. However, its blurred consciousness could only vaguely evoke a profound and significant feeling, but the cause of the feeling eluded its recollection.

        Moving its “body”, Azathoth traversed the universe, leaving deep marks in its wake. Finally, it found the source—a radiant being hovering above a world known as Tarones with its golden light shrouding the very land of destiny.

        The golden creature consisted of countless shimmering crystalline minerals and metallic blocks. Its skin was covered with scales and pulsating muscles. Beneath its torso were several robust tentacles, each holding a different instrument in their nimble grasp, producing the most marvelous melodies.

        The sight of the golden entity illuminated Azathoth’s cloudy consciousness in an instant., clearing its chaotic mind. With boundless longing, it called out to the presence that had long taken residence within its soul.

        “Dao… Daoloth…”

        “You came. I knew you would come to find me,” Daoloth said, ceasing its performance. Its golden eyes held a tender gaze as it looked upon the indescribably horrifying visage of Azathoth.

        In search of a means to suppress the high-dimensional forces, Daoloth, accompanied by Ghroth, traversed the cosmos. They retrieved the spear fashioned by Azathoth with the power of constellations to destroy the instinct of creation within Daoloth’s body.

        Daoloth infused its own powers into the spear, transforming it into an array of unimaginable instruments which dispersed its powers to Azathoth so as to ease its maddening symptoms.

        However, Azathoth understood better than anyone that its newfound clarity was only momentary. The presence of the two opposing high-dimensional forces within its body could not be easily expelled. It would inevitably sink into madness again, and it would not hesitate to harm Daoloth or any life form that stood before it. So, it suppressed the desires within and snarled ferociously, “Damned Daoloth! Stay away from me! Be Gone for good!”

        “No, I won’t leave you.” Daoloth gently swayed their form, refusing to yield. With a hint of obsession, it proclaimed, “Azathoth, the other half of my soul, saving you is my instinct, an eternal urge that can never be severed from my soul.”

        “But it will cost you your life, and destroy your soul!”

        “Even so, I willingly bring miracles for you, just as you have done for me.”

        “And then we will both fall to the accursed fate! I can’t take it! Daoloth! Run from me!”

        Azathoth intended to launch an attack to drive Daoloth away, but Daoloth preempted it. It moved forward and embraced Azathoth, halting its empty threats and bluffing gestures.

        Daoloth’s metallic essence permeated Azathoth’s will, enveloping it in a unique coldness. Pliable and vulnerable, Azathoth was torn between pushing Daoloth away and holding it close. Its hesitation robbed it of any chance to break free.

        “Azathoth, no. We won’t succumb to fate. Please, trust me. I will guide you and lead you into a better future.”

        “...Damn you, Daoloth! You know I can never resist you!”

        Daoloth swayed its tentacles, and an array of instruments resonated with crystalline tones as if chuckling on Daoloth’s behalf.

        “Here, slumber within my consciousness. Forget all suffering and torment. I will give anything to save you, to free you from this agonizing cycle.”

        As Daoloth mustered the power within, its form expanded in both directions. Its metallic and crystalline body became the size of Azathoth in an instant. The two entwined with one another, their souls merging through their physicality, exuding the most primal and purest form of love.

        The two transcendent beings descended into the gentle ocean of love, dancing together amid the shattered cosmos, performing a resplendent and intricate dance of souls.

        In that fleeting moment, both Daoloth and Azathoth yearned for the dance to continue; they longed to dance on the edge of the world and twirl until the end of the universe so that they could forever remain intertwined and inseparable. Unfortunately, not all wishes come true in reality, be it from insignificant creatures or transcendent beings.

        Thus, fate remains impartial and unfair in equal measure because it never wavers; it neither mourns one’s misfortune nor rejoices in one’s happiness.

        Eventually, the song came to an end and so did the dance.

        “Daoloth, this is a gift I want to give you before my eternal slumber. May it shield you from all misfortune, from the past to the future, until the end of the cosmos, where our souls shall be extinguished.”

        By absorbing the power of constellations Daoloth had offered, Azathoth successfully suppressed the two writhing high-dimensional forces. Just before its consciousness faded away, Azathoth extracted the remnants of its transcendent power and infused it into Daoloths body.

        “Azathoth, sleep now. Let yourself sink into the blissful realm of dreams, and forget the tormenting instincts. I shall redeem you when you awaken,” Daoloth murmured while catching the slumbering Azathoth. Scorching tears cascaded from its golden eyes like a breathtaking meteor shower.

        “Ghroth, come forth,” Daoloth shouted into the void. Ghroth promptly arrived, its immense gaze fixated upon Azathoth cradled in Daoloth’s embrace. Its eyes reflected a frenzied obsession and fervor.

        “Seal Azathoth and the instincts within the realm of dreams.”

        “Haha… Azathoth, it’s just you and me… Woo… I will be watching over you forever.” Ghroth trembled with excitement. Its pupils spun madly for its long-held desires were finally about to be fulfilled. However, sealing a formidable existence like Azathoth exacted a tremendous cost upon Ghroth. Only by exhausting its entire soul and allowing its consciousness to merge wholly with the realm of dreams would Ghroth be able to possess sufficient power to seal such transcendent forces.

        Yet, to Ghroth, it was a price it was willing to pay; it would give anything as long as it could live with Azathoth. Therefore, it joyfully abandoned its corporeal form and allowed its soul to dive into Azathoth, channeling its powers to induce Azathoth along with the two high-dimensional forces into a slumber. Then, it vanished completely from reality, returning to the realm of dreams to watch over its beloved Azathoth.

        In the blink of an eye, the boundless cosmos was left with only Daoloth, who remained awake. The separation from Azathoth had left an indelible wound upon its soul. But Daoloth had no time for sorrow because there were countless tasks it had to do before rescuing Azathoth.

        “Azathoth, please wait for me. I shall once again perform an unparalleled miracle for you.” Daoloth tightly embraced Azathoth, who had transformed back into its dragon form. Within its eyes shimmered a love and determination so profound that it could never be replicated. The metallic dragon tail swayed as Daoloth set forth towards the fated land named Tarones...</p>
