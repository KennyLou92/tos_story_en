        <h1>Gyre of Resonance - Novalis & Ursula</h1>
        <p>Ursula and Novalis were two victims of a horrible experiment conducted by some deranged wizards who turned them into vessels of the ethereal dragons’ powers in the ancient era. While Ursula became the Dragon Maiden who could understand the Dracospirits’ whispers, Novalis was chosen by Faugn the ethereal dragon and became a Dragon Follower.

Kind-hearted yet clumsy, Ursula yearned to communicate with the ethereal dragons. She believed that the dragons’ arrival was meant to liberate humanity rather than bring about its destruction.

Novalis, on the other hand, harbored a deep hatred for all things related to the ethereal dragons. Driven by a thirst for greater power, he embarked on a journey and met Ursula in an accident along the way. The two then became companions in their undesignated adventure.</p>
