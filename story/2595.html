        <h1>Divinity of War - Chiyou</h1>
        <p>        In the Heavenly Kingdom, two men were sitting on the summit surrounded by clouds. A white-haired, burly man Chiyou pulled a long face as he played chess with Huangdi Huangdi. “I...lose.” Chiyou was so reluctant to accept this result.

        “Then?” Huangdi asked calmly as he spread his paper fan.

        “I’m a man of my word. Xiao Feng...is yours, temporarily.” With a whistle, Chiyou summoned a firebird to come.

        “Ha, this is truly breathtaking. I'll take good care of it——”

        “This is just temporary! I’ll win it back next time!” Chiyou jumped off the peak after the conversation; thoughts kept flashing in his mind.

        “First, I need to improve my chess skills...Only she could help me!” Changing direction, Chiyou rushed to the eastern side through the sky, arriving at an exquisite residence by the lake. The aroma of lotus filled the air even from a distance.

        “Here it is, the residence of He Xian’gu,” Chiyou thought to himself. When he was about to step forward, the door was opened, revealing a graceful figure.

        “Lady He Xian’gu, please wait!” Chiyou tried to stop her, but He Xian’gu was in a bad mood today, glaring at him with a frown.

        “You’re...Chiyou, one of the Divine Xians…” Her brows tightened even more.

        Although she had never talked with Chiyou, He Xian’gu still heard of his history from the Xians, who was nicknamed “Heartstring Tugger” among the females. It was known that Chiyou’s actions often misled other female Xians unintentionally, so He Xian’gu did not have a liking for him.

        Nevertheless, Chiyou was totally unaware of his mistaken impression. “Yes! I’d like to invite you——”, he requested with a carefree smile.

        “Sorry I’m busy, so please excuse me.” He Xian’gu cut in without any hesitation and walked away.

        However, something miraculous happened. A gust of strong wind caught He Xian’gu off guard and blew her down——

        She fell into someone’s warm embrace, with her gaze fixing on a handsome face from such a close distance. “He’er, did you get hurt?” Chiyou asked worriedly.

        “What did you just call me?!” The call sent ripples into He Xian’gu’s heart, but she managed to maintain her composure.

        “It’s rumored that the lotus will look particularly beautiful when you’re next to them. The fragrance of you and the aroma of the lotus are a perfect match, which makes me call you even without realizing it.” Chiyou meant what he said.

        He Xian’gu was not only put on such a cute nickname by Chiyou, but she was also described with her body scent explicitly, which had completely flushed her face. He Xian’gu made a cough to calm herself down and changed a topic. “What can I do for you?”

        Chiyou was reminded of his original purpose of the visit. “I heard that you’re an exceptional chess player. Can you teach me?”

        “I owed him a favor. Wouldn’t it be cold if I turn him down…” Then, He Xian’gu had a good idea.

        “My chess skills are not sophisticated enough to be your teacher, but I don’t mind sharing some experience with you. But in return you need to do me a favor.”

        “Fair enough.” Chiyou patted his chest with confidence. “Consider it done.”

        Therefore, Chiyou followed He Xian’gu to descend to the realm, heading east to the bottom of the sea——the underwater world full of corals and algae.

        “Your mission is to collect this pink seaweed. Remember, it has to be pink.” He Xian’gu handed it over to Chiyou.

        “The pink seaweed...but what for?” He asked in puzzlement.

        “Ah...It’s important for my own purposes. Stop talking and go find it.” He Xian’gu was guilty of speaking too much, but the straightforward Chiyou did not pay attention, and followed her order to collect the seaweed.

        At dusk, Chiyou brought loads of seaweed back to He Xian’gu. When he was about to return, a shout was heard.

        “What do you mean by this?”

        “It’s He’er. She seems to be in trouble. Gotta help her!” Following the voice, Chiyou found He Xian’gu quickly, who was confronting a troop of prawns and crabs.

        “He’er!” Chiyou rushed to her in no time; his solid voice somehow made her heart pump fast.

        “Tut! Another god, how annoying!” The prawn general said with disdain.

        “This is our turd. Just because Master Ao Guang isn’t here, it doesn’t mean you can trespass on our land! Leave or die!” The crab general raised its pincer to intimidate.

        “Ha, funny! Then show me what you’ve got!” The charming smile of He Xian’gu had caught the attention of the generals. Before long, shame and anger made them flush all over when they stayed focused.

        “Ignorant fool! Let us show you the power of our clan! Everyone, march!” Under the general’s command, troops of sea monsters swarmed to surround He Xian’gu and Chiyou.

        “Humph! Weaklings are weaklings. Let me—— Chiyou?” When He Xian’gu was gathering power, he covered her hand with his palm.

        “I’ll be sad if you get hurt, so let me handle this.” Chiyou fixed his gaze at He Xian’gu, who was touched by his low yet gentle voice. Her heart was beating fast like a girl falling in love——

        “Hold your horses and wake up, He Xian’gu! This guy doesn’t mean what he says! Don’t forget other Xians’ comments about him.”

        “Cough, well I’ll leave them to you then.” She pretended to be calm.

        “Stop the show! We’ll send both of you to heaven,” said the prawn general.

        “Right, we have the advantage in water. You can’t beat us!” The crab general continued.

        “Ha, indeed. I’m not good at fighting underwater.” Chiyou took out a piece of flint and swallowed. Soon he was coiled up by flames. A crimson eye was revealed in his chest, exuding with an intimidating aura.

        “In this case, I’ll just evaporate all water.” Chiyou, buffed by the berserk power, was releasing an overwhelming Xian energy, which was turned into fire, overspreading the entire area. In the blink of an eye, the water nearby was evaporated; those sea monsters were therefore immobilized due to a lack of water.

        Chiyou summoned a bone sword, approaching the generals step by step——

        “Hold!” An azure figure stood in front of the army. “I, Ao Guang, Dragon King of the Sea, apologize for my troops’ recklessness.”

        “Humph! You’re the one who started with this fight! Do you think you can settle it just by an apology——” Chiyou stopped talking as He Xian’gu patted his shoulder.

        “For the sake of Tianzun, we’re even now,” He Xian’gu said in a low voice. 

        “Thank you.” Ao Guang signalled a soldier with a gaze to hand a basket to He Xian’gu, which contained the pink seaweed she was looking for.

        “I know you’re looking for skincare ingredients. Consider this as our gratitude.”

        “Skincare?” Chiyou murmured and looked at her. “So you’re using this for making skin products?”

        Embarrassed, He Xian’gu had no choice but to admit. “Recently I’ve been busy dealing with the Holy Gods overnight. Yesterday Lü Dongbin even said I looked old, so I was counting on the pink seaweed for skincare. What? Isn’t it normal——Em!” 

        Chiyou raised her chin with his right hand to take a closer look at her face. Unable to break loose, He Xian’gu could not help but looked him in the eyes. Then he wore a smile suddenly as if he found an exciting thing. “You’re as perfect as lotus in nature. Those skincare products are completely unnecessary.”

        “You——!” Chiyou’s words touched He Xian’gu’s heart. Blushing, she turned around and summoned a lotus in order to cover up the embarrassment. “Let’s, let’s go back!”

        “Okay!” The upright Chiyou was unaware of the trouble he made and followed her back to the Heavenly Kingdom buoyantly.

        Under the guidance of He Xian’gu, Chiyou successfully won the chess match against Huangdi afterwards, getting his Xiao Feng back. However, things were not over yet...</p>
