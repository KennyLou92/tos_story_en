        <h1>Dio Brando</h1>
        <p>He was adopted by the Joestar family after his fatherâ€™s death. 
He is cold-hearted, calculating, and ambitious. While appearing as a virtuous young man on the surface, he secretly plans to take over the Joestar family. 
As part of his scheme to make it seem like Jonathan died in an accident, he sets his sights on the Stone Mask.</p>
