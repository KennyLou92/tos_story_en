        <h1>Sapphire</h1>
        <p>Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 11

        Inside an isolated country, there nurtured a special sort of elves. The species was called minerelf, for their body structure consisted of jewels. The nation gradually thrived under the king’s rule, and this story began at the thriving age…

When most of the students were chatting in the garden during lunch break, a girl Sapphire was observing from a corner.

“Why are there so many elves today...I guess I have no choice but to use my power.”

Crystallizing her legs, Sapphire swept through the route she calculated to avoid everyone. Her speed was so fast that it caused a strong breeze, blowing their dresses up.

Despite a mini chaos caused, Sapphire ignored it and kept moving at high speed. She stopped at a grand house——the library of Minerelf  Girls’ School. As she pushed the door open, bookshelves packed with books came into her sight, forming an impressive picture.

“Great. I made it today,” Sapphire smiled as she thought. Looking around, she saw no elves in this tranquil library.

The atmosphere here always left Sapphire in peace, but she needed more security. Next, she climbed up a wooden ladder to the top of a bookshelf, where there was a narrow space that fitted one elf only. This was the secret base of Sapphire, who came here every time during recess to enjoy her private time.

“Huh? Why is the ladder here? It must be the students forgetting to put it back,” a teacher mumbled, who put the ladder back to original position and left.

Sapphire, carried away by reading, didn’t notice this change; by the time she did, it was already too late.

“What? The ladder is gone? How am I supposed to go down?” Sapphire pondered for solution anxiously as she stared at the ground.

Foom! The library door was barged open, followed by the appearance of a dazzling “girl”. The way that “girl” sat on a chair was not gentle and graceful like a girl should be, but more like a boy.

The truth was that this breath-takingly gorgeous “girl” here was a boy indeed. For some reasons, he had to disguise as a girl and study at this school. As for Sapphire, of course she wouldn’t know his secret. All she needed was drawing his attention to help herself down.

“Wheeze...This is exhausting. I can’t spread my legs or talk loud——” The fatigue Diamond collapsed onto the chair whining, and a sudden dropping sound cut in.

“What’s that?” A chill ran down his spine; Diamond sat straight and looked around. Very soon, he spotted something dropped on the floor nearby. Taking a closer look, it was revealed to be a lady shoe. 

“Why is there a shoe? Who does it belong to?” 

“It’s mine.”

“AHHHH!” Diamond screamed and turned around, meeting the gaze of Sapphire on the top of the bookshelf.

“A-A-A-Are you t-t-the ghost in the library as the rumor told?” Diamond stuttered in panic.

“Open your eyes, you idiot. Do I look like a ghost?” The salty Sapphire cleared his puzzle.

“Umm...Then why are you up there?”

“Just use your brain, can’t you? Of course I’m avoiding the other elves.”

“...Then someone moved away the ladder, and that’s how you’re stuck up there. You threw your shoe to draw my attention and call for help. Am I right?

“Stop talking and help me if you know what happened.” The attitude Sapphire had didn’t sound like begging for help at all.

As for Diamond, he didn’t take her words personal because he was “well-trained” by his sisters in all these years with tolerance. A moment later, Sapphire finally returned to the ground with Diamond’s help.

Because of throwing away a shoe earlier, Sapphire attempted to bend down and pick up her shoe while standing on one leg. Yet it was too difficult, almost tripping herself. Diamond, unable to sit back, decided to help her again. Picking up the shoe, Diamond knelt down on one knee.

“Ugh. It’s gonna take you forever to put on the shoe. Let me help.”

“Alright.”

Sapphire suddenly felt too shy to talk; Looking away, she put her feet onto Diamond’s knee. Meanwhile, Diamond lift her feet up with his gloved hands, putting the shoe on carefully. The way he handled was so gentle, as if handling something fragile.

There was a kind of unspoken, flirty atmosphere lingering between them, which made Diamond momentarily forget his phobia about female. At this moment, his full concentration was on the shoe.

“Alright,” said Diamond, breaking the awkward silence.

“...Thanks.” Sapphire tidied his collar awkwardly.

The book on Sapphire’s hand caught Diamond’s eyes, surprising him.

“Wait! Is this the part 2 of “Sotta’s Adventure Time”?”

“You know this book too?”

“Yes! I want to read the part 2 so bad, but I couldn’t find it. And you did it among this sea of books! Amazing!”

As Sapphire saw the excitement on Diamond’s face, she hesitated for a moment before giving the book to him.

“...Take it.”

“Huh? Aren’t you reading it?”

“You helped me. I’ll let you read first to return the favour.” 

“Thanks so much!” While Diamond took the book excitedly, he patted his chest and said, “don’t worry. I’ll return what I borrowed from my friend!”

“Friend?” Sapphire repeated. A hint of joy could be seen on her expression. “Are you talking about me?”

“Of course. Otherwise, what else can you be, the ghost in the library?” Diamond smiled brightly.

“We’re friends sharing the same hobby!”

Soon, the two elves waved goodbye. Looking at the departing Diamond, Sapphire felt heart-warming while smiling.

“We’re friends…”</p>
