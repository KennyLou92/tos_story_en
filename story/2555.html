        <h1>Lü Lingshuang the Horrid Chariot</h1>
        <p>
                In the White Queen’s castle in Wonderland, a figure bounded through the gate, racing directly to the center of the castle. Sitting on the throne, the White Queen was waiting with her chin resting on one hand. Then a dormouse, which disembarked from its mount, knelt before her and reported, ‘Your Majesty, I saw it with my own eyes. I swear it’s true! The Queen of Hearts’ belly was bulging. She must be pregnant! She will be defenseless if we attack her now!’

        As the White Queen waved her hand, her pawns immediately stood in formation; the dormouse also got back to its mount for the coming war. The army’s march caught the eye of a pneuma with blue light, which slowly turned into a grinning child and ran towards the Castle of Hearts…

        In the castle, Lü Bu quietly pushed open the door only to find the Queen of Hearts sleeping on her chair in exhaustion. As Lü Bu  patted her head gently, the Queen of Hearts opened her eyes and gave him a smile. Just as she was about to stand up, Lü Bu motioned her to sit down. He then squatted down and put his ears on her bulging belly, listening attentively to the heartbeats inside. Following her breath, her belly rose and fell; even the clothes couldn’t conceal the warmth beneath it…

        A new life is coming to this world…

        ‘Ba!’ Lü Lingshuang popped up before the window! The Queen of Hearts felt a nagging anxiety whenever she saw him for it meant that Lü Bu’s murderous desire would be ignited again. Lü Bu did spend more time in Wonderland than before ever since he had learnt that she was pregnant. However, every time this kid appeared, Lü Bu would surely go out to wage war… Yet, this time was different.

        With the pawns’ marching sound slowly approached, the White Queen’s sneak attack infuriated Lü Bu to another level. From his eyes, the Queen of Hearts could tell that he was more conscientious in protecting her and the child to be born instead of pursuing slaughter as usual. As Lü Bu looked back, she felt a sense of relief. However,  a throbbing pain came to her belly shortly after he left…

        By the time the White Queen arrived, Lü Bu was already waiting by the gate with a smile, letting a kid bathed in blue light swing his halberd! The White Queen was caught off guard; meanwhile countless pawns had been knocked down by the child…

        When Lü Bu repelled the White Queen, the castle had already slid into chaos, in which everyone was walking around hurriedly. The March Hare rushed to him and asked him to return to the Queen of Hearts as soon as he could. The moment he stepped into the room, he saw a bunch of servants surrounding the Queen of Hearts, who was screaming hysterically. When Lü Bu came to her side, she barely had the strength to looked at him. Yet her slender fingers clenched his hand tightly as she screamed.

        Lü Bu was also thrown into panic, which was a feeling that he never had before on the battlefield. At that moment, the feelings of anxiety, distress, and excitement intertwined in his heart…

        As a loud cry resounded through the room, finally, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. While the Queen of Hearts held that fragile life in her arms,  Lü Bu gave her a kiss on the forehead gently, supporting her weak body. That unbelievably light and fragile being preoccupied Lü Bu…Since then, the Queen of Heart hadn’t seen Lü Lingshuang for a while.

        Yet, she had known long ago that the peaceful days would come to an end someday. When Lü Bu found that her daughter’s blood could turn into fire during their combat lesson, he was thrilled by such a unique talent. Watching the interaction between the father and daughter, the Queen of Hearts felt a faint chill—that ball of blue light was back and gradually turning into a child, the being that caused her anxiety.

        Afterward, Lü Bu went out for wars time after time; the murderous desire that had ceased in his body for a long time was once again rekindled. Thinking of that, the Queen of Hearts couldn’t stop feeling worried. One day, she held her young daughter in silence while holding a searing poker card in her hand. As young and innocent as the daughter was, she could still tell her mother’s anxiety from her slight tremor.

        By then, Lü Bu had just returned. Unexpectedly, his undue murderous desire that had not receded turned against them with the halberd. The Queen of Hearts immediately dodged Lü Lingshuang’s attack with her daughter in her arms until he eventually  dispersed from Lü Bu’s body. It was only until Lü Bu, who had come back to his senses, saw the perturbed expression on her face that he realized he was at the risk of losing control… 

        Under the soothing music, the Queen of Hearts sat by the bed and looked at her daughter’s sleeping face quietly. Standing behind her, Lü Bu put a necklace on her. Surprised by the coldness on her chest, she looked down and found that it was a locket with their daughter’s portrait inside. The Queen of Hearts then lifted her head and looked at him only to hear Lü Bu saying with an unusual expression,

        ‘For the sake of our daughter, I promise you that I will never die on the battlefield. If I go out of control one day, please come and wake me.’

        ‘I hope that day will never come.’ Holding Lü Bu’s hand back, the Queen of Hearts quietly watched the lingering blue light evanesce…</p>
