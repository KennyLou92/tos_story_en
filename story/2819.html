        <h1>A Tug at Heartstrings - Kejourou</h1>
        <p>        It was a night with a bright moon shining high in the sky. The gentle moonlight streamed into the room of Kejourou, who was the most famous geisha in the brothel. Impeccably dressed, Kejourou walked to the window and looked at the full moon in the sky. Then she turned her gaze on the row of lifelike wooden sculptures on the window sill. Her heart lightened up with excitement.

        “Today is the day. I can finally meet him again. I wonder what he will tell me today.”

        On every night of the full moon, a man would come to see Kejourou and listen to her singing behind the blind. On each of his regular visits, he would bring her a small wooden sculpture. Although the sculptures were no valuables, the man would share his stories and the things he had seen with Kejourou through them, giving her a chance to take a peek at the world outside the brothel.

        The man treated Kejourou like a friend. All he did was mostly chitchat in which he shared the trivial matters in his life with her. Unlike the stiff and nervous conversation with other customers, the meeting with the man had always been a pleasure to Kejourou. That was why she felt most relaxed and looked forward to meeting him the most.

        As usual, Kejourou went to the room and sat on the other side of the blind. Soon, the wooden door was pushed open—her customer had arrived.

        With a blind that hung from the ceiling to the ground between the two, they could only see a rough figure of each other. After the customer sat down, Kejourou pulled up a corner of the blind to serve the tea she had prepared. Then she began to play music and sing.

        There was only the sound of the shamisen and Kejourou’s singing voice in the room. Even though none of them spoke a word, Kejourou could still feel the silent communication between her and the man.

        However, Kejourou was not at her best that day. She found that her throat began to dry after singing just two songs.

        “I must have sung too much this week but he loves hearing me sing. I can’t disappoint him”

        So Kejourou put up with the sore throat and continued to sing. She sounded the same as usual except her voice cracked slightly when she hit a few notes. One could barely spot the difference unless they listened to her singing meticulously. Unexpectedly, a cup of hot beverage with rising steam was pushed toward Kejourou through a lifted corner of the blind as she finished another song.

        ‘This is… for me?’

        ‘Your voice is slightly hoarse so I ordered a cup of pear juice with honey for you. It should help with your sore throat.’

        At first, Kejourou was surprised. Then an indescribable feeling welled up inside her with a burning sensation. Softly, she said, ‘Thank you…’

        Holding up the cup gingerly, she sipped the warm pear juice that hydrated her dry throat in an instant.

        ‘And this,’ said the customer while sliding a wooden sculpture of a cherry blossom through the blind.

        ‘I saw the cherry blossoms on the mountain a few days ago and they were very beautiful, and I want to show you their beauty.’

        Kejourou took a closer look at the sculpture and made a complimentary remark without a second thought, ‘It’s really pretty. I bet the flowers must look even more beautiful when you see them in person… It’s such a shame that I couldn’t see them with my own eyes…’

        ‘I can take you there. I can take you to see all the beautiful things around the world… I can take you out of here, as long as you want.’

        Kejourou was stunned. Her heart skipped a beat. It was only after a few seconds that her blood began to circulate again and flow toward her pounding heart.

        It was not the first time that Kejourou was offered to be freed from the brothel by her customers. Yet, all of them only wanted to take her as their concubine or ask her to stay at their home and serve them forever. The man in front of her was different—he offered to fulfill her wishes instead of his own.

        “He will never despise me… He will give me the freedom that I’ve always wanted… I… I believe him.”

        ‘I——’ Just when Kejourou was going to say yes, a creak of the door stopped her. Then she heard some hurried footsteps and whispers on the other side of the blind.

        The man abruptly stood up and said to her, ‘I have to go but I will be back. I hope you can give me an answer by then.’

        Leaving those words, the man left in a hurry. When Kejourou pulled up the blind, her customer had already gone.

        Kejourou was a little disappointed but she was not upset because she had hopes that the man would come back again.

        Unfortunately, the irony of fate did not spare Kejourou—her purity was forcibly taken by a customer. Depression rendered her heart into dust, and yet fate left her a string of hope. When Kejourou was ready to meet her end, the man—Shuten-dōji—came and saved her, beginning a relationship that would turn her world upside down…</p>
