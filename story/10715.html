        <h1>Atrocious Lineage - Gomorrah</h1>
        <p>
        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 9

        In a lush forest, a five-tailed cub galloped freely through the woods, passing tree after tree. She occasionally paused to pounce on the birds perched on the branches and relish the juicy fruits she plucked from the trees. It was not until sunset, when the earth basked in an orange hue, that the cub stopped her spontaneous exploration and rested by a lake. Her five majestic tails swayed from side to side, a clear indication of her relaxed mood. 

        However, her moments of peace in solitude were soon ruined when a four-tailed cub came.

        “Gomorrah, you skipped your practice session again,” the four-tailed cub, Admah, scoffed, casting a disdainful glance at Gomorrah.

        “Practicing is so boring! I’m not going back!” Gomorrah retorted.

        “And that’s why you still have five tails. Don’t you feel ashamed as the chieftain’s daughter?” Admah taunted.

        Admah and Gomorrah were both phantocaudas. Phantocaudas are beasts distinguished by their unique tails. When a phantocauda comes into the world, they boast five tails, each a testament to their nascent power. Yet, as the phantocauda grows in strength, their tails gradually merge and meld. Those with a solitary tail are regarded as the strongest, which is why the phantocaudas, who place an immense value on power over anything else, would train relentlessly, grasping every chance to become stronger.

        However, Gomorrah was different. She yearned to explore the colorful world and savor all the wonders it held rather than blindly pursuing power.

        “Humph! It’s none of your business! Yeah, I have five tails, and so what? My father is the chieftain, and he will protect me!”  Gomorrah exclaimed defiantly.

        “Hahaha, you’re so naive. We are phantocaudas who live in a place where only the strong make the rules. You can’t change that even if you’re the chieftain’s daughter,” Admah shrugged as he continued, “But that’s fine with me because your incompetence will only make it easier for me to take your place.”

        “That’s nonsense! You can’t replace me!” Gomorrah retorted sharply. However, Admah had already turned around and left with confidence, leaving her seething with indignation.

        ‘Admah that bastard. Even if I’m weak, there’s no way Father would ever abandon me!’ Gomorrah fumed. Her anger continued to mount until it erupted, followed by a thought coming into her mind, ‘I’m mad! I must tell Father what he said!’

        Gomorrah then rushed back to the enormous cavern that served as the phantocaudas’ abode. She sprinted toward her father’s chamber but halted at the entrance upon hearing voices emanating from inside.

        Driven by curiosity, she stealthily looked inside the chamber where she saw two mighty beasts in a meeting. One with a single tail sitting on an elevated platform was Zeboiim, Gomorrah’s father, while the other was her martial arts instructor, standing below and respectfully reporting to the chieftain.

        Rebellious as Gomorrah was, she did not dare to interrupt, so she remained outside the chamber, waiting. Just as she was about to fall asleep, she woke up with a jolt upon hearing her name.

        “Chief Zeboiim, the Trial of Valor is approaching, but Gomorrah’s tails still haven’t merged. It will be difficult for her to win. Should I make some preparations?” the instructor cautiously inquired.

        “That won’t be necessary,” Zeboiim responded firmly, his voice as calm as if he was discussing some mundane matters, “If she fails the trial, I’ll send her to the mining pits.”

        The mining pits were the lowest refuge of the phantocaudas, mostly inhabited by the elderly, infirm, and defeated warriors. With the harsh living conditions, the mining pits were considered a place for those deemed failures.

        “But she is your daughter, Wouldn’t it be too cruel…” the instructor questioned, his voice tinged with concern.

        “We phantocaudas honor power; and only with great power can one be deemed strong. My daughter has to be strong and exceptional, and if Gomorrah fails to do so, she simply isn’t worth my love and attention,” Zeboiim remarked.

        Gomorrah could not register the rest of the conversation as it faded into insignificance. The only thing she could feel was a numbing chill coursing through her entire body which dulled all her senses, leaving an aching void within her heart.


        ‘So Admah was right. If I’m not strong enough, Father won’t love me, and people won’t recognize me or respect me… Power is the key to getting everything.’ It was then that the cruel reality dawned on Gomorrah and instilled in her the fear of losing everything.

        From that day forward, Gomorrah shed her slothful demeanor and immersed herself in rigorous training, pushing herself harder than any of her fellow phantocaudas, including Admah.

        With her earnest endeavor, she managed to harness her extraordinary talent and combine her five tails into three in a short amount of time. Contrary to all expectations, she entered the Trial of Valor and emerged victorious. She won the wreath of laurels but at the cost of bearing numerous wounds and scars.

        When Gomorrah wearily descended from the winner’s podium, drenched in blood and sweat, Zeboiim, who had been waiting below, gave her a warm squeeze with a wide and radiant grin.

        “I am proud of you, my dear daughter,” he said.

        Zeboiim’s approval and embrace warmed Gomorrah’s heart and momentarily dispelled her fear. She opened her arms and hugged her father back, burying her head against his shoulder, seeking his love as always. 

        ‘Love only comes with conditions, but as long as I remain strong, I will never lose it,’ she thought.

        However, her belief was soon shattered after she met Mistilteinn, the gladiospina, from whom she witnessed a mother’s unconditional love.

        To protect her unborn child, Mistilteinn willingly surrendered herself to her enemy. She let them pin her wings to the wall of the dungeon, endured their degrading insults, and persevered through their brutal torture as a disgraced prisoner.

        Her actions made Gomorrah question: how could she go to such lengths for an unborn child, one that had yet shown its potential and worth? She grew intensely curious about the dragon, and after Zeboiim told her Mistilteinn’s child would become her sword, the possessive desire compelled her to visit Mistilteinn in the dungeon frequently.

        Despite Gomorrah’s identity as the malicious chieftain’s daughter, Mistilteinn did not take out her anger on the young phantocauda. Instead, she passionately shared every detail about the child growing within her womb, and Gomorrah also became excited to meet her future sword. Full of anticipation, she hurriedly visited Mistilteinn with her barely treated wounds from a grueling duel where she narrowly escaped death.

        “What happened?” Mistilteinn could not help but ask upon seeing Gomorrah’s grave wounds.

        “I was in a duel. I had to win or I would let my father down, and he wouldn’t love me anymore,” Gomorrah responded unemotionally, but her answer only elicited a sorrowful gaze from Mistilteinn.

        “It’s not supposed to be like that, my child,” Mistilteinn gently stroked Gomorrah’s head with her claws, “Love shouldn’t come with conditions, just as being powerful doesn’t mean you have to kill others.”

        “But everyone says we must be strong, stronger than anyone else…”

        “That’s because the harsh environment in the past left your ancestors no choice but to fight. But the world is constantly changing. Time progresses, and everyone strives to make the world a better place. So we mustn’t perceive the present and the future with outdated beliefs,” Mistilteinn gently said.

        “I don’t understand…” Gomorrah pouted in frustration.

        “It’s okay, Gomorrah. Just remember my words, and someday you will know.”

        It was not until Gomorrah witnessed Mistilteinn’s daughter, Sodom’s awakening, that she finally understood the meaning behind Mistilteinn’s words about unconditional love.

        Gomorrah’s heart began to pound heavily as Sodom’s bright and clear gaze fell upon her. A tingling sensation ran down her spine, sparking an overwhelming desire to protect this young gladiospina, even if it meant sacrificing her life.

        However, fate seemed to have a cruel sense of humor.

        Mistilteinn killed Zeboiim, in an act of mutual destruction.

        Zeboiim’s death shook the core of phantocaudas. To secure her power, Gomorrah pushed herself past her limits, training and competing. Her relentless efforts ultimately made her the youngest one-tailed phantocauda and deservedly the new chieftain.

        Everything Gomorrah did was to protect Sodom, the only alienated being in the clan, and to secure a voice among the phantocaudas, she must hold onto the title and power of being the chieftain.

        To ensure Sodom’s safety, Gomorrah had no choice but to keep her distance, giving the other phantocaudas the false idea that she only regarded Sodom as a mere slaughter tool, a possession. However, the sprout of affection in her heart continued to grow and eventually culminated in an overpowering love that erupted during a battle where she became delirious due to serious injuries.

        The fever left Gomorrah in a vulnerable state. Guided by her instinct to seek solace from the one she trusted most, she unconsciously assumed her human form and stumbled toward Sodom’s cell. However, her feeble body failed to endure the strain and collapsed halfway. Just then, someone approached, lifted her up, and carried her back to the main chamber in the cavern. 

        “So… Sodom…”  In her misted vision induced by the fever, she saw a delicate figure. She reflexively grasped her arm and forcefully planted a kiss on her lips. The figure initially trembled but soon relaxed, accepting Gomorrah’s invitation of intimacy.

        The long-suppressed desires became unstoppable the moment they were unleashed. That night, Gomorrah released the beastly primal nature within her and she fell into a deep slumber soon after her thirst was satiated. She only awakened when the sunlight of the following noon streamed into the chamber. Yet, she opened her eyes only to find the woman lying beside her was not Sodom.

        “Zoar…” Gomorrah looked at Zoar, Admah’s little sister, with a complex gaze. Just then, Zoar also roused from her sleep and met Gomorrah’s gaze with a tender one.

        “Don’t worry, I won’t speak a word to anyone,” said Zoar, blinking her eyes which were filled with calculated appeasement. “You can pretend I’m anyone you want me to be.”

        “...Let’s forget about what happened last night,” said Gomorrah.

        “Wait. We can be together like we did when we were little. We used to be so close, remember? I want to stay by your side now, too,” Zoar affectionately pleaded.

        “I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Just go.”

        Zoar’s plea for reconciliation was met with cold rejection since Gomorrah had already seen through her true colors. Her calculated gestures of “love” only disgusted Gomorrah and filled her with guilt about betraying Sodom’s trust.
　
        The overwhelming emotions made it difficult for Gomorrah to find peace in solitude. After Zoar left, she quietly traversed the dense forest near the phantocaudas’ cavern until she reached a secluded hill where a cave was formed at the end of the slope.

        Gomorrah entered the cave and took a few steps before she saw a colossal figure—

        It was a massive dragon in a state of utter ruin. Its wings were reduced to skeletal frames, its body riddled with craters, some still oozing pus. Yet, the dragon’s immense eyes were vacant, devoid of focus, as if it could not feel the pain. One would normally assume the dragon was dead if its body did not heave with each breath.

        “Mistilteinn...” Gomorrah approached and prostrated herself upon the dragon’s body, the same way she had done when she was little. Then, she murmured, “It turns out I’m a phantocauda, a beast driven by desires after all. I can’t bring Sodom happiness.”

        Back then, when Mistilteinn murdered Zeboiim, her consciousness shattered along with her core sword but her resilient body remained alive. While the other phantocaudas were occupied with Zeboiim’s after-death arrangements, Gomorrah clandestinely spirited Mistilteinn away, hiding her in this secluded cave.

        “Now I understand what you told me back then,” Gomorrah continued, “The world is changing. Bloodshed and dominance is no longer the only solution. Multiple races are seeking ways to coexist and establish peace, but it’s too late for us. We phantocaudas have been steeped in bloodbath for too many years and we have reached the point of no return; it’s our destiny to bear the weight of our sins until the day of judgment arrives.”

        Gomorrah raised her head, gazing at Mistilteinn’s soulless shell. With resolve and contrition, she spoke, “I am equally guilty as all the other phantocaudas, so I do not seek redemption or forgiveness. But I will protect Sodom…Joan from punishment.”</p>
