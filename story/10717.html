        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 5

        In the depths of the forest, the young floral-elf, Lilac, awakened from her peaceful slumber. She stepped out of her wooden cottage and stretched her delicate body lazily under the morning sun. She then proceeded to freshen herself up with some water in the large porcelain jug, but to her dismay, the jug was empty. So, she went back to the cottage where her mother was standing in the living room and said, “Mom, we ran out of water. I’ll go to the lake and get us some there.”

        “What? Why now, of all moments? The beasts have been hunting elves lately, and it’s dangerous outside… Maybe we just live without water for a while?”  Lilac’s mother said with her hand on her cheek, her face filled with worry.

        “No! Who knows how long those beasts’ rampage is going to last? I can’t live that long without water,” Lilac complained, then she put her hands around her mother’s arm and began badgering her, “Besides, the lake is close to our home. There’s no need to worry.”

        “Well… Alright, but please be careful and come home safe.” her mother finally relented.

        “I got it, Mom. You know I’m a fast runner!” said Lilac, flashing a radiant smile. Then, she swiftly rushed out of the cottage and traversed the dense forest until she reached the shimmering lake. However, instead of collecting water right away, she reveled in the joy of exploring the woods for a while, before eventually taking out her jug and filling it with water at a leisurely pace.

        Unbeknownst to Lilac, time had slipped away, and it was midday. Since she had thoroughly enjoyed herself, she decided to return home with the weighty jug on her shoulder.

        ‘That’s strange… Why is it so quiet around here? No birds chirping and no bugs buzzing…’ Lilac furrowed her brows in concern after walking a short distance. ‘And there’s a floral scent… No, not just one, but multiple ones, mixed…’

        Lilac’s carefree demeanor gradually turned into unease, and her feeling of anxiety finally erupted when she stumbled upon a gruesome scene along the path—a number of floral-elves lay lifeless before her.

        “Ahhhhh!”

        The gory sight of her kin’s tragic end struck Lilac and threw her into sheer panic. The jug slipped from her grasp and crashed to the ground.

        Bang!

        The water spilled all over the ground, saturating the earth like the sap seeping from the vicious wounds on the elves’ bodies. In fact, the floral scents Lilac detected earlier came from the sap, forming an ethereal yet haunting fragrance as they intertwined in the air.

        “No… no… no…” Overwhelmed by the horrific sight, Lilac could only cradle her head and murmured incoherently in helplessness. It was only when she remembered her mother that she returned to the present.

        “Mom! I-I have to go back!” Lilac began running. Although she stumbled over rocks at the first few steps, she managed to steady herself and hastened toward her home. Unexpectedly, on her way, she came across a petite figure standing still—a girl of around thirteen or fourteen years old, with an otherworldly beauty, innocently surveying the ground.

        ‘That’s a…a girl… What is she doing in this remote forest? Could she be lost? It’s dangerous here now and she may get into trouble. I can’t leave her alone here.’ These thoughts raced through Lilac’s mind.

        And so, she slowed her pace and approached the girl, offering words of caution, “It’s dangerous…here…”

        However, her words soon faded to silence as the whole picture came into sight—several lifeless floral-elves lying strewn before the girl, their bodies brutally slain. In her right hand was a large sword dripping with sap, offering unequivocal evidence that she was the one responsible for their demise. 

        “Ru-run… Ah!” A severely injured floral-elf, on the verge of death, struggled to raise her body and issue a warning to the petrified Lilac. However, the girl impaled her with a swift thrust of her sword, sending her into eternal slumber before she could finish her words.

        After finishing the floral-elf, the girl turned her gaze on Lilac. With a clear voice, yet somehow tinged with a slight stammer, she uttered, “Floral-elves, they bully Gomorrah, have to die.”

        ‘Sh-she is going to kill me! I have to run!’ The instinct for survival jolted Lilac out of her paralysis, and she hastily turned and ran back along the path she came from. 

        However, the girl was faster than Lilac, narrowing the distance with a few agile leaps, until she was within a breath’s reach, her hand poised to snatch the trailing fabric of Lilac’s garments.

        ‘If she catches me, I’ll die… And I-I don’t want to die!’ Lilac hurriedly tapped into her powers. In an instant, several flower buds sprouted from her body and rapidly bloomed into plump fruits.

        “Go!” At Lilac’s command, the fruits shot forth, aiming directly at the approaching girl.

        Unperturbed, the girl swiftly wielded her sword and cleaved through the darting fruits, splitting each one in half, only to cause the juice to splatter across her face.

        “Ugh!” With her vision obstructed by the juice, the girl could only halt her pursuit and frantically wipe the liquid from her face, unaware that her bracelet slipped from her right wrist in her haste.

        ‘She fell for it!’ Lilac rejoiced, seizing the opportunity to quicken her steps and run as far away as possible. Still, she knew that the unpoisonous juice would not hold the girl for long, and given the girl’s speed, it was only a matter of time before she caught up with her.

        ‘I need to find a way to get rid of her… I guess I have no choice but to take a gamble!’ After pondering for a moment, Lilac bit her lower lip and decisively changed direction, running toward the lake.

        Even amidst the dreadful carnage, the lake remained calm and peaceful in the forest, glinting in the sunlight. Lilac stood anxiously by the lakeside, waiting until she heard rustling sounds coming from the woods. Then she took a deep breath and stealthily let herself sink into the depths of the water.

        Before long, the girl arrived at the lakeside.

        Covering her mouth and nose underwater, Lilac peered through the thick curtain of water as she watched the girl’s figure pass the lake while quietly praying for the girl to leave quickly.

        Unfortunately, her prayer went unanswered.

        Just before walking away from the lakeside, the girl stopped, closed her eyes, and focused on the sound she heard. Then, a sweet smile tinged with an unsettling air of mystery spread across her face as she said in her lovely voice, “Found you.”

        With the sword clasped in her hand, the girl strode back toward the lake.  Lilac closed her eyes in despair, bracing herself for a bleak end.

        “Sodom, we have to go.” Suddenly, a female voice halted the girl.

        “Huh?” The girl, Sodom, tilted her head slightly, looking toward the three-tailed phantocauda that emerged from the forest. Confused, she asked, “But, I haven’t killed all the floral-elves yet.”

        “Gomorrah says we stop,” the beast said.

        “Okay, Sodom stops then,” Sodom said with an obedient nod as she heard it was Gomorrah’s command.

        After the girl left with the phantocauda, Lilac, narrowly escaping the clutches of death, emerged from the water. Drenched from head to toe, she slumped down onto the ground, gasping for air. It took a while for her to calm down, and there she sat in a daze, gradually realizing a profound truth.

        ‘I… I survived…’

        The belated realization flooded her with unbridled joy which yet ceased when she thought of her mother’s uncertain fate. She immediately stood up and ran toward her home. Along the way, she noticed the girl’s bracelet on the ground and she picked it up. Little did she know that the bracelet held a staggering secret…</p>
