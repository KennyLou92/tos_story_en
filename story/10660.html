        Galactic Odyssey - Ch. 1

        [b][i]– Day 36,524 – Flight hours: 87,658

        The cosmic conditions are favorable today, with clear visibility and no disturbances. It’s a perfect day for patrol. It’s also a special day as it marks the completion of my century-long journey with Montana in just twelve short hours.

        A hundred years ago, Montana and I ventured into the barren reaches of the galaxy, carrying out a mission to uphold universal safety. We have patrolled the vast expanse of space while steadfastly adhering to the ten thousand and eight cruising regulations.

        Now, our prolonged journey is nearing its end, and in just twelve hours, we will be returning home, back to the bustling star system, to our final destination—Spiral Star, the planet of machinas—concluding our hundred-year patrol mission. After that, I will—[/i][/b]

        “Scáthach, our routine patrol will start in five minutes,” a mechanical male voice resonated from the ceiling of the study. The tone was mild and grounded, yet devoid of emotional warmth.

        A machina girl, immersed in her work at the desk, jolted upright and shouted anxiously, “What?!”

        “According to Article 11 of the Daily Operations section in the Cruise Regulations, the Guide of the battlecruiser must commence a 210-minute patrol at precisely 9 o’clock Tarones morning time. Routine tasks include clearing cosmic debris and inspecting potential space crises. It is now 8:55 in Tarones…8:56. You still have four minutes to prepare,” the voice calmly added.

        “Oh no! I’m going to be late!” The machina girl, Scáthach, who was the Guide of the battleship named Montana, could only stop writing her journal. She hastily scribbled her name on the crystal screen, ending her record of the day. Then, she hurriedly left the study and headed straight to the control room.

        In her haste, Scáthach nearly stumbled, but she managed to steady herself by grabbing onto the wall. Finally, in the last possible second, she arrived at the control room and activated the patrol system, allowing herself to breathe a sigh of relief.

        “Monty is such a meanie. Why didn’t he remind me earlier? I almost lost my unblemished record as the best Guide in the universe!” Scáthach pouted and grumbled under her breath, thinking that Montana would not hear her. However, the battleship itself, Montana, sensed everything happening on board.

        “Correction, my official designation is not Monty, it’s Montana, model 005 of the battlecruiser series,” the male voice spoke again, this time with a hint of resignation. “I reminded you thirty minutes ago, but at that time, you didn’t listen to me, instead you asked me to remind you only five minutes prior.”

        “Oh… I guess that did happen,” Scáthach awkwardly scratched her cheek, then mustered a bright smile and said energetically, “Well, let’s not dwell on what happened. Monty, let’s get to work!”

        “...Yes,” said Montana, who remained silent for a while before finally giving up on correcting Scáthac. “Activating search mode.”

“Alright, let’s make the space impeccable today!” Scáthach, oblivious to Montana’s resignation, raised her hands with enthusiasm. They carried out their routine patrol duties just like the way they had done for the past ninety-nine years, and they successfully cleared several batches of cosmic debris.

        After completing the search operation, Scáthach left the control room and made her way to the incineration chamber on the lower deck. It was one of her duties to inspect the collected space debris and ensure that no unintended biological entities were captured before sending the debris to the incinerator for destruction, breaking them down into elemental dust, and letting them out back to space.

        While Scáthach looked into the debris, a promotional flyer caught her attention. She pulled it out forcefully and smoothed out the creases on the paper. Slowly, she read the words printed on the flyer: “Heptara Unies… Establishment Day Celebration… Special Discount on Candies.. 50% Off…”

        Scáthach gently caressed the vibrant townscape depicted on the flyer, her eyes filled with a visible longing and yearning. It was a desire that had grown through a century of monotonous and repetitive life. She gazed at the unique tower on the paper, which represented the headquarters of the Heptara Unies.

        “It’s the Heptara Unies again… I’ve seen this name on other space debris before. It is said that the headquarters is magnificent. I wish I could see it with my own eyes someday…”

        “Scáthach, have you finished inspecting the space debris? Anything unusual?” Montana took the initiative to inquire, seeing Scáthach standing in silence.

        “Huh?” Montana’s voice pulled Scáthach out of her thoughts. She reflexively hid the flyer in her hand, and said, “Oh, y-yes, I’ve done inspecting the debris. Everything is normal. We can proceed with the incineration.”

        Montana fell silent for a while before he resignedly and solemnly stated, “According to Article 233 of the Daily Operations section in the Cruise Regulations/Cruising Guide’s Code of Conduct, it is strictly prohibited to take possession of any unconstitutional space debris.”

        “Wh-what are you talking about? I-I have no idea,”  Scáthach tightened her grip on the flyer, pretending to be oblivious. However, her poorly inexperienced disguise could not fool anyone, let alone the all-knowing Montana.

        “Scáthach, do you still want to be the best Guide?” Montana resorted to his trump card since his attempts at persuasion were proved futile.

        Tempted by the grand title “the Best Guide”, Scáthach naturally succumbed and handed over the flyer hidden in her hand. Yet, her adorable face was filled with discontent. With her lips formed into an angry pout, she stomped her feet and shouted, “Monty is the worst!”

        Then she turned and ran out of the incineration chamber, heading straight for her room on the fourth floor. She burrowed herself under the covers, wrapping the blanket tightly around her in a fit of sulking for nearly a minute before a metallic arm removed her blanket.

        Standing before Scáthach was a humanoid male figure made of metal. It was a remote terminal that Montana had reconstructed from the battleship’s metallic components. He would use it whenever necessary, and usually, it was about Scáthach.

        “What is it again?” Montana asked softly while his metallic hand gently and intermittently stroked Scáthach's short hair, trying to comfort her.

        “Monty, you old fossil! Stupid metal!”

        “...We’re born on the same day.”

        “N-no, that’s not true! I came two hours and eleven minutes after you!” Scáthach sat up straight, glaring at Montana, complaining displeasedly, “It’s just a flyer, why wouldn’t you let me keep it?”

        “The rules must be followed, but…” Montana paused as he took out a new flyer from his pocket, meticulously recreated based on the design of the previous one, even more exquisite than the original. “I can make you happy in another way.”

        Scáthach eagerly leaned toward Montana and grabbed the flyer with both hands. Her eyes lit up with excitement as she looked at Montana and asked in astonishment, “Did you draw this?”

        “Yes— Oh!” Montana’s words were interrupted as Scáthach gave him an enthusiastic hug while exclaiming with immense joy, “Monty, you’re the best!”

        After releasing Montana from her embrace, Scáthach raised the flyer high. Together, they gazed at the tower depicted in the flyer. Filled with anticipation, she said, “Let’s go see the Enochian Tower together once we finish our mission.”

        “...Sure.”

        Excited by Montana’s agreement, Scáthach elatedly shared her retirement plans with Montana, but their leisurely reverie was interrupted by a sudden shrill alarm.

        “What’s happening?!” Scáthach immediately asked.

        “A star about five light years away is about to die, it is going to collapse within half an hour,” Montana replied, his tone subtly tinged with concern. “I’ll head back to the control room now.”

        “Alright, I’ll be there in a minute!”

        Montana’s android disappeared into the wall, and Scáthach also regained her composure as a Guide, covering her childlike side and focusing on her mission. She hurried back to the control room and placed her hands on the control panel, connecting to the battleship.

        “Requesting activation of Special Emergency Operation A434 for multiple space jumps,” Scáthach inputted the command.

        “Request received, permission granted. Special Emergency Operation A434 mode activated. Prepare for the first space jump. Counting down: ten, nine, eight, seven—”

        ‘We need three jumps to avoid the impact of the collapsing star, but we don’t have enough time! What should we do?’ Scáthach piloted the battleship while continuously pondering how to shorten the jump preparation time. Finally, she came up with a solution.

        After completing the first and second space jumps, as Montana prepared for the third jump, Scáthach opened her core that served as the power source and connected it to the control panel, channeling the core’s power into the battleship.

        “Scáthach! What are you doing?! Stop it! This will drain all your energy, rendering you immobile!” Montana exclaimed in rare frustration, but Scáthach smiled in relief.

        “It’s okay, Monty. This is the only way to shorten the jump time and avoid the impact of the collapse.”

        “...Even if we’re affected by the shockwave, it will only cause 30% damage to the battleship. It won't have any effect on you. You shouldn’t have done this.”
 
        “But I don’t want to see you get hurt, Monty,” Scáthach weakly supported herself on the control panel. “Besides, it’s too late to stop me now, haha.”

        “...Proceeding with the third jump,” Montana declared with frustration. They successfully moved to a safe zone just before the impact of the planet’s collapse hit them.

        At the moment of arrival, as Scáthach exhausted her strength and stumbled forward, a pair of sturdy metallic arms caught her—Montana once again held her with his android.

        “Never do it again.”

        “I won’t, I won’t,” Scáthach reassured, leaning comfortably against Montana’s body. Meanwhile, a melodious tune resonated through the entire battleship, soon followed by a gentle female voice.

        “Montana the battlecruiser, and Scáthach the Guide, my name is Gamma. I am your creator. Congratulations on completing your century-long patrol mission. I hereby declare that you will return to the Spiral Star, the homeworld of the machinas. Wish you all the best on your journey back.”

        After the voice faded, Scáthach and Montana remained silent, as if they had not fully detached themselves from their hundred-year-long mission. It was only after a long, long time that Scáthach chuckled, eventually bursting into hearty laughter.

        “Monty, we can finally leave the barren zones of the galaxy.”

        “Yes. I’ve adjusted the course, and we’ll soon enter the bustling zones,” said Montana. As he raised his hand, the wall in front of the control room turned translucent, revealing the vast universe outside.

        Even though they were only on the outskirts of the bustling zones, they could still see the lively, vibrant planets floating within. It was a stark contrast to the barren zones and dying planets they had seen over the past century.

        Scáthach stepped forward and placed her hands against the translucent wall with vivid excitement. She gazed intently at the beautiful cosmic vista, filled with hope and anticipation for the future. 

        Little did she know that a cruel and grim reality awaited her and Montana...
