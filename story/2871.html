        <h1>Dauntless Figure - Zhongli Quan</h1>
        <p>
                 Ever since Zhongli Quan’s love for Xiao Zi had turned out to be unrequited, he locked himself up in his house, gazing upon the moon with a glass of wine in his hand and tears in his eyes every night.

         “Why does Xiao Zi disdain such a handsome and charming Xian like me?” Zhongli Quan muttered to himself while staring at his reflection in the mirror, clad in the same unchanged clothes for years. Suddenly, an epiphany struck him.

         “Of course! There must be something wrong with my clothes! If only I had a stylish outfit, I would undoubtedly become the most dashing Xian in the entire Heavenly Kingdom!”

         With this thought in mind, Zhongli Quan began to design his new clothes with great fervor. Days went by, during which he even skipped sleep and meals, completely engrossed in sketching his new garments. Finally, he completed the drawings. Clutching the stack of sketches, he went out in search of materials only to collide head-on with Cao Guojiu as he opened the door. His sketches were all scattered across the floor.

         Dizzy and seeing stars, Zhongli Quan clumsily propped himself up from the ground. A mournful cry escaped his lips when he noticed the wind carried away the scattered sketches. Rubbing his slightly swollen forehead, he yelled, “My sketches! Cao Guojiu, did you come here to pick a fight?”

         As Zhongli Quan prepared to brawl with Cao Guojiu as he had done countless times before, he was taken aback by the uncharacteristic behavior of his rival. Instead of engaging in an argument, Cao Guojiu wore a grave expression. “Give me your Xian energy,” he said anxiously.

         “You just expect me to give you my power just like that?” Zhongli Quan replied, astonished by the request.

         “...Please.” Cao Guojiu lowered his pride and implored after a brief moment of hesitation.

         “Huh?” Zhongli Quan was truly surprised. After years of bickering and fighting, he had never seen Cao Guojiu bow down like this. As curiosity got the better of him, he could not help but ask, “What’s going on?”

         Cao Guojiu told Zhongli Quan what had happened. A few days earlier, Han Xiangzi had used those very handcuffs to shackle Cao Guojiu and Zhongli Quan together. It was after a fierce battle that the two Xians finally managed to subdue Han Xiangzi and force him to remove the handcuffs.
　　
         Cao Guojiu had taken the handcuffs home. Little did he know that Zhongli Quan and his powers had infused the handcuffs and helped the artifact develop sentience, giving birth to a spirit called Xiao Suo. However, without the nourishment of Zhongli Quan’s Xian energy, Xiao Suo could not maintain its form and would eventually vanish.

         “I see… But if I were to offer my Xian energy to nurture the spirit, I might be unable to use my power freely for several days. Plus, I still need to venture into the human realm to gather materials for my new garments. What if I encounter demons along the way? It would be a dead end,” Zhongli Quan said. But as soon as he observed the anxious look on Cao Guojiu’s face, he changed his mind, “But, I guess I can give you a helping hand if you help me gather one of the materials.”

         “Deal! Xiao Suo is currently resting in the handcuffs. Just keep them with you. It should help him stabilize his form, ” Cao Guojiu responded.

         Then, Cao Guojiu hurriedly flew away soon after Zhongli Quan told him where to get the material.

         Carrying the handcuffs in his pockets, Zhongli Quan descended to the human realm. He headed to a vast forest and ventured into the depths until nightfall when he finally arrived at his destination—the Silver Moon Lake.

         According to ancient records, there existed a magical silk thread within the Silver Moon Lake. Only by scooping up the reflection of the full moon from the center of the lake could one obtain it. It was said that clothing woven from this silk thread would possess an ethereal beauty.

         And so, Zhongli Quan channeled his power to float above the water’s surface. He bent down and reached into the lake. As he raised his hand once more, several strands of silver-glowing silk thread lay in his palm.

         “It’s truly exquisite. Clothing made from this silk thread will undoubtedly complement my charming appearance. I should gather more while the moon is still high— Argh!”

         Just as Zhongli Quan became enraptured by the silver threads, an enormous fish suddenly leaped out of the water, catching hold of his legs and dragging him into the lake before he could react.

         Zhongli Quan attempted to muster his power to resist, only to feel an odd chill creeping from his legs to his entire body. His power seemed to congeal, rendering it ineffectual.

         “It’s poison!  The fish’s teeth are poisonous, preventing me from utilizing my Xian energy! Damn it!”

         No matter how hard Zhongli Quan struggled, he was still slowly dragged down to the lake’s depths. Just as he was on the brink of losing consciousness, a golden light shimmered from his clothes.

         From the light emerged a translucent boy, grasping Zhongli Quan’s hand to pull him to the water’s surface. Yet, his strength proved insufficient against the formidable fish which pulled the both of them down to the lake’s bottom.

         The boy was none other than the spirit of the handcuffs, Xiao Suo. Although he had already lost the ability to maintain his physical humanoid form, he still forcefully materialized upon sensing Zhongli Quan was in grave danger.

         “It’s so cold…so dark…and scary here, but… I have to save Dad!” A determined yet childish voice rang in Zhongli Quan’s mind, awakening his consciousness. He opened his eyes to see a resolute little face and felt a warm touch.

         A comforting warmth flowed from the boy’s hand into Zhongli Quan’s body, dispelling the poison within him. But as the boy’s power flowed into Zhongli Quan, his limbs began to fade and disappear.

         “He actually sacrificed himself to save me... even if it means he would vanish?” Zhongli Quan felt a sudden burn in his nose, and a silent flame ignited within him.

         Free from poison, Zhongli Quan clenched his teeth and unleashed a powerful blast of energy, pushing the monstrous fish away.

         As Zhongli Quan broke free, he took off the fan on his back and fiercely struck at the bottom, creating a tremendous force that propelled him and Xiao Suo out of the water in an instant.

         Back on the shore, Zhongli Quan began to relentlessly pour his Xian energy into Xiao Suo’s body. Seeing the frail and pale appearance of the spirit, he could not help but feel a mix of guilt and gratitude.

         “Hey, you, hang in there! Cao Guojiu will give me trouble if you disappear like this!”

         “Dad…”

         “Cao Guojiu isn’t here. I’m not your dad,” Zhongli Quan said, even as he continued to transfer his Xian energy. It was after he had exhausted his power that the fading figure of Xiao Suo finally stabilized.

         “But you are my dad… And this is what you were looking for, right?” The weak little boy raised a bundle of silver threads.

         In Xiao Suo’s hand were indeed the magical threads from the Silver Moon Lake.

         Zhongli Quan was inexplicably moved by the sight of the threads in his hand.

         Zhongli Quan brought the weakened Xiao Suo back home and met with Cao Guojiu, who had already gathered the material as requested. As Cao Guojiu saw Xiao Suo, he unexpectedly held him tightly. Witnessing the intimate connection between the Xian and the spirit. Zhongli Quan could not help but feel a strange sense of envy.

         “Xiao Suo, let’s go home.”

         “Wait.” Zhongli Quan intercepted them. “Xiao Suo has great potential. I think it’d be better for him to stay and be my assistant!”

         “You expect me to say yes? No!” Cao Guojiu retorted with discontent.

         “I’m not asking you! I’m asking Xiao Suo!” Zhongli Quan stubbornly replied. 

         “I’m his father, so my decision counts!”

         “Oh, so what? I’m also his dad!”

         “Humph, why don’t we just ask Xiao Suo what he wants?”

         “Fine, ask him! You don’t scare me!”

         “Xiao Suo, who are you choosing? Me or this fat pig?”

         “Humph, I’m definitely a better choice compared to a schmuck like you.”

         “Huh? You’re both my dads. How could I choose between you… How about we take turns? Is that okay?” Xiao Suo raised a pleading smile while holding and gently swinging both of his two fathers’ hands. His action melted Zhongli Quan and Cao Guojiu’s hearts, and they both agreed to his suggestion.

         From then on, whenever Zhongli Quan and Cao Guojiu met, they would argue as usual, but Xiao Suo would always calm them down before their fight escalated, bringing a peaceful atmosphere to the Heavenly Kingdoms…</p>
