        <h1>Shinpachi Shimura</h1>
        <p>
        The son of a kendo doujo owner, which has become completely desolate after his father’s death and the Sword Ban.

He once worked part-time but he wasn’t satisfied with being a cashier.

Since Gintoki saved his sister from the debt collector, he started to work in Yorozuya so as to learn from Gintoki’s spirit.
But soon he regretted his decision…

He is also the Imperial Guards of the recent pop-idol, Tsuu Terakado.</p>
