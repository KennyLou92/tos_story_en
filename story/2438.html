        <h1>Tangy Tenderness - Mangosteen</h1>
        <p>
                At a corner of the Lost Relic, there was a garden where the ancient god’s servant and the fruit elves resided.

        Earlier, the ancient god’s servant, also the master of the elves, was put into a coma by sickness. With the collective effort of all elves, he regained his health, and the garden started thriving again.

        However, something was about to happen in the peaceful days…

        The weather was lovely today with strands of sunlight beaming through trees, leaving a relaxing shadow on the soil.

        “Hey guys! What’s this?”

        A pair of good-looking teenagers were cleaning the garden. The girl found something on the altar at a quiet corner of the garden.

        That was a worn crown.

        “A crown? Is it something left by the ancient god?” the handsome Blueberry took the crown to examine.

        “Hey hey! Don’t touch something that isn’t yours! It must belong to Master. Master! We’ve found something strange here!” The pretty, confident girl Mangosteen shouted, calling the orchard owner at the opposite side.

        “That is the Crown of Sincerity,” the orchard owner said with a gentle smile. “The lore said that it was left by the ancient god. Only the love of the crown owner could wear it.”

        The orchard owner returned to his work after telling Mangosteen and Blueberry about the crown. As for the two elves, they remained in the same position staring at the crown.

        “The love of the crown owner...Does that mean the favorite one?” Blueberry mumbled, “well, who is Master’s favorite elf?”

        “Why bother to ask? Must be me!” A hint of confidence appeared on Mangosteen’s gorgeous face. She spoke with her exquisite palm on her chest, “everyone loves a perfect elf like me!”

        “Aw, look at how confident you are,” said Blueberry with a grin. “Why don’t we ask Master tomorrow that who is his favorite?”

        “Humph! Deal!” Mangosteen glared at Blueberry. “You’re way out of the league!”

        Mangosteen was merely bragging.

        The orchard owner was surrounded by all kinds of fruit elves. Not only Blueberry who got along well with everyone, but there were also Green Apple who was the first-born elf, the cool Cherry and the cute Banana...With all these competitive opponents, was Mangosteen really his favorite?

        What could she do to make her master love her? Mangosteen couldn’t figure it out.

        Same day in the afternoon, Mangosteen went to the market to buy fertilizer for the orchard owner. When she was shopping, she ran into a jaw-dropping beauty.

        The lady was breath-takingly beautiful, and Mangosteen had never seen such a gorgeous one.

        Looking closer, Mangosteen saw a few fox tails on the lady’s back...Was she Daji the legendary vixen? She also noticed the handsome man walking with the beauty, who resembled Daji’s lover Jiang Ziya.

        Mangosteen had heard from the others that Daji was an expert in bewitchment, who even captured Jiang Ziya’s heart. 

        “Let’s ask if Daji can teach me some tricks!” With this thought, Mangosteen strode towards Daji.

        “...Did you just ask me how to bewitch someone?”

        Daji raised her eyebrow and scanned Mangosteen after hearing her out.

        “Yes, I wanna win against the other elves...I can’t lose!”

        Mangosteen put on a grim, swearing not to lose to Blueberry.

        “Oh? Interesting...How about this? You sit down first.”

        Pressing Jiang Ziya’s shoulder, Daji pushed him to a closed stall and made him sit on a low table.

        “Hmm?” The perplexed Jiang Ziya had no choice but to sit down.

        Next second, Daji lifted the hem of her dress and sat on Jiang Ziya’s lap, pressing her curvaceous body on him. 

        “Well, no man can resist if you’re seductive enough. Right?”

        Daji moved from tilting Jiang Ziya’s chin to stroking his lips with her fingertip; Then she leant close while licking her own juicy lip. Their lips were only an inch away from each other, turning the ambience flirty.

        “Is...is this what I have to do to Master?” Mangosteen was blushing completely as she witnessed the whole seducing scene.

        “Stop messing around…” Jiang Ziya avoided Daji’s flirt and turned to Blueberry.

        “Little girl...I don’t know who you are trying to impress, but sincerity is the most important thing in a relationship. If you want someone to be good to you, you must be good to them first,” said Jiang Ziya.

        “Sincerity…” Mangosteen lowered her head.

        “That’s right,” Daji spoke as she laid her head on Jiang Ziya’s shoulder. “I didn’t capture his heart with witchcraft, but I fell in love with him.”

        When Jiang Ziya heard Daji’s confession, a blush appeared on his handsome face. He managed to keep calm and spoke to Mangosteen again.

        “Little girl, listen to me. If you love someone, you must tell him, or you would end up like us missing each other earlier.”

        “Luckily we confessed to each other～Honey!” Daji threw herself into Jiang Ziya’s embrace affectionately and almost made out with him.

        “Behave yourself! Someone else is watching!”

        All Mangosteen did was ask one question and it turned her into the third wheel…

        After getting the fertilizer, Mangosteen returned to the garden and sat down pondering. 

        It was hard for her to comprehend what Daji and Jiang Ziya had said to her.

        Still, she was confident to herself as she clenched her fists.

        “I must win this bet with Blueberry!”</p>
