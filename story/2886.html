        <h1>Born to Skate - Alpha and Beta</h1>
        <p>        “Alpha! Alpha! Pompeii built a new ramp yesterday! Let’s go test it—” shouted Beta the machina, who forcefully pushed open the door only to find his twin Alpha idly lounging on the bed. Furrowing his brow, he yelled, “Why are you sleeping again?!”

        “Get up! Stop sleeping!” Beta strode toward Alpha and grabbed his arms, shaking him vigorously.

        “Ugh… Stop it… I feel dizzy,” Alpha weakly protested as he was jolted awake from his slumber.

        “Good! You’re awake!” Beta flashed a bright smile upon seeing Alpha awake. Yet, instead of releasing his grip on his brother’s arms, he loudly exclaimed, “Let’s go and see the ramp now!”

        “But…I thought we already skateboarded all day yesterday…”

        “Forget yesterday, it’s a brand new day! Besides, exercise is good. You need to move your body more, or your joints will seize up!”

        “...No, I want to sleep.” Decisively, Alpha gave up changing his brother’s mind and closed his eyes, determined to go back to sleep.

        “Alpha! Hey, hey! Alpha! Hey, hey!” Beta shouted. However, Alpha remained resolute and turned a deaf ear to him, trying his best to fall back asleep.

        “You think you can get away from me by sleeping? Humph! Not a chance!” Alpha’s stubbornness only fueled Beta’s determination. Carrying Alpha on his shoulders, Beta marched toward the sports ground. To his surprise, Alpha remained sound asleep throughout the journey and even started snoring upon reaching the ramp, leaving Beta so infuriated that he punched a wall twice and left two shallow dents in it.

        “Dang it! This guy does sleep like a pig!” Beta glared at Alpha, who stayed peacefully in dreamland no matter what he did. He had no choice but to give up in frustration. “Forget it, he just doesn’t appreciate the fun of the new ramp. I’ll go skateboarding by myself…”

        Just then, a female machina entered the sports ground and captured Beta’s attention.

        ‘That’s the Earthling who has been mechanized recently… What’s her name..Sch…Schnauzer!’ Beta observed the machina and noticed the lingering melancholy in her expression. A thought came to his mind: ‘She hasn’t joined any of our activities. She must be having a hard time adjusting to her new identity. Let me teach her how to skateboard on the ramp. That will surely help break the ice between her and us machinas!’

        Filled with inexplicable confidence and enthusiasm, Beta waved toward Schnauzer and said, “Hey! Schnauzer, would you like to skateboard on the ramp with me? Pompeii built a new one yesterday, and it’s going to be fun.”

        “...And you are?” In stark contrast to Beta’s enthusiasm, Schnauzer remained aloof, looking at him with obvious distrust. Undeterred, Beta continued his enthusiastic invitation, “I’m Beta. I know you’ve been transformed into a machina just recently, and you may be having a rough time with your new body, but I think skateboarding on the ramp might help you get familiar with it. And I can teach you, so come on!”

        Without waiting for Schnauzer’s response, Beta grabbed her wrist and dragged her to the front of the ramp. Ignoring the fact that she might not be interested in joining him, Beta began explaining the basic knowledge and techniques of skateboarding, growing more excited as he spoke. Finally, acting like a cool mentor, he said, “Let me show you how to do it.” 

        Then, Beta impatiently leaped onto the ramp. Elements gathered beneath his feet as he harnessed his powers, coalescing into a powerful force that defied gravity. His body rocketed skyward, turning into a tiny silhouette against the azure sky. In this fleeting moment of aerial freedom, he spun his body and performed a series of jaw-dropping acrobatic movements. After that, he smoothly descended onto the ramp and lowered his body to slow down the speed while stabilizing his posture before leaping off the ramp and eagerly walking back to Schnauzer.

        “What do you think?”

        “...It was alright,” Schnauzer hesitated for a moment before responding.

        “Right? I knew no one could resist the charm of the ramp!” Beta exclaimed in excitement, “Come on, you try it now!”

        While nudging Schnauzer toward the ramp, Beta encouraged her, saying, “You might not grasp the techniques right away and you might fall, but don’t worry, Practice makes per…fect… Uh…How…How is this possible?”

        Beta’s voice tailed off as he saw Schnauzer’s slender figure leaping gracefully into the air. She reached even greater heights than him and her acrobatic movements were more beautiful and complicated than his. Schnauzer’s performance filled Beta with disbelief. He remained completely dumbfounded until Schnauzer returned to the ground.

        “Are you... okay?” Schnauzer asked softly.

        “No… Not okay… A beginner just broke my record… No! I have to redeem myself!” The unexpected spectacle ignited a sense of rivalry within Beta. He dashed toward the ramp, leaving Schnauzer behind. The air cracked as he unleashed all his powers, while a gust of wind swept through the sports ground and gathered clouds of dust.

        Alpha, still sleeping in a corner of the sports ground, inevitably inhaled some of the swirling dust. The tickling sensation in his nostrils jolted him awake, compelling him to sneeze. He slowly opened his eyes only to witness the moment Beta lost his balance due to the hasty acceleration, which swept away his drowsiness in an instant.

        “Beta that idiot is causing trouble again!” Alpha muttered through gritted teeth. Simultaneously, he tapped into his powers. A pair of mechanical wings spread behind him, allowing him to soar straight toward Beta, who was about to plummet to the ground, like a lightning bolt.

        Boom!

        A loud bang resounded as the tremendous collision occurred and culminated in a shallow crater on the ground. Fortunately, Alpha managed to prevent Beta’s body from shattering into pieces. With his arms around the waist of Beta, whose head was still spinning, he slowly descended to the ground.

        The first thing Alpha did after landing safely was to give Beta a hard punch at the back of his head.

        “Ouch! That hurts!” Beta groaned, clutching the back of his head in pain, while Alpha coldly said, “You deserve it!”

        “Why are you being so mean to me…” Beta complained but soon surrendered under Alpha’s increasingly stern gaze and admitted his mistake, saying, “Fine, fine, I know, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have acted based on impulse!”

        However, the near-death experience did not dampen Beta’s competitive spirit. He continued to challenge himself and even pestered Schnauzer to practice with him. On a brighter note, Alpha finally got some quality sleep without his brother badgering him…</p>
