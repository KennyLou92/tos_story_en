        Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.5

        In the dungeon of the castle, Guinevere sat quietly in a corner, looking at the transom on the ceiling with her eyes filled with worries.

        'I wonder if Arthur and the others have escaped safely...'

        Bam! Bam! Two sounds of hard objects hitting the group came from the cell door, then brisk footsteps came closer-a man with a mushroom haircut came to Guinevere’s cell door, with the key chain spinning on his index finger. Smiling arrogantly, he said, 'Ha, the guards of the palace are no big deal.'

        'Gareth!' Guinevere let out a quiet scream, surprised.
        'We’ve come to your rescue.' Gareth tilted his chin triumphantly.

        Earlier, Gareth, Arthur and their friends were encircled by Mordred’s army at the temple.  In the end, Lancelot was brainwashed and Arthur was seriously injured while Guinevere disguised herself as Arthur with the help of Merlin’s magic and surrendered herself to Mordred so as to help the others defuse the crisis.

        Gareth and his companions survived. After they consolidated, they decided to sneak into the palace to stop Mordred’s evil deeds. Gareth was the one responsible for going to the dungeon to save the captured Guinevere.

        'How did you get in here? There are a lot of guards outside,' asked Guinevere.

        'Humph, how could those morons resist my hypnosis. Enough with that. Let me open the door and get you out of there.'

        Just as Gareth’s hand touched the cell, an ominous purple light flashed. He stepped back in fright and yelled in confusion, 'Wh- what happened?'

        'I can feel that the light just now contains magic power. Maybe you just triggered some kind of magic...'  After thinking for a while, Guinevere gave a start and yelled at Gareth nervously, 'they anticipated that you would come to save me, so they enchanted the cell with magic. I'm afraid the soldiers will be here soon. Run away now!'

         'No, we’re so close! How can I go by myself!' Gareth gritted his teeth, picked up the key and tried to unlock it. 'No, this isn’t it either! How come there are so many keys! I don’t think they have this many cells here.'

        He tried every key-'Why are they all wrong! Wait, could it be a trap in the first place!?'

        It was a pity that Gareth realized it too late. Meanwhile, footsteps came from outside the dungeon.
        'Leave me here. You just go! They’re coming! You can’t defeat them!'

        'No! I won’t leave you here alone, not even if I can’t beat them.' Gareth grabbed the long sword at a corner and stiffly held it in front of his chest.

        Just then, two soldiers wearing dark metal came. They raised their swords and slashed at Gareth mercilessly.

        'Noooo——! Don-don’t kill me!' Gareth’s courage dissipated as soon as he faced such fierce attacks. He dropped the sword flusteredly and dodged the attack by rolling on the ground. Then out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of the broken bricks and stones at the spot where he had been, and the iron branches of the side window that were all cut off——

        ‘Tha-tha-that’s terrifying. Their attacks can even break through the iron cell… Ah! I’ve got an idea!’

        A flash of wit hit upon Gareth. He walked to the iron fence and asked Guinevere to take a few steps back.  The dark metal armored soldier let out a purple stream and slashed brutally at Gareth. Yet, the latter dodged the attack easily as he caught the knight’s heavy footwork.

        Two strokes of heavy sword hit the iron fence and broke the cell! Under the flying dust, Gareth took Guinevere’s hand and ran out. Then he helped her climb onto the wooden table to the tattered side window.

        Just as the soldiers were going to chase after them, Gareth raised his eyebrow and threw the torch on the wall at them. The soldiers dodged it but the haystacks on the ground caught on fire. The fire spread and smoke filled the room.

        When the soldier realized, Gareth and Guinevere had already disappeared at the window...
