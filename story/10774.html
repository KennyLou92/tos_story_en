        <h1>Redefinition of Variables - Moriarty</h1>
        <p>
                In the kingdom of Verdilles, located in the western Tarones, a beautiful woman walked briskly to the immigration counter with her luggage at the airport. After she placed her passport on the desk, the officer picked it up and quickly verified the data. He then inquired with a professional smile, “Miss Moriarty, are you taking the flight to Rycaza today?”

        “Yes, that’s correct.”

        “And may I ask the purpose of your visit to Rycaza?”

        “I’m attending a mathematics conference,” Moriarty replied with a gentle smile that softened her rather cool appearance,  “I am a mathematics professor.”

        “Ah, I see.” After taking a glance at the passport, the officer returned it to Moriarty. With a genuine smile now tinged with respect, he said, “Have a safe trip.”

        “Thank you,” Moriarty responded with a nod. She then walked into the departure lounge, intending to find a seat near the boarding gate to rest before the flight departure. However, her steps suddenly paused as she caught a glimpse of a man dressed in all black sitting in a corner. The man, sensing her gaze, immediately pulled his hat down to hide his face.

        ‘It’s him… What a surprise,’ Intrigued by the man’s presence, Moriarty arched an eyebrow before redirecting her focus and taking a seat.

        Before long, the boarding announcement echoed through the lounge. With only a few passengers on board, the plane soon took off. Seated by the window, Moriarty watched as the plane ascended into the sky, flying over layers of clouds. However, a commotion broke out a few rows ahead of her as she was about to read a book to pass the time.

        “Miss! Miss! The seatbelt sign is still on. Please remain seated!” A flight attendant tried to reason with a female passenger who rose from her seat. Instead of following the flight attendant’s guidance, the woman suddenly grabbed the flight attendant, pressing a knife against her neck with an arm holding her shoulder.

        “Ah!” The flight attendant let out a cry of terror, causing fear to ripple through other passengers in the cabin.

        One brave male passenger mustered the courage to stand up and confront the woman, “St-stop what you’re doing and let her go!”

        “Heh, you think you can save her?” The woman let out a hysterical laugh. Blood began to trickle down the flight attendant’s neck as the woman’s knife cut her skin, forming a trace of crimson. “She is just the beginning. All of you non-believers who dare to insult our leader must die! No one can walk out here alive! Mwahahaha!”

        ‘Their leader…  So she is a black witch…’ It did not take long for Moriarty to figure out the deranged woman’s identity.

        Back in the Enoch era, a witch named Morgan le Fay appeared in the kingdom of Verdilles. She seduced the king’s little brother and gave birth to a boy. To snatch the throne for her son, she put a curse on the king and orchestrated his death. Fortunately, the king’s daughter, Arthur, managed to defeat her and reclaim her throne with the help of her loyal knights.

        Still, some of Morgan le Fay’s followers escaped the punishment. They continued to expand their coven by deceiving unsuspecting individuals and indoctrinating them in terrorism as a means to avenge their leader.

        Despite the kingdom’s relentless efforts to apprehend the terrorists and spread the truth, there were always some who believed in the false story and strayed onto the path of extremism, much like the woman before them.

        “You’re the one who is going to die!” A burly man roared angrily. He lunged toward the woman, attempting to subdue her by force, but he failed.

        Bang! A loud gunshot echoed through the cabin as a bullet precisely pierced through the man’s forehead, creating a charred hole. His robust frame crumpled to the ground, eliciting gasps from the passengers around.

        “Humph! Fool, did you really think I would hijack the plane without doing any preparations?” The woman sneered with a gun in her right hand. Holding the flight attendant hostage in her left arm, she glanced around the cabin and saw the looks of horror on the passengers’ faces. “I have no time to waste on small fries like you. Just stay in here.” 

        Receiving a forceful push from the woman, the flight attendant stumbled and fell forward. Then, the woman threw a diamond-shaped, iridescent crystal into the air, which produced a burst of blinding light, obscuring everyone’s vision in an instant. 
        When the radiance faded, everyone found themself in an unknown space shrouded in purple mist.

        “Wh-what in the world is happening?” a male passenger asked.

        “It’s a magical barrier,” Moriarty said.

        “I don’t care what it is, I just want to get out of here!” he screamed.

        “We mustn’t act rashly in this dangerous situation. Please stay calm—”

        “No! I don’t want to stay here any longer!” Despite Moriarty’s attempt at dissuasion, the man, overwhelmed by fear, ran straight into the purple mist. A terrified scream followed and lasted for a moment until it fell into silence. Everyone knew that the man’s fate was likely grim.

        “Boohoo… I… I don’t want to die…”
        “Th-this is too much… I just want to go home…”
        “Can… Can someone save us…”

        The seed of despair began to sprout in the heart of every passenger. Just as fear was about to crush their spirits, a clear voice, filled with strength and determination, cut through the despairing air,

        “Do not give up on hope, brave subjects of Verdilles.” The man clad in all black removed his hat, revealing a flowing mane of sleek hair and a masculine face with a rather waxen complexion. His eyes shimmered with the light of wisdom.

        “I-it’s Prince George!” The passengers exclaimed in surprise, all eyes focusing on the man as if he were a torch in the darkness.

        “You need not fear. In the name of Pendragon, I swear I will protect you.”

        “Thank goodness. With Prince George’s presence, the knights will surely come to our rescue!”
        “Yes, yes! I’ve heard that Prince George is remarkably intelligent, so much so that he is even smarter than the first prince.”
        “Prince George would be the next in line for the throne if it wasn’t for his health condition.”

        Prince George’s presence restored confidence and hope in the passengers’ hearts. With their gaze fixed on him, they eagerly asked, “Your Highness, what should we do now?”

        “To break free from this barrier, we must first locate its core and destroy it,” George, rubbing his chin, pondered for a moment. “Let’s split up and search within our visible range. If you find anything suspicious, do not touch it. Inform me so I can assess the situation.”

        “Yes, Your Highness!” Everyone responded with high spirits.

        Unfortunately, only disappointment awaited them. There was nothing in this artificial world that could be discerned as the barrier’s core.

        “Could the core be hidden beyond the mist?”

        “No, the core of the barrier must be hidden within it, or else it wouldn’t function,” Prince George shook his head.

        “But we’ve searched everywhere…”

        “No,” Moriarty refuted the passenger’s conclusion,  “There’s still one place we haven’t checked yet.”

        Moriarty looked toward a certain direction. George followed her gaze and immediately realized, “You’re right. We did miss a spot.”

        The passengers, perplexed by the two’s conversation, looked at each other in silence, until finally, one bold passenger asked, “Where is that exactly?”

        Instead of answering the question, Moriarty strode forward and approached the dead man’s body. However, a hand stopped her before she could touch it.

        “Please let me do it,” George smiled. Moriarty did not insist and took a step back.

        George, crouching beside the body, carefully cut open the wound on the man’s forehead. To spare the passengers the unsettling scene, he mindfully blocked their view with his body until he retrieved a bullet from the flesh.

        “Just as we thought,” George knew immediately that he had found the core.

        It was a diamond-shaped crystalline bullet that shimmered with iridescent light with enigmatic runes dancing on its surface.

        As beautiful as it was, George did not spend a second to admire it. With a swift and decisive swing of his sword, he split the bullet in half.

        Crack!

        As soon as the bullet shattered, a flash of white light enveloped everyone present. When their vision cleared, they found themselves back in the cabin.

        However, the woman was nowhere to be seen; evidently, she had made her way to the cockpit.

        While the passengers celebrated their safe return to the cabin, George and Moriarty exchanged a knowing glance and simultaneously headed toward the cockpit, but they seemed to be a step too late…

        The two pilots had died, fatally stabbed in the back before they could grasp the situation, their eyes wide open in a deathly stare.

        “So, you managed to escape...” the woman growled.

        “Yeah, and now you’re the one who’s trapped. Drop your weapon and surrender,” George stepped forward, positioning himself in front of Moriarty to protect her.

        “You…” The woman squinted. A manic grin spread across her face as she recognized George. “Oh my, look who we have here. It’s Prince George. How lucky I am to take you down with me.”

        “No, we won’t die. Your plan has failed,” Moriarty spoke coldly.

        “No, it hasn’t, because I can still kill you both!” the woman exclaimed while charging toward George, raising her knife to strike. However, someone intercepted her attack.

        It was Moriarty, who conjured a magical shield on her left hand to parry the woman’s attack. Following the successful defense, she swiftly drew intricate patterns in the air with her right hand. The patterns transformed into a glowing rope that bound the woman who was rather surprised by Moriarty’s identity than her attack.

        She looked at Moriarty and said through gritted teeth,  “You! You’re a witch too! Why are you siding with these sinners?”

        “Ha, that’s because I’m a clever witch, and you’re a fool,” Moriarty chuckled, “See, your plan has failed miserably.”

        “No…” the woman said, her lips curling into a smirk, “Not yet.”

        “No—” George, who noticed something amiss, stepped forward to stop the woman, only to see her clench her teeth—

        Boom!

        A deafening explosion reverberated outside the aircraft, followed by violent shaking that eventually subsided after a moment. Moriarty grabbed the woman’s collar, intending to interrogate her, only to find that she had already ended her life.

        “...She must have detonated the magic bomb she had set up in the fuel tank,” said George, who had walked to the control panel, observing the rapidly decreasing fuel levels.

        “It was my fault. If only I had noticed it earlier,” Moriarty said with regret as she set down the woman’s body. Yet, George shook his head, “No one could have anticipated the depths of her madness.”

        “You’re right,” Moriarty quickly composed herself and said, “Now is not the time to beat ourselves up. We must land the plane as soon as possible, or it will be our doomsday when the fuel runs out.”

        “I know how to pilot an aircraft. I can land the plane but I’m unsure about where to land it,” George said.

        “I can help you with that,” Moriarty said with a confident smile, “I am a mathematics professor. Calculation is my forte.”

        Following Moriarty’s instruction, George piloted the plane back to Verdilles. Fortunately, they had not flown far away from the kingdom and they managed to descend at the airport, narrowly stopping on the runway just eighty meters from the sea.

        It was not until the plane landed safely that the two’s pounding hearts finally slowed down. They exchanged a glance and a smile. It was clear that something had blossomed between them during the unexpected ordeal.

        “Thank you. I wouldn’t have landed the plane safely without you,” George said gently with a smile.

        “Well, then I should thank you as well. The plane would have crashed if you didn’t volunteer to fly it.”

        And this perilous adventure marked the beginning of the love story between two equally remarkable individuals…</p>
