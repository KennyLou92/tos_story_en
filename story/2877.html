        <h1>Chivalrous Kitten - Zero</h1>
        <p>        In the courtyard of a certain villa, the feline duo, Plumpy and Fist, engaged in a fierce combat, while Mellow, another petite feline, sat on a raised chair nearby, watching them.

        The three cats were all thieves under the great bandit named Ali Baba. Some days ago, their leader, Ali Baba, was abducted by his dreaded admirer, Blodgett. To rescue Ali Baba, Mellow and the other cat thieves infiltrated the mansion where Ali Baba was imprisoned. They encountered numerous dangers along the way and came perilously close to failure.

        To prevent such mishaps from happening again, Mellow requested that Ali Baba provide specialized training for each member of the gang. Ali Baba readily agreed and lifted the restrictions on the cats. He even created a headquarters in the city center for Mellow to train the gang.

        As the frontline fighters of the gang, Plumpy and Fist were having their training session—a one-hour intensive combat session that Mellow had arranged for them to enhance their reflexes and endurance.

        “Five minutes left,” Mellow announced.

        “Thank goodness! It’s finally coming to an end. I’m exhausted,” Plumpy exclaimed with excitement.  Her lethargic kicks intensified as she was energized by the thought of the training session nearing its conclusion. Catching Fist off guard, her fierce kick unintentionally sent him flying across the courtyard. The latter ultimately crashed onto a round table on the other side, causing a loud commotion and knocking over a box placed on the table.

        The glass tube inside the box was propelled into the air, tracing a parabolic arc as it fell on Zero, who was about to enter the courtyard—

        Splash! The vial shattered upon impact, and the contents, a bright red liquid, splashed all over Zero, giving him a horrifying look.

        Taken aback by the consecutive accidents, Plumpy and Fist momentarily froze. Fortunately, the quick-witted Mellow hurried over to Zero. Lifting her head, she asked, “Are you okay?”

        Zero responded with his usual gentle smile, “I’m fine. It’s just a glass tube… Huh?”

        Mid-sentence, Zero noticed that his voice had become increasingly soft and high-pitched, resembling that of an innocent young boy. In addition to that, his gaze lowered gradually until it was level with Mellow’s gaze.

        Zero looked up to Plumpy and Fist, who had come to his side and appeared giant-like, and hesitantly said, “You guys… look huge.”

        “No! It’s you who has turned small!” Mellow anxiously corrected him.

        Zero extended his hands in confusion, looking at his dainty, adorable hands. The revelation was so stupefying that even someone as carefree as Zero was struck motionless until a warm sensation suddenly enveloped him. 

        “Awwww! Little Zero is so adorable!” Plumpy exclaimed as she picked up the tiny Zero, rubbing her face against his tender cheek passionately.

        “Plumpy! Stop it!” Mellow reached out her paws to pull Plumpy away but lacked the strength. Thankfully, Fist quickly stepped in and lifted Plumpy from behind, freeing Zero from her clutches. As Zero recovered from the shock, he said, “It must be the potion in that glass tube—it has turned me small.”

        “Well, such a peculiar potion must be a creation of  Merbromin…” Mellow explained while observing Zero, her face contorting as if she was experiencing some kind of inner struggle. Eventually, unable to resist the urge, she gently stroked Zero’s hair and made a few extra strokes due to its temptingly soft texture.

        Zero was surprised but he quickly regained composure. Wearing a forgiving smile, he softly said, “If you want to touch my hair, just go ahead. I don’t mind.”

        “Cough. No, no need for that,” Mellow averted her face to conceal her embarrassment, then she continued, “Now we know Merbromin made the potion, let’s hurry and find her.”

        “But Merbromin isn’t here. She went to the city center to find some ingredients early in the morning,” Plumpy interjected as she had also calmed herself.

“We don’t know if that potion has any side effects, so let’s go to the city center and find her as soon as possible. Plumpy, Fist, you’re both coming too,” said Mellow.

        However, as soon as the group arrived at the city center, Plumpy was distracted by the delicacies on the street and forgot their original purpose. She dashed into the crowd, and Fist followed suit to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mellow and Zero, who were left behind, completely lost sight of their pals. Unable to push through the bustling crowd due to their diminutive physiques, the two could only huddle together on the side, anxiously waiting for their companions.

        “Plumpy that idiot! We shouldn’t have brought her along!” Mellow stomped her foot in frustration. Zero gently patted her shoulder to comfort her, “There’s no need to be angry. We’re not in a rush. Everything is going to be fine as long as we’re patient.”

        Unfortunately, their patience only brought a sleazy-looking man to them. The man cast a malicious gaze up and down at Mellow and then smirked, saying, “Oh my, look what adorable little kids we have here. What are you doing in such a boring place? Here, let me take you to somewhere fun.”

        “Tut!” Mellow could not help but roll her eyes. With crossed arms, she scolded the man dismissively, “Get lost! Stay away from us, you disgusting creep!”

        “You little brat! I was going to treat you gently, but your attitude has changed my mind!” The man angrily lunged at Mellow, but Zero stepped in front of her, swiftly delivering a sweeping kick that sent the man flying far away.

        “No one can hurt my pal!” Zero’s calm demeanor transformed into a blazing fury, ignited by his determination to protect his friend.

        Watching Zero, who remained sturdy and trustworthy despite his shrunk body, shielding her from harm, Mellow was deeply moved. Her eyes shimmered slightly, filled with warmth.

        ‘No matter how his appearance changes, Zero is always Zero, the unwavering man who would do anything to protect his pals.’

        Thanks to the commotion, Plumpy and Fist eventually found Mellow and Zero.

        Afterward, Fist and Plumpy—who overcame the temptation of food—took Mellow and Zero to Merbromin. As Merbromin helped to undo the potion effect with her profound knowledge, Zero regained his normal body, finally putting a happy end to the unexpected incident.</p>
