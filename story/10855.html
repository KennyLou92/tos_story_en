        <h1>Otto Suwen & Frufoo</h1>
        <p>
        Otto Suwen is a young man who is quick-witted yet lacks luck. He is blessed with the Divine Protection of the Soul of Language, which enables him to converse with any living creatures. He possesses considerable business acumen as a traveling merchant but incurably dogged by misfortune. His unlucky journey begins as he eagerly jumps into a lucrative opportunity he has overheard while travelling on the Lifaus Highway. After helping Subaru in the Sanctuary incident, he inadvertently becomes the internal affairs officer for Emiliaâ€™s party.

Frufoo is Otto's land dragon, a loyal companion who has accompanied him on many journeys since his childhood.</p>
