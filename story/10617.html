        <h1>Crystallic Resplendence - Nero</h1>
        <p>A Sacrapter who possesses the rarest spiral golden horn.
Reaching adulthood, she ventures to the realm of gods where she meets Prometheus, the Holy God. Deeply moved by Prometheusâ€™ gentle nature, she recognizes him as her master and embarks on a journey alongside him.

Her unswerving loyalty remains unswayed even when faced with the relentless invitations of Zeus, as she chooses to follow Prometheus, who eschews sycophancy.

While her demeanor often exudes a commanding presence, she has a rather stubborn personality and struggles to express her true feelings, especially her complex emotions toward Prometheus.</p>
