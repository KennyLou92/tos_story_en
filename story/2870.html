        <h1>Talismanic Twists - Lü Dongbin</h1>
        <p>
                Gao Yao and Lü Dongbin accidentally swapped bodies as they activated an amulet. It was after much hardship that Lü Dongbin, who was unable to speak with his soul trapped in Gao Yao’s body, managed to help Li Tieguai, his junior fellow apprentice, realize his true identity.

        And so, the two Xians were about to leave the residence and set out to find Gao Yao, whose soul now resided in Lü Dongbin’s body, but Li Tieguai suddenly halted in his tracks.

        “Brother Lü, do you feel like the ground is shaking?” he asked.

        “Woof! (Yes! I can feel it too! And it is getting stronger!)” Lü Dongbin replied with a bark.

        As Li Tieguai and Lü Dongbin exchanged a glance, a foreboding feeling arose within them simultaneously. They immediately rushed to the entrance, where they witnessed the cause of the shaking—a large group of enraged Xianss chasing after Lü Dongbin, who was frantically running on all fours.

        “Lü Dongbin! You’ve damaged my heavenly peach tree! You stop right there!” shouted one of the Xians.
        “Lü Dongbin! How dare you step on my head! I swear I’m going to get you today!” yelled another.
        “Lü Dongbin! How could you knock over my incense burner! I’ll eat my hat if I don’t kill you today!”

        Witnessing such a bizarre spectacle, Li Tieguai and the real Lü Dongbin were momentarily dumbfounded.

        “Woof woof woof! (That stupid dog! I can’t believe it has caused so much trouble and even crawled on all fours using my body! We must catch it as soon as possible, or my reputation will be tarnished!)” exclaimed Lü Dongbin within Gao Yao’s body.

        “Okay, Brother Lü! I’m good at running, so leave it to me!” Li Tieguai said confidently. He then hoisted Lü Dongbin on his back while channeling his Xian energy into his feet. With a forceful push, he vanished in the blink of an eye, leaving only a footprint-shaped pit on the solid ground.

        In a matter of moments, Li Tieguai had overtaken all the pursuing Xians and landed in front of Gou Yao, blocking its path.

        Desperate to reclaim his body, Lü Dongbin leaned out from Li Tieguai’s back and barked fervidly, “Woof woof woof! (Gao Yao! You stop right there!)”

        Startled by the familiar barking, Gao Yao turned around only to be terrified by the sight before it.

        “Wh-wh-why are there two of me?! It-it must be a demon trying to harm me! No, no!”

        Seeing its original body, Gao Yao, with the intelligence of a child, could not comprehend the situation. Overwhelmed by immense panic, its desperate desire to survive triggered the Xian energy within Lü Dongbin’s body and conjured a three-story-tall sword!

        “Oh no! People could die because of this!” Lü Dongbin felt a sense of self-blame as he anxiously watched the swording flying uncontrollably in the air. “I must find a way to stabilize the Xian energy within my body… Well, I guess I just have to give it a try!”

        “Ahhhhh—!” Gao Yao, overwhelmed by fear, let out a pitiful whimper. Its instinct drove it to use the giant sword to drive away all his pursuers.

        “Woof! (Stop it! You stupid dog!)” Lü Dongbin exerted all his strength and leaped from Li Tieguai’s back, successfully landing a hit on Gao Yao’s face.

        Although Gao Yao immediately struggled and shook its head, Lü Dongbin relentlessly clung to it like an octopus with his four limbs while concentrating his mind, trying to control the power within his original body.

        Boom! The wildly flying sword froze in place, as if held down by a giant hand, and plummeted into the ground, stirring up a cloud of dust and debris that obscured everyone’s vision.

        “Phew… Great! It turns out that I can still control the Xian energy within my body by physical contact, despite the absence of my soul… Wait! In that case, I can let Gao Yao go, or this stupid dog will go crazy again. Oh, for goodness’ sake, what should I do?” Lü Dongbin agonized.

        Just as Lü Dongbin was in distress, a figure descended from the sky and walked slowly toward him and Gou Yao.

        “What in the Heavenly Kingdom is happening, Lü Dongbin?” Taishang Laojun frowned slightly as he looked at the massive sword stuck in the ground.

        “Boo hoo...!” Upon seeing Taishang Laojun, Gao Yao walked over, rubbing its body against him regardless of Lü Dongbin, who was still clinging onto its face.

        “Lü Dongbin… What are you doing—” asked Taishang Laojun, who sensed something wrong as he observed the helpless expression and teary eyes of “Lü Dongbin”.

        Meanwhile, the cloud of dust slowly settled. Li Tieguai and the other Xians reopened their eyes, only to witness the sight of “Lü Dongbin” licking and rubbing against Taishang Laojun. A sudden silence fell over the place for a brief moment before an eruption of intense gossip.

        “I didn’t know that Lü Dongbin had such feelings toward Taishang Laojun…”
        “It-it’s beautiful! I knew handsome men belong to each other!”
        “But I thought Taishang Laojun was fond of that girl named Poppy… Is this the so-called love triangle?”

        Hearing the discussions veering into an absurd direction, Lü Dongbin finally snapped. He jumped off Gou Yao’s face and ran in front of the Xians, barking wildly.

        “Woof woof! (That’s Gao Yao, not me!)”

        Unfortunately, no one listened to Lü Dongbin, so he tugged at Li Tieguai’s robe forcefully. “Woof woof! (Li, tell them now!)”

        “Bro-brother Lü! Stop it! I know what to do!” After Li Tieguai neatened up his disheveled clothes, he shouted aloud, “Brother Lü and Gao Yao have switched bodies! It has been Gao Yao’s soul inside Brother’s body this whole time!”

        “I see.” Taishang Laojun looked at the real Gao Yao, who had wiped his tears and snot all over his clothes, and let out a sigh resignedly. “Oh well, what's done is done. Now come here, both of you. I’ll help you undo the spell.”

        Finally, with the help of Taishang Laojun, both Lü Dongbin and Gao Yao reclaimed their original bodies, bringing an end to the ridiculous farce.</p>
