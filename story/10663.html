        <h1>Mortal Atonement - Nuada</h1>
        <p>Galactic Odyssey - Ch.4

        <b><i>Day 579 of wandering—

        I’m elated.

        To abduct the former chief of the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research, I infiltrated a tourist spacecraft, where, to my surprise, I saw those two agents again. We were saved by another battleship. What a stroke of luck! It must be a sign from New Hampshire!

        This is a perfect opportunity, I must act with caution. I have to talk to the Guide of this battleship and join forces with them to eliminate those despicable agents, wiping out all those bastards who have put a bounty on us!

        I will avenge you, New Hampshire!
        Nuada</i></b>

        An ominous red light flashed in the quiet cabin in New Hampshire, the battleship. A female android tightly held a young boy, running through the corridors and heading straight for the parking dock. Regardless of the boy’s struggles, she forcefully shoved him into the cockpit of a small spaceship.

        “New Hampshire! Let me out, now!” shouted the boy, Nuada, the Guide of New Hampshire, the battleship. However, the female android did not heed his protests, focusing on securing him with the seat device.

        “No, Nuada. My self-destruct sequence has been forcibly activated. You’ll be blown into pieces if you stay here.”
　
        “Then let it be! I don’t care as long as I can be with you!”

        “No, Nuada. You have to live, survive, search for the most magnificent stars in the universe, and record them for me.”

        New Hampshire closed the spaceship’s door, gazing at Nuada through the window with a gentle smile. She looked at the boy who had been by her side for nearly a century, her intellectual core filled with a sense of sorrow and affection that was not written in her program. Like a mother, she dotingly admonished him, “Take good care of yourself, even though I won’t be around anymore. Remember to apply lubricant, or else your joints will get stuck again. And remember to watch out for your surroundings during stargazing…”

        New Hampshire remotely switched on the spaceship’s engine. The exit gate opened, revealing the vast and pitch-black space. The separation became inevitably real to Nuada at that moment. He desperately pounded on the window, trying to break it. Yet, the sturdy window remained sealed, just like his imminent fate.

        “New Hampshire! Please! Don’t leave me alone…” Nuada shouted, his voice choked with sobs. However, his plea could no longer reach New Hampshire’s ears.

        “My dear Guide, I wish you a safe and pleasant journey.” Standing on the parking dock, the android calmly watched as the small spaceship flew into space. A transparent and warm liquid trickled from the corners of her eyes.

        Although Nuada attempted to fly the spaceship back to the battleship, New Hampshire had already anticipated his actions—she activated the autopilot function which could only be switched to manual operation after the spaceship reached the specified distance.

        By the time Nuada regained control of the spaceship, a faint shockwave washed through the vehicle. He looked ahead only to witness a sight that would forever be etched in his memory— in the dark canvas of space, New Hampshire exploded, creating a brilliance even more dazzling than any new star they had ever seen. It was as if New Hampshire used her final moments to illuminate Nuada’s path.

        It was a breathtaking beautiful radiance, yet all Nuada could feel was malice and despair. A searing pain coursed through his body from his chest. His rage mixed with a sense of helplessness, transforming into an overwhelming urge that compelled him to let out a mournful cry, “New Hampshire!”

        With the scream, Nuada awakened from the agonizing memories. He frantically looked around to find himself inside a narrow warehouse.

        ‘It has been almost a year and a half since I lost New Hampshire…’ Nuada thought, his head hanging low.

        After New Hampshire’s self-destruction, Nuada piloted the spaceship to a remote star. Fueled by his resentment toward the agents who destroyed New Hampshire, Nuada continued to live, determined to seek vengeance. Still, the pursuit of him never ended. Agents had been sent to hunt him down.

        For the first half year of his journey, Nuada lived as a fugitive until he was saved by another battlecruiser, New Jersey, during a chase.

        New Jersey had been betrayed by its Guide and was nearly captured by agents of the Oroz Management Center. Fortunately, he successfully escaped the pursuit with his strength. He then began to seek out companions, to gather forces for a counterattack.

        However, his actions were limited without a Guide. Fortunately, he encountered Nuada, who had lost his battlecruiser. The two reached an agreement to join forces for their common goal. They recruited two more battlecruisers and their respective guides, forming a united front.

        With their forces expanded, New Jersey proposed launching an assault on a residential planet to showcase their powers. However, Nuada felt it was unreasonable to involve innocent civilians so he suggested they kidnapped a prominent member of the Heptara Unies to open a negotiation.

        As reluctant as New Jersey was, he was compelled to agree to the idea with the support of the other two guides. He agreed to try Nuada’s plan with the condition that they would go back to his plan if Nuada failed to abduct the target within the given deadline or if the outcome turned out to be unfavorable.

        After a thorough investigation, Nuada and the two other Guides managed to track down the chief of the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research who planned to travel around the universe aboard a tourist spacecraft after his imminent retirement. And so, Nuada sneaked into the warehouse of the tourist spacecraft, patiently waiting for the opportune moment to abduct the chief. However, exhaustion overcame him, and he fell into a deep sleep and experienced a vivid recollection of the past.

        Nevertheless, Nuada quickly regained his composure. He glanced at a small window that reflected the unchanging darkness of space.

        “Our operation will start when the spacecraft lands. There’s still time before it reaches the destination. Let me just do my daily training first— Woah!”

        Suddenly, the spacecraft jolted violently. It took a while for the shaking to subside, but it was then replaced by a dreadful sense of oppression. Nuada peered out the window and saw a pale, grayish body followed by a scalp-tingling screech as if something was pressing forcefully against the spacecraft’s hull.

        ‘It’s a high-class Midden! It’s trying to crush the spacecraft!’ As a battlecruiser Guide, Nuada immediately recognized the dangerous creatures that proliferated throughout the cosmos.

        He rushed out of the warehouse, hearing screams and cries echoing throughout the spacecraft. As he made his way toward the control room, a powerful tremor stopped him in his tracks. But the disturbance quickly ceased, along with the screeching sound from outside the hull. Nuada looked through a window in the corridor only to find that the grayish body around the spacecraft had gone.

        ‘Someone blasted away the Midden!’ Just as Nuada wondered who could have done it, a figure that had been haunting him appeared at the tourist spacecraft’s entrance—a female machina in the Oroz Management Center uniform.

        ‘It’s her! That despicable machina! It was she who hacked into New Hampshire‘s system and activated the self-destruct sequence!’ Nuada quickly hid in the shadows to avoid detection. Luckily, the female machina did not notice him due to the critical situation.

        ‘Why is she here on the tourist spacecraft? Could she be the one who fought the Midden? No, if it was her, she couldn’t have boarded the spacecraft alone. Could it be the male machina who acted alongside her last time…’ Nuada’s thoughts raced.

        He soon arrived at a conclusion, which filled him with fervent excitement. His smile grew wider, tinged with madness and a thirst for revenge. ‘Perfect! Now I can wipe them all out and avenge New Hampshire!’

        To grasp the rare opportunity, Nuada suppressed his excitement and carefully tracked the female machina, patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

        Soon enough, another battlecruiser, Montana, along with his Guide, Scáthach, arrived and eliminated the Midden. They provided aid to the damaged tourist spacecraft and transferred all the passengers to Montana.

        Nuada knew that the female machina would find a way to take down Montana and Scáthach, so he remained hidden, biding his time until the opportune moment.

        As expected, the female machina used the passengers from the tourist spacecraft as leverage against Scáthach, regardless of the male machina’s opposition.

        Nuada quietly watched until the female machina and the male machina started a heated argument, oblivious to their surroundings. It was then that he made his move, gathering the elements and shooting an elemental arrow straight through the female machina’s kinetic core.

        “Laura!” Kepler, the male machina, rushed to catch the falling Laura, but her kinetic core was irreparably damaged, beyond any hope of repair.

        “Heh, that took her quick. Lucky for her,” sneered Nuada, walking toward Kepler and looking down at the barely breathing Laura with a disdainful gaze.

        “Nuada! You’ve violated the rules. I, Johannes Kepler, hereby announce that you’re under arrest! Drop all your weapons now!”

        “Tut!” Nuada scoffed, “Now you’re talking about rules. Back then, New Hampshire and I did nothing wrong, and still, you pursued us relentlessly.”

        “Laura did violate the protocols that day. We had no intention of activating the self-destruct sequence,” Kepler explained.

        “What’s the point now? You DESTROY New Hampshire! That’s the only truth! And now I will make you pay for it!” Without wasting another second, Nuada channeled his powers to unleash a fierce attack against Kepler.

        At first, Kepler still managed to put up a fight, but the injuries he sustained during the battle with the Midden had taken their toll. His movements grew slower and slower until he finally collapsed on the ground.

        Showing no mercy, Nuada stood before Kepler, raising his weapon to deliver the final blow—

        Unexpectedly, a powerful spinning kick knocked Nuada’s weapon out of his hand, and a young girl stood in front of the fallen Kepler. It was Scáthach, the Guide of the battleship.

        Previously, Laura had disrupted the signals of the incineration chamber, preventing Montana from entering the room with his android. Yet, the signal disruption was soon lifted as Nuada destroyed Laura’s core, allowing Montana to access the chamber and rescue Scáthach, who had been pinned to the wall by Laura’s restraining device.

        Nuada, who would have never imagined that Scáthach, upon regaining her freedom, would be the first to stand in his way, questioned in disbelief, “What are you doing? He’s the bastard who tries to apprehend us!”

        “But he just helped me, so I don’t think he’s a bad person!” Scáthach disagreed.

        “You idiot! Even if he helped you, so what? In the end, he came here to arrest you!”

        “Bu-but even so, we can’t just kill him for no reason!”

        “Tut” Nuada impatiently smacked his lips as he looked at Scáthach’s hesitant expression, and he said, “Anyway, I have to kill him to avenge New Hampshire. If you insist on standing in my way, then I’ll take you down first!”

        Nuada picked up his weapon, brimming with murderous intent as he lunged towards Scáthach. However, a male android grabbed him before he could reach her. It was Montana’s android.

        “Let go of me! You two fools! You’re being pursued for some unjust reasons, and yet you just stand there without a thought to resist when you have the power to fight! If I were you, I would fight back and wipe out those bastards who claim us to be wanted fugitives—”

        “That will only break her heart,” Montana suddenly spoke.

        “Who are you talking about? Stop talking nonsense! Just kill me, if you have the guts!” Nuada shouted loudly, the look on his face bordering on the deranged.

        Montana shook his head. He extended a hand toward Nuada’s neck to take out his necklace.

        Nuada’s expression immediately changed drastically because the pendant on that necklace was the last remains of New Hampshire. “Give it back! You bastard— New... New Hampshire!”

        “Nuada, it’s been a long time,” a female android suddenly appeared before Nuada. She called his name gently just like the way she had always done, causing an enormous wave of emotions to sweep through him, oblivious to the fact that Montana had released his grip.

        “Yo-you’re back?” Nuada asked with hopeful anticipation. Yet, his hopes were soon shattered as  New Hampshire shook her head. She explained, “No, I’m just reappearing using Montana’s core system, but the effect probably won’t last long.”

        “No… How can this be?!” Nuada was once again gripped by disappointment which only further fueled his resentful anger. He glared at Kepler and vowed, “It’s okay, New Hampshire. There’s only one murderer left, and I will avenge your death with my own hands!”

        However, Nuada’s vow did not seem to please New Hampshire. Instead, she looked at Nuada with a sorrowful gaze and shook her head, and she sighed, “Nuada, you’ve got it all wrong. I never wanted you to avenge me.”

        “What?” Nuada’s face, consumed by hatred, now showed a bewildered expression. He asked in confusion, “Then what do you want me to do?”

        “All I’ve ever wanted is for you to live a free life, one that is free from missions and hatred.”

        “But—” Nuada clenched his teeth and tightened his fists. He said with a resentful tone, “But I can’t!”

        “So you just let yourself wallow in hatred and do things that serve no purpose?”

        “I… I…” As much as Nuada wanted to deny New Hampshire’s question, he could not find the words. Deep down, he knew that killing Laura and Kepler would not change the fact that New Hampshire was long gone. He understood that his actions would only lead him to a point of no return. However, the overwhelming resentment and rage in his heart prevented him from reasoning logically, so he let his emotions take the reins.

        In the past, whenever Nuada found himself in such a situation, New Hampshire would guide him back onto the right path, just like she was doing now.

        New Hampshire questioned coldly, “Guide Nuada, do you truly believe that what you’re doing now will solve the problem? Do you think it will lead to the best possible outcome?”

        “...No,” Nuada took a deep breath, forcing himself to think objectively and analyze the situation. He lifted his head to look at New Hampshire and said, “It will only reinforce everyone’s belief that we, the battlecruisers and Guides, are true fugitive criminals who deserve to be destroyed.”

        “Exactly,” New Hampshire smiled with relief. “Instead of taking lives as people have perceived us, you should prove their fears wrong through your actions, just like Montana and Scáthach did.”

        “But…” Nuada looked at Laura lying on the floor. Her core was already on the verge of extinguishing, just one step away from death. “I can’t undo what I did.”

        “No, there’s still a chance,” New Hampshire smiled at Nuada as she always did. Then, her body gradually dissipated into the air, turning into shimmering specks of light that flew into Laura’s damaged core. The broken parts began to repair with elements reassembled within Laura’s body.

        “Nuada, goodbye.”

        “New Hampshire!” Nuada reached for New Hampshire, trying to grasp the presence he cherished the most. Yet, all he could grab was air. A feeling of hollow emptiness washed over him but her gentle words saved him.

        “Don’t lose yourself to hatred and despair. Don’t let the past hold your footsteps. I know your future will shine as bright as the stars, and I shall watch you from the Abyss.” New Hampshire’s voice gently brushed against Nuada’s ear, guiding him out of the void.

        “...New Hampshire, I won’t let you down again.” Although Nuada was still stricken with grief and despair, New Hampshire gave him enough courage to face the future. He would not run away anymore, nor would he let anger consume him.

        “I will fulfill your wishes, and clear the name of all battlecruisers and Guides!”
