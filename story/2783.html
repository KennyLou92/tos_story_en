        <h1>Brynhildr the Scythe of Survival</h1>
        <p>
                Brynhildr was weary of the repeated battles in the Tower. In response to her overtired soul, the elements indulged her with an illusion…

        For the sake of the North, King Budli forwent his claim to his kingdom, making it a line of defense against the demons so that his people could live under the protection of Aesir and the North Alliance.

        ‘But… why us?!’ asked Brynhildr in an anguished voice.

        ‘Because it has to be us,’ Budli answered after a moment of silence.

        ‘But——’

        ‘Enough.’ Budli stood up abruptly. Smoldering resentment and agony flickered across his face, but he soon suppressed those emotions and said, ‘Brynhildr, we must give up our kingdom to survive, so that we can have a future.’

        Seeing her father’s red-rimmed eyes, Brynhildr could not blame him. She knew it would be best for her to leave obediently so her father could retain his pride. However, the churning emotions in her heart froze her legs.

        “Father is right. We need the North Alliance in order for everyone to survive. BUT, there is something more important than our lives, something we can never give up!”
　
        Biting her lips, Brynhildr made up her mind and unsheathed the long sword on her waist.

        ‘Brynhildr! What are you doing?! Put down your sword!’ screamed Budli, trying to halt Brynhildr. The latter did not listen but shook her head.

        ‘Father, I know you. You will definitely stay on the battlefield till the very last moment because running away is never an option for you.’

        ‘...This is not a decision I made alone.’

        ‘No, but you know exactly what will happen if you abandon your homeland—your soul and the ones of our people will die bit by bit. Losing their homes, our people will only end up being enslaved and living in lifelong torment!’

        Budli did not respond, but the swirling grief in his eyes still revealed his true desire.

        ‘Father.’ Brynhildr swung her sword and cut her long hair off her back. She then looked right into her father’s eyes with great valor and determination, and said, ‘I would like to volunteer myself to the battlefield and fight alongside our people to defend our homeland to the end! I am sure that our people will make the same choice as I do. They are no cowards; they sure will not desert their homes to spend the rest of their lives in disgrace!’

        Budli was already wavering and Brynhildr’s words gave him a push to follow his heart. In the end, with his people’s support, he decided to call off the deal with the North Alliance and defend his kingdom.

        However, his kingdom kept losing ground to the powerful demon army, and eventually, the demons pushed into the imperial city. Under the crossing blades of soldiers and demons, the land was soaked in crimson. Amid the deafening screams of slaughter, the military base where Brynhildr and Budli were was besieged by the demon army.

        Swamped by the enemies, the guards all fell, one by one. With King Budli sacrificing himself for his daughter, Brynhildr was left alone in a despairing situation.

        She drew her sword to take down one demon after another until she used up all her strength. Just when she was about to stab herself to end her own life, someone knocked down her sword to the ground. Brynhildr looked back in despair, only to find a young swordsman…

        Riding a horse, Sigurd broke into the demons’ siege alone to save Brynhildr.

        ‘Your Highness, you are safe now.’ Sigurd’s gentle words flowed into Brynhildr’s heart, dispelling her loneliness with a touch of warmth.

        After Sigurd got off the horse and lifted Brynhildr to let her sit on it, he saddled up again and immediately rode away before the demons rushed to attack them.

        Along the way, Brynhildr felt unprecedentedly safe as she put her arms around Sigurd’s sturdy body and listened to his heartbeat. With her stretched nerves being finally relaxed, she could not help but fall asleep.

        When Brynhildr woke up, she had been escorted back to the imperial cityby Sigurd. After that, she promptly called upon the remaining soldiers to guard the city.

        In the days of defending the city together, Brynhildr and Sigurd fell in love with each other and even had a simple wedding. 

        Gazing at Sigurd before the altar, Brynhildr recalled the prophecy Mimir the sage had given her.

        “Princess of the North, please remember that bravery will be at the heart of your husband’s life.  Under the sun, there is no man nobler than him.”

        “You were right. My husband is indeed the bravest and noblest warrior in the world,” Brynhildr thought with a smile, then she kissed Sigurd.

        Soon after their wedding ended, Sigurd put on his armor to banish the invading demons while Brynhildr earnestly issued commands to transport supplies to the frontline.

        Still, their efforts were all in vain before the ceaseless army of demons—the city finally fell.

        ‘It’s time,’ whispered Brynhildr, looking at the flying sparks in the distance.

        ‘Yes, and everyone is ready.’ Reaching out his hand, Sigurd stroked Brynhildr’s cheek and gently wiped the blood from her forehead. Then he said in a soft voice, ‘I will be with you till the very end.’ 

        ‘So do I.’  The two smiled at each other. Without saying another word, they joined hands and headed to the battlefield. Brynhildr and Sigurd did not stop wielding their swords at the demons until the last moments of their lives…

        “Perhaps I have been too vain and obsessed with glory—life shall be the cornerstone of soul.”</p>
