        She was born in the second vampire family, Karnstein. She has a son named Napoleon with Carlo Bonaparte, who is the ruler of the first vampire family.
Apathetic by nature, she puts her own interests before anything else. She makes an agreement with Carlo to bear a child who will be his successor so as to balance the power struggle between the first and second vampire families.
