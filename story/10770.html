        <h1>Arithmetic of Truths - Holmes</h1>
        <p>
                As a high-speed train pulled into the capital of the Kingdom of Verdilles, a batch of weary passengers hurriedly rose to their feet to gather their belongings in preparation for disembarkation. Yet, a girl stood out amidst the hustling throng in the narrow carriage. She calmly waited until all the passengers had left the train before picking up her luggage and walking through the doors.

        “What a lovely weather it is today,” the girl, Sherlock Holmes, remarked as she gazed at the azure sky with a smile of contentment. However, her pleasant mood was soon ruined by a distant shout coming from the platform.

        “You filthy peasant! Stay away from me!” a middle-aged nobleman bellowed as he roughly shoved aside a frail and diminutive elderly woman. Just as the woman was about to topple over by the man’s push, someone held her from behind.

        “Madam, are you alright?” Holmes inquired with concern as she caught the old lady just in time.

        “I’m fine, thank you,” the elderly woman gratefully replied.

        Feeling relieved, Holmes turned her gaze toward the nobleman and scorned, “It’s astonishing to see how uncivilized the citizens of Verdilles have become since my last visit just a few years ago, a supposed gentleman bullying an elder in public.”

        Holmes’ sharp and icy glare sent a shiver down the nobleman’s spine. However, he quickly shook off the fear and defended himself, “I-I didn’t do it on purpose. I only did it because she came out of nowhere and shoved something dirty toward my face.”

        “It’s not dirty! It’s a photo of my granddaughter…” The elderly woman unfolded the photo in her hand, a photo of a beautiful girl with a bright smile, “She didn’t come home last night, and I’ve been worried. That’s why I’ve been asking around if anyone has seen her…”

        “A missing girl? You might as well give up now, old woman,” the man said with a gloating tone, “Your granddaughter must have been kidnapped by the Headhunter, possibly dead by now.”

        “The Headhunter?” Holmes murmured in surprise, “Wasn’t he arrested and executed six years ago? How could he be responsible?”

        “You don’t know?” the nobleman sized up Holmes and then said knowingly, “You must be new in Verdilles. Two girls’s bodies were found headless several days after they had gone missing last week. It is said that it was a gruesome act by some copycat of the infamous serial killer, the Headhunter…” the nobleman said, “But, that’s none of my concern because I have a business meeting to attend!”

        The nobleman hurriedly turned to leave. Strangely, he felt a sudden chill above his head when he brushed past Holmes. He reached for his head only to touch his exposed bald scalp, and he screamed, “M-my wig! Where is it?”

        “Well, this look is more fitting for you, is it not?” Holmes smirked mischievously. The man, with his ire evaporated by the dire threat behind her smile, fled while covering his bald head in embarrassment.

        “Grandma!” a clear voice called out from the other end of the platform as a tall man ran toward the elderly woman.

        “Hans!” The elderly woman, upon seeing the young man, immediately grabbed his arm anxiously and asked, “Have you found your sister?”

        Hans’ face darkened as he slowly shook his head. Putting his arm around the elderly woman whose look of excitement had waned, he tried to comfort her and said, “Don’t worry. Sister will come home. You should go back and rest now, given your health condition.”

        “No! I must find Lillie and bring her back!” As the elderly woman insisted, Hans could only relent and continued the search with her.

        “Then let me help you,” Holmes interjected.

        “Who are you?” Hans scrutinized Holmes warily.

        “Sherlock Holmes. I’m a detective, someone you may find helpful,” Holmes introduced herself. 

        “But wouldn’t it be too much trouble for you?” the elderly woman hesitantly asked.

        “Not at all,” Holmes smiled, “It’s a detective’s job to solve mysteries after all.”

        And so, Holmes, along with Hans and the elderly woman, asked around for Lillie’s whereabouts. They managed to find some clues, but still, they could not figure out the location. Time passed swiftly and dusk began to fall. Seeing the elderly woman’s stamina ebbing away, Hans could no longer suppress his concern and eventually decided, “We mustn’t continue the search! You’ll tire yourself out.”

        “But Lillie is scared of being alone…”

        “We don’t know if she’s alone!” Hans shouted, his voice carrying a hint of weariness, “Let’s call it a day and head home.”

        “Indeed, the elderly’s health is of the utmost importance. Please leave the rest to me,” Holmes thumped on her chest, “I will find your granddaughter.”

        “...Very well then,” the elderly woman finally agreed and returned home with her grandson, leaving Holmes alone in the quiet depths of the night.

        “Alright, let me get back to work.” Holmes continued the investigation alone and ultimately narrowed it down to an abandoned factory in the area where the girl was last seen.

        It seemed to be nothing more than a large deserted factory at first glance. Yet, Holmes was well aware that sometimes the truth hides in plain sight.

        “Found it.” As Holmes speculated, she discovered a manhole concealed by overgrown vegetation as well as the ruts nearby. Yet, the discovery did not bring Holmes joy as those marks likely indicated Lillie had met a tragic fate.

        ‘I must find her, whether dead or alive.’ Holmes lifted the manhole cover and descended the ladder. A strong whiff of blood reached her nose before she could reach the bottom, which confirmed her speculations.

        At the end of the underground sewer, she saw a headless girl’s body lying sprawled in a pool of blood. There was a grotesque sense of beauty that revealed the murderer’s obsession with death.

        The gory sight left Holmes speechless for a moment before she took another step, intending to examine the corpse. Just then, she heard a loud echo—someone was in the underground sewer!

        “Freeze!” a commanding shout echoed through the underground sewer as a bright light fell on Holmes. It was a young man, holding a powerful flashlight in one hand while aiming a gun at Holmes with the other. He sternly shouted, “I’m a police officer. Miss, I now suspect you’re involved in the recent serial murder cases. Please come with me back to the police station for interrogation!”

        “...Huh?”

        Although Holmes could have refused to cooperate,  she surrendered and let the officer take her back to the police station for interrogation after considering the trouble that would ensue.

        “Tell me! Why did you murder those girls?” The officer thumped the table with his fist, questioning Holmes loudly.

        “I didn’t murder them. My answer remains the same no matter how many times you ask,” Holmes repeated her answer wearily for the eighteenth time.

        “Then why were you—”

        “I was hired to find a woman’s granddaughter and I managed to find her body based on the clues I had gathered. I was about to report it to the police when you arrived,” Holmes explained before the officer could finish his question, leaving him stunned for a moment.

        Yet, the officer soon collected himself and continued, “So you’re telling me that it’s just coincidence? Stop lying!”

        “It is indeed just a coincidence. Besides, I have an alibi. I arrived in the kingdom just yesterday, so I couldn’t have been the killer in the previous two cases, and by the same logic, I couldn’t have murdered the girl in this case.”

        “How is it impossible?” The officer sneered. “You’re an Akashic, right? Gods knowledgeable in magic and such. As far as I know, you could have teleported yourself with magic!”

        “...Well, Officer, magic isn’t perfect; it has limitations. Long-distance teleportation requires massive magical apparatus; it can’t be done with just a snap of the fingers,” Holmes sighed in exasperation. “Besides, if we follow your line of reasoning, anyone with magical knowledge could be a suspect.”

        “Indeed, but you were the only one who remained unmoved before that gruesome corpse!” The officer clenched his fist and shouted imperiously, “I will never let a despicable criminal like you get off the hook!”

        ‘This is a torture. That’s why I have always detested fools, especially quick-tempered fools. Can… Can someone please come and get me out of here?’ Holmes pressed her throbbing temples in frustration.

        Knock! Knock! The officer opened the door only to see his subordinate, who reported, “Sir, a man is here to bail out the suspect.”

        “Who is it?” The officer asked, looking displeased.

        “It’s me,” the man, Watson, replied as he entered the interrogation room. He presented a pardon to the officer and said, “This is an official pardon freshly issued by Prince Frederick Pendragon, the deputy representative of humans and the fifth prince of Verdilles. It is stated that the suspect, Sherlock Holmes, is allowed to participate in the investigation of the Headhunter imposter case.”

        “WHAT?” The officer exclaimed in disbelief as he snatched the pardon from Watson’s hand. “It’s the actual signature of Prince Frederick… Who are you exactly to have the Prince vouch for you?”

        “I’m nothing more than a detective,” Holmes brushed her sleeves before motioning to Watson with her chin, “Watson, let’s go to the morgue.”

        “I’m going with you!” Despite the pardon, the officer insisted on following them, refusing to let Holmes out of his sight.

        “I heard that the officer’s father died in the line of duty during the Headhunter investigation, and he has been chasing after every detail related to the case since then,” Watson whispered to Holmes as they walked ahead, sharing the information he had gathered.

        “Watson, do not let some gossip cloud your judgment. We must stay objective. What’s important is to solve the case,” Holmes said, quickening her pace toward the bed where the headless body lay in the morgue.

        “The victim died from hypovolemic shock, caused by loss of blood. The clean and precise cuts suggest the murder weapon could be a cleaver. The killer must have done it multiple times… Hey, are you even listening?” While Watson shared the result of his examination, Holmes lifted the white sheet covering the body instead of listening to him.

        “Shh!” Holmes shushed Watson, putting a finger to her lips. It was after a moment of quiet observation that a look of realization crossed her face as she murmured, “I see… The truth always manages to surprise me.”

        “Huh? Have you figured out the murderer already?”

        “I have a rough idea, but I need evidence to prove it,” Holmes said, raising her staff and gently shaking it, “Jumping to conclusions without evidence only leads to chaos.”

        “How do we prove it then?” Watson asked.

        “By returning to the crime scene, of course. Let’s go, Watson.”

        And so, Watson and the officer followed Holmes to the crime scene—the deserted factory where the body had been found. To their surprise, someone seemed one step ahead of them.

        “Ugh… What are you doing here?” said the middle-aged nobleman whose barren scalp had been exposed by Holmes the other day, with a look of disdain.

        “I might as well ask you the same question,” Holmes replied.

        “Tut! I’m here for business, of course,” the man clicked his tongue. “I had made a deal to sell this factory. I was just a step away from signing the contract, and yet, the police found a body here last night and ruined everything!”

        “Ha, that’s certainly uplifting news,” Hans, the victim’s brother, sneered. He then turned to Holmes and explained, “Grandma found out about what happened to Lillie. She was devastated and cried herself to sleep this morning. That’s why I came here alone to say one last goodbye to my sister.”

        “...Both of them seem suspicious,” Watson whispered to Holmes.

        “I’ve told you before: never make judgments based on assumption. Now go down and get me some useful evidence,” Holmes said as she lifted her leg and mercilessly kicked Watson into the manhole.

        “Woah!” Watson cried out in surprise at the sudden fall. Yet, he quickly adjusted his posture in mid-air and landed safely in the underground sewer.

        “Holmes, do you know how dangerous it was? Someone could have died from that fall if it wasn’t me,” Watson

        “Exactly, that’s why I did it, knowing you’d be fine. Thanks to you, I am now certain that my suspicion is correct,” Holmes said.

        She then turned to the man who followed them, pointing her staff at him as she made a bold declaration, “It was you who murdered the three girls, Lex. Or should I call you by your notorious name, Headhunter?”

        “WHAT?” Watson exclaimed, “But wasn’t the Headhunter already executed?”

        “Oh, Watson, to solve a mystery, one must eliminate the impossible. Whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth,” Holmes said. “I’ve looked at all three victims’ bodies in the morgue. They all have the same mark on their collarbones, the same mark the Headhunter left on his victims in his previous crimes. It is a detail that has not been disclosed to the public, thus proving it is not the work of a copycat killer.”

        “Am I right, Officer?” said Holmes with a smile.

        “...While the public may not know about the mark, those involved in the Headhunter case do, which includes you, Sherlock Holmes, the genius detective who solved the case at the tender age of ten,” the officer remarked in a maliciously cryptic tone that contrasted his righteous demeanor.

        “Indeed. However, do you mind explaining why you were here, in the underground sewer last night? This secluded factory, obviously, is not a place for routine patrols,” Holmes inquired.

        “Well, I’ve reported the reason. I came here to investigate the noises and stench after receiving a complaint,” the officer defended himself.

        “That’s quite an impressive web of lies,” Holmes applauded, “I didn’t hear a sound when I kicked Watson into the manhole, neither did I smell any stench. There was never a complaint; it was all a show staged by you.”

        “...Hahaha. Oh my, I never thought I’d fail because of the same girl twice,” the officer’s demeanor completely shifted, taking on a sinister twist, “Luckily, I have a hostage this time.”

        The officer drew his sidearm and pressed it against his chin, “I tricked this man into signing a familial contract with me years ago, allowing myself to possess his body after my execution. It wasn’t easy, of course; I couldn’t kill for years… But this man is clueless. He doesn’t even know I exist. So, if you kill me, you kill an innocent young man. Can you do it?”

        “Only fools feel the need to choose; the wise get everything with their wit,” Holmes said as she raised her staff, infusing it with magic until it glowed with blinding brilliance that enveloped her like countless stars.

        In that moment, Holmes’ consciousness transcended time and dimensions. She arrived at the Bibliotheca of Truth, a library that existed between space and time. Pushing open the majestic gates, she stepped into the mysterious and ethereal hall where numerous scrolls and books floated in mid-air, circling her.

        She grabbed one of the books, one that brimmed with a purplish glow—a grimoire of magical contracts. The knowledge within the grimoire flushed into her mind as she touched it.

        “Found it! The spell to break the familial contract!” Soon after Holmes’ consciousness returned to reality, she raised her staff once more. Enigmatic runes materialized in the air, transforming into a powerful beam of light that shot through the officer…

        “AHHHHH!” The light forced the Headhunter’s spirit out of the officer’s body. Yet, he remained relentless, attempting to escape.

        “Watson!” Holmes shouted.

        “I’m on it!” Watson answered as he leaped forward before Holmes’ command. In a few extraordinary moves, he grasped the fleeing spirit, shattering the killer’s last hope of escape.

        Afterward, Holmes and Watson handed the Headhunter’s spirit to the Verdilles police. With the praise and recognition they garnered, they were invited by the King to embark on a quest for the holy grail along with other renowned detectives…</p>
