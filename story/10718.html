        <h1>Guilt-ridden Eclosion - Evander</h1>
        <p>
        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 1

        The crescent moon hung high in the sky, casting a gentle glow over a dense forest. It would have been a serene and beautiful sight if not for the trail of devastation snaking through the trees: a mess of overturned soil, destroyed flowers, and animal carcasses.

        A large group of injured butterfly elves sought respite within the ravaged forest; the less injured tended to the more severely wounded. By a fallen tree sat a gravely injured male butterfly elf: his magnificent wings were tattered, and near his shoulder blade was a deep wound, bone exposed in the depths. A steady stream of blood trickled down from his lacerated flesh.

        The gory sight made the female butterfly elf attending to his wound choked with tears. With a voice filled with resentment and anger, she murmured, “Why… Why must we suffer at the hands of those despicable beasts? All of us… All of us would have been killed if that gladiospina hadn’t saved us! ”

        “The phantocaudas have always been known for their viciousness. It was just our luck bumping into them,” replied the injured male butterfly elf, Evander, whose ‘calm’ demeanor masked his worry. Despite knowing his friends and family had been captured by the phantocaudas, his duty as the leader of the butterfly elves demanded that he suppress his anxiety and make the most rational decision. “So instead of grumbling about what happened, we should be thinking of a plan to rescue our kin from those barbaric beasts,” he said.

        “But those beasts are so strong. We have no chance of defeating them on our own!” The female butterfly elf exclaimed, followed by a beat of hesitation before she continued, “Perhaps we should go to the gladiospinas’ abode and ask for their help.”

        “That would be a waste of time. We can’t rely on—”

        “Chief Evander!”

        A distant shout abruptly interrupted Evander’s rebuttal as a young butterfly elf swiftly flew towards them, landing in front of Evander with a magnificent gift box in his hands. However, despite the beauty of the box, the young elf’s body trembled uncontrollably as if he had just seen something terrible.

        “What is it?” asked Evander with concern.  Disregarding his own wounds, he rushed to support the trembling elf.

        “I… I found this box on the plain while patrolling just now. I thought it was one of those beasts’ traps, but nothing suspicious happened when I touched it… so I opened it, and then I f-found… ” The young butterfly elf stopped, his face paling into an awful color. 

        Unable to control his curiosity, Evander grabbed the box and opened it. His pupils contracted sharply the moment he witnessed the content inside. His hands trembled violently as he picked up the morbidly bloodstained wings, obviously uprooted from their owner, with that familiar pattern of ethereal, evening-sky huest. They belonged on the back of his beloved wife who had been seized by the phantocaudas. Yet, now her wings laid in his hands, fragile and forlorn.

        Evander’s chest tightened. His breath became heavy and loud; his body convulsed uncontrollably as if his wife’s agony was now being pressed onto him. 

        The elf beside him could not help but speak, “Evander…”

        “...I’m okay,” said Evander, reminding himself of his duty. He straightened his posture and gently placed his wife’s wings aside, trying to supress the inconsolable grief pounding against his heart. He picked up the second item in the box, a bloodstained letter, and skimmed through it. His grip tightened before he could finish reading it, his face tainted with fury.

        “Evander, what does the letter say?” the elf asked anxiously.

        “The phantocaudas say they will release our kin if we take that gladiospina to them,” answered the young butterfly elf who had delivered the box. His voice was nervous, but there was a strange undertone of excitement as he continued, “It says they will let us live if we do as they say.”

        “That’s ridiculous!” Evander furiously hit the tree trunk behind him and said, “That gladiospina…Mistilteinn… She saved our lives. How could we repay her kindness with betrayal?” 

        “What does it matter?” said the female butterfly elf, her calm reaction juxtaposing the enraged Evander. Her eyes filled with astonishment as she looked at him and said, “How could we compare a gladiospina, a total stranger, to the lives of our family, our loved ones? If sacrificing her will save our people, well, it is only natural for us to betray her.”

        “No… We can’t do that to her—”

        “Evander, if you won’t do it, we will!”  Suddenly, a dozen butterfly elves emerged, their gazes pinned on Evander. The one standing in the front raised his head with determination, declaring, “I will do anything to get our people back, even if it means doing something disgraceful and condemnable!”


        “You guys…” Evander looked at his fellow elves whose eyes brimmed with unwavering resolve that began to shake his convictions, casting a shadow of doubt.

        “Evander, think about your wife. Now we have a chance to save her. Are you really going to give up on her just because of some stupid sympathy?” the female butterfly elf vehemently pleaded.

        ‘She’s right… My wife, with her wings forcibly torn away, must be enduring insufferable pain… If we…if we just turn the gladiospina in to the phantocaudas, we can bring everyone back…’

        As Evander’s mind painted a beautiful picture of his people reuniting safely with his wife smiling bashfully, he succumbed to the allure of that illusional happiness.  The longing for his kin’s reunion subdued his guilt over betraying the gladiospina and he began devising a plan.

        ‘Right, Mistilteinn was injured while protecting us earlier. We can render her unconscious by applying some sleeping powder to her wounds…’

        Finally, selfish desire triumphed over conscience.

        Evander lifted his head and surveyed his fellow elves before he spoke, “I’ll do it. I will bring everyone back.”

        However, it was later proved to be a naive decision for Evander to believe the Phantocaudas’ words. He betrayed Mistilteinn the gladiospina, and received only the bloody, lifeless bodies of his kin, marking the beginning of yet another tragic tale…</p>
