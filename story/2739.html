        <h1>Fealty of the Amazon - Mesopotamia</h1>
        <p>
                Lining up on both sides of the hall, the ministers welcomed the emissary of the neighboring country and his team, who came in with livestock and valuable gifts. On the litter in the middle sat a woman. A sheet of scrim draped over the litter, covering her figure.

        The leading emissary opened the treasure box in his hand and handed it to King Dumuzi, said, “This is a gift from our princess for making a proposal of marriage to the prince. ”

        “A marriage proposal?” Dumuzi was seemingly calm, yet he caught sight of Inanna who was standing beside and looking at him worriedly.

        “It’s time for our prince to settle down!”
        “Marrying the princess must benefit diplomatic relations between us and the neighboring country! ”
        “This is great news for both countries! We have to celebrate it!”

        After helping the envoys settle down, Dumuzi ended the morning court to have a private meeting. There were only Inanna, Mesopotamia and him in the room. 
　　
        Fondling her daughter’s cheek pitifully, Inanna said with worries, “We can’t hide it after all, can’t we?”

        “If we turn it down, it might hinder the diplomatic relations between two countries; but if we accept it, everything will be exposed,” said Dumuzi with a frown.

        Mesopotamia put her hand over her mother’s and said, “Mother, I’ll do whatever it takes to keep the country’s peace. But I can’t let other people’s daughter down so I have to turn down this marriage proposal.”

        “Meso… You always want the best for others.” Inanna gently caressed her daughter’s long hair with her fingers.

        “Father, let me handle it. I’ll talk to the princess myself.”

        Mesopotamia walked into the side hall where the princess was received. As soon as she closed the door she saw the princess come to her, trying to hug her. The tulle on the princess’s sleeves brushed past 

        Mesopotamia’s face with a hint of seduction. She immediately kept her balance and broke the fall. Then she subconsciously pushed the princess away.

        “Princess, please respect your…!” Before Mesopotamia could ever finish her sentence, she met the beautiful eyes of the princess, then she knew what was happening and asked,
“Chessia, what are you doing?”

        A bright flame appeared and burned down the tulle dress, revealing the true face of Chessia. Raising her eyebrow, she said, “I just wanted to know if you like your fiancée or not. Just by you pushing ‘her’ away, I’m happy with the answer.”

        “Stop messing around. Where’s the princess?”

        “Oh, why do you sound like you’re blaming me? I found her big secret when I broke in but I helped her instead. Come on in.” Chessia led Mesopotamia into a room in the side hall, in which she saw the real princess and a male guard.

        The princess got wound up as she caught sight of Mesopotamia. Chessia smiled at her and said, “Don’t worry. I believe the prince will help you.”

        It turned out that the king of the neighboring country brought the marriage proposal without asking the princess just to establish diplomatic relations. Yet, the princess already met the love of her life and even planned to elope on their way back to the kingdom if the prince accepted the proposal. She only loosened up a little bit after knowing that Mesopotamia had no intent to marry her.

        “But what about diplomatic relations? My father won’t just let it go.”

        “I have an idea. Princess, just leave it to me,” said Mesopotamia, sharing a mutual gaze with Chessia as if they knew each other’s minds.

        Chessia blinked and said, “You have to think twice, my prince.”

        On the wedding day, the sun blazed down on the golden bowls and silver plates on the feast table, reflecting bright golden light. The ministers and envoys toasted and sang along with the music for celebration.

        The suited Mesopotamia held the princess’s hand. In the sound of horns and cheers, together they walked up to the end of the staircase.

        As the two of them toasted, the princess pouted her lips, leaned forward on tiptoes, and looked at Mesopotamia flirtatiously. A tiny frown crossed Mesopotamia’s solemn face but it soon turned into a decent smile when she turned to greet the guests.

        “Cheers for the prince and princess!”

        At night, after they returned to their room, the princess threw herself on the bed and said, “Sigh, being a princess is really troublesome. This gown is so tight!” The princess took off the floral jewelry, stretched a little, and looked at Mesopotamia, who had walked to the window.

        “Now, the princess should be somewhere safe...”

        Mesopotamia was watching the scenery of trees and woods outside the window, which seemed more tranquil under the night sky. Suddenly a piece of white tulle covered her sight-a bridal veil was put on her head.

        Warmth came from the back of Mesopotamia’s neck and a sly whisper rang in her ears, “Do you know why I told you to think twice? Now you can’t get rid of me for your whole life.”

        The “princess” returned to her original appearance as Chessia. She gently lifted the veil and looked at Mesopotamia’s pondering face.

        Mesopotamia removed the veil and said, “You weren’t going to leave me anyway.”

        “Humph, then I’ll disappear at the state banquets, official duties and special ceremonies, when you most need the princess’s accompany—— ”

        “Inseparable, that’s good enough.” Mesopotamia reached and grabbed Chessia’s arm.

        Blushed crimson in a second, Chessia gave a coquettish gaze and said, “then, my prince, we shall be together forever, till eternity. ”</p>
