        <h1>Deep Bass Taiko - Hibiki</h1>
        <p>Oh My Youkai - Ch.3

        “Here we are, the tatami guesthouse of the Grand Villa. Folks, please stay close with me and don’t wander around. I’ll be leading you to the rooms now.”

        A tidy girl in wafuku was politely showing the guests around in the guesthouse. Inside the guesthouse, everything was in neat order with a peaceful vibe. The only strange thing was that there was a rotten smell lingering in the building. All the guests covered their noses, looking for the source of the smell.

        “Guuuuuuu——”

        The peace was broken by a weird noise out of the blue. Popping her eyes in a shock, the girl jumped to the pillar and explained, “no big deal. It’s just the humming from the birds. Hahaha.”

        The girl giggled as if she was trying to hide something. Then she put all her effort in chit-chatting, shifting everyone’s focus away from the noise until the guests arrived at their rooms.

        “Phew, that was close,” the girl relieved after checking all the guests in, wiping her sweats exhaustedly. All of a sudden, she sat on the floor in a rude manner and yelled at the grumbling pillar with an unmatching masculine voice, “HEY! Didn’t I tell you to keep quiet when the guests are here!?”

        Poof! A vague oval shape was revealed from the pillar. As the shape turned vivid, it gradually became a little racoon dog who sobbed, “but brother, we’ve been pretending this crappy house to be a delicate guesthouse while starving. It’s draining us…”

        All the other little racoon dogs revealed themselves when they saw one of their brothers had done so. All of them gathered around the girl in teary eyes. Meanwhile, the girl disabled “her” disguise too. Poof! When the magic smoke was gone, the curvy shape became short and fat. It turned out that the “girl” was Hibiki, the big brother of the little racoon dogs. Scratching his tummy, Hibiki’s attitude softened as he saw his pitiful little brothers.

        “Sigh...It’s also my fault…”

        Ever since Hibiki had got his taiko robbed by the landlord, the loss of power had turned them into slaves. Not only did they live a poor life, but the landlord’s ultimatum pushed them to the rock bottom. The landlord, upsetted by the tragic revenue, required a full house in a week, or he would barbecue all the youkai minions. Worst still, the youkai who had the least business would receive a punishment worse than death.

        In the meantime, new guests arrived to check in. Hibiki then begged his little brothers, “hang in there! I’ll search for food now. Wait for me!” 

        Whoosh! Hibiki jumped into the bushes to search for food.

        At this moment, a tree nearby the guesthouse rustled. The truth was that there lurked another youkai——Furry the komainu. 

        “I will drag you down with me,” Furry plotted cunningly, spying on Hibiki who had been barely running the guesthouse.

        Like the other youkais, Furry was threatened by the landlord. Aware of his disadvantage, he decided to sabotage the business of the others.

        Very soon, the guesthouse was filled with an intense aroma. The bake-danukis now had only one thing in their minds——“food”.

        “It smells like meat stew and soup with extra spice…”

        “It smells so good…”

        “Boohoo...I-I can’t take it——!”

        All of a sudden, the thinnest bake-dakuni lifted the illusion magic and stormed out of the guesthouse. The other siblings were unable to put up with the hunger, storming out of the building like a chain reaction.

        Poof! The illusion magic disappeared as the casters had left the guesthouse. Turns out the kimonos in the wardrobe were actually leaves, and the food served was just some cold, hard stones. When the guests took a bite, they got their teeth shattered by the stones. As the screams sounded one after another, all the guests began to flee the building in spite of the nudity.

        Meanwhile, cracks were revealed on the wall and the whole guesthouse went from a decent place to a complete ruin.

        “Hehe, Hikibi is out of the game. Easy peasy!” Furry, who used food as a trap, smiled in satisfaction.

        “What the heck!?”

        Hibiki dropped his jaw as he saw the complete ruin after his food hunt with only a few sweet potatoes. Hurrying to the land next to the guesthouse, he found his brothers sleeping with bulky tummies. Curry was all over their faces and there was an empty pot on the ground.

        “AFTER ALL MY HARD WORKS, SLEEPING IS ALL YOU’VE DONE——” the furious Hibiki yelled.

        “Sorry! We’ll go back to work now!” The bake-danukis woke up and apologized to their big brother immediately.

        “It feels so good to be well-fed and well-rested!”

        The bake-danukis casted the illusion magic, which shrouded the building with golden dazzle. When the halo faded, the building became more luxurious than ever——a six-floor complex with a vast lobby, shiny floor and high-end furnitures.

        “Wow! Look! There’s a beautiful hotel!”

        The hotel was soon fully booked. While Hibiki and his brothers were busy as bees, Furry was biting his handkerchief aggrievedly. 

        “Damn it. Not only I didn’t sabotage his business but I made their business thrive...I’ll be back!”
