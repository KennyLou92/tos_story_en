        <h1>King Ghidorah</h1>
        <p>King Ghidorah first appears in GHIDORAH, THE THREE HEADED MONSTER (1964), and was originally meant to be as powerful on its own as Mothra, Rodan and Godzilla put together. With a design reminiscent of the dragons of Asian mythology, King Ghidorah is covered in golden scales, has three heads (each atop a long undulating neck) and is able to fly with its powerful wings. The Gravity Beam is its primary destructive weapon, and its metallic screams can strike terror into the hearts of man and monster alike. With its devastating powers and terrifying beauty the marvelous King Ghidorah is Tohoâ€™s first and best space kaiju.</p>
