        <h1>Celestial Master - Tongtian Jiaozhu</h1>
        <p>        In front of a palace in the Heavenly Kingdom, someone was swinging a giant brush. Each move is strong and powerful.  Sweating profusely, he seemed to be venting his uneasiness and restlessness by means of exercise. 

        At this moment, a person came over and talked to him respectfully, “I’ve eliminated those demons in the Orient.”

        Tongtian Jiaozhu stopped his move and put the brush in his back.  “Ziya, I’ve said before.  It’s not necessary to report to me.  As a Celestial Master, You have full control on this thing,” he took a deep breath and responded.

        “Em...Understood.” Jiang Ziya paused, staring at the palace with anxiety.  The entrance at this moment was sealed by water element.  He hesitated for a while and spoke with a slight voice, “Is Yuanshi Tianzun alright?”

        “No worries, I’m sure he can pass the trial,” Tongtian Jiaozhu answered firmly.  No one knew Yuanshi Tianzun better than him.  Tongtian Jiaozhu was confident in him.

        Delegated by Yuanshi Tianzun, Taishang Laojun took up the responsibility to observe the Zodiacs.  However, he had a setback on a mission and could not get rid of it after returning to the Heavenly Kingdom.  Hence, Yuanshi Tianzun had set a trial for Taishang Laojun, guiding him to grow up, and ordered Tongtian Jiaozhu to stay in the kingdom and take care of him, so that Yuanshi Tianzun could deal with the Gods by heading towards the Enochian Tower.

        Everyone was fighting with the Gods for the Heavenly Kingdom, but Tongtian Jiaozhu could only stay behind and do nothing.  That’s why he was restless and tried to soothe his emotions by practicing.

        “You’re right.  I shouldn’t have overthought.  Anyways, I’ll see myself out.  Please let me know if you need any help——”

        Suddenly, a rumble disrupted Jiang Ziya’s words.  Then, a violent shake happened in the entire kingdom, raising clouds of dust and smoke everywhere. 

        “Enemies attack, darn it!  They know Yuanshi Tianzun is not here.  That’s why they try to raid on the kingdom,”  Tongtian Jiaozhu was displeased.
        “Perhaps the demons nearby do this?” Jiang Ziya asked.
        “No, they’re weak.  Only Gods could…”

        As Jiang Ziya was about to continue, a junior Xian yelled as he ran over.  “This is bad!  There are many god soldiers breaking in!”

        “As expected…” Tongtian Jiaozhu rode on his giant brush and flew towards the summit.  Troops of god soldiers kept attacking the magical barrier.   Sooner or later it would be cracked.

        “How dare they...I’ll go summon all the Xian——”
        “No, Ziya, let me handle it.  You stay and protect the palace with the others.  Don’t let the Gods interrupt Taishang Laojun’s trial!”

        Tongtian Jiaozhu leaped across the magic barrier and gazed at the god soldiers from the sky.  Fire elemental power was injected into the blush; flames had turned into several fireballs.  With a swing, a gigantic fireball was cast over the enemies, burning the ground like hell——

        “Is it over?” As Tongtian Jiaozhu looked down closely, he saw all the god soldiers are safe and sound.  They drew together to conjure a shield blocking his attack!

        “So this is God's power?” Tongtian Jiaozhu grinned with his eyes full of bellicosity.  “ I don’t have this kind of feeling for such a long time.  My blood is like boiling, yearning for a fight like this.”

        He sprinted towards the god soldiers with his blush.  Gathering strength, Tongtian Jiaozhu smashed the ground.  The impact cracked the surface, causing countless flames to turn them into ashes!  Witnessing his strength, the soldiers left dared not act recklessly.  “Are you scared,” Tongtian Jiaozhu taunted them about their cowardice. 

        “Bring it on!” The god soldiers roared while marching towards him.  Soon, Tongtian Jiaozhu was surrounded!  The others captured the chance to attack the magic barrier, which then began to crack after absorbing so many attacks——

        Suddenly, a huge noise was sent from behind!  Sensing a wave of heat coming over, the soldiers turned around and saw many of them were burnt to crisp already.  At this moment, Tongtian Jiaozhu, coated with fire, was walking towards the enemies. 

        “Now, who’s next?” He smiled.</p>
