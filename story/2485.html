        <h1>Corrupted Possession - Izanami</h1>
        <p>Finale of Yamato - Ch.1

        Izanami brought Kagutsuchi and Tsukuyomi to the abandoned village. However, Kagutsuchi had an epiphany of Izanagi’s intention after remembering a childhood memory. Much as he wanted to return home and apologize to his father, Izanami and Tsukuyomi found out 
 his plan. At last, he was stopped by Tsukuyomi with her magic.

        Izanami, believing that Kagutsuchi was ill, surrendered to the lingering female voice and began to kidnap children, hoping their hearts could heal her son. Yet the kidnapped children were discovered by Izanagi and Amaterasu, who were led to the same village by their investigation. The paths of Izanami and Izanagi crossed again…

        Izanami hopefully walked towards Izanagi. At this moment, she realized that she had a lot to tell him; And this time, she hoped that he would understand her and everything she had done.

        “...Izanagi, I——”

        “Why did you kidnap so many children?”

        Izanagi took the initiative to question with blame written on his face.

        “I was...trying to save Kagutsuchi, our son! He can only be cured by ingesting children’s hearts!”

        “So...saving Kagutsuchi is your justification for killing innocent people?”

        “But if I don’t do so, Kagutsuchi will be eventually killed by his spiritual energy——”

        “Izanami, when will you wake up from your wicked fantasy?”

        Izanami’s heart sank as she was denied by Izanagi again. Strong spiritual energy surged when Izanami became devastated and resentful.

        “Everything I do, I do it for our family!” Izanami gritted her teeth while scowling at Izanagi.

        At this moment, Izanami lost control of her spiritual energy, and countless white arms were grown out of her back!

        “Talking is redundant if you’ll never understand me!”

        Heartbroken, Izanami charged at Izanagi. Meanwhile, the white arms launched an intense wave of attacks against Izanagi. The devastated Izanami finally integrated with the black magic, and the same old tragedy was about to repeat in this village again...
