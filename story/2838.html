        <h1>Confined Religiosity - Ubbo</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.1

        Upon witnessing the injury inflicted upon Azathoth, the lord of creation, Daoloth, became uncontrollable, its powers spiraled into disarray and chaos. In a desperate attempt to save its lord, Ubbo heeded Daoloth’s command and set out to find the ethereal entity known as Ithaqua, the manifestation of fate. With the help of the remnants of Fthaggua and its dwindling power, Ubbo shattered the limits of dimensions and successfully summoned Ithaqua.

        After extracting the twisted essence from Daoloth, Ithaqua fell into a deep slumber, bereft of the capacity to further alleviate Daoloth’s impending collapse. Ubbo thought that Daoloth’s creation would cease forthwith lest it slipped into madness again. However, contrary to its wishes, Daoloth persisted in its determination to create, disregarding its imminent decay and demise.

        Ubbo, who had adored Daoloth since its birth, would not allow such misfortune to befall its lord. So it traversed the universe, seeking a method to save Daoloth, but all its attempts proved futile. Gasping for breath in the depths of despair, Ubbo, ventured to the edge of the cosmos to see Daoloth, its tower of strength, only to witness its lord’s corporeal form contorting and writhing in the harrowing grip of the twisted powers.

        The hidden distress with Ubbo could no longer be concealed. It knelt before Daoloth with tears streaming down its face, and pleaded in anguish, “Daoloth, you must forsake your creation to cease that endless hollow so that you won’t be consumed by distortion and wander in oblivion.”

        “It’s impossible,” Daoloth caressed Ubbo lovingly, uttering the cruelest words yet. “Ubbo, do not come to me anymore. Stay away from me. I do not wish to harm you.”

        “...So, you decided to forsake me, to face death alone…” Ubbo murmured softly, lowering its head, before giving a bitter laugh.

        Lifting its head, Ubbo fixed its gaze on Daoloth. Within its eyes shimmered an eerie, brilliant light. Then it declared, “No, no, Daoloth. I will not let that happen. You are the most supreme being and the purpose of my existence, so you must not fade into oblivion!”

        “Ubbo, you—” Daoloth’s words halted as Ubbo coiled its dragonic tail around it.

        Ubbo bellowed, “Do it now, the lord of Destruction!”

        “Damn you! Do not command me!” Azathoth roared in response, hurtling from the distant reaches of the universe while channeling its powers into its claws. With a mighty swing, it effortlessly clove open Doaloth’s metallic form and created a crevasse that exposed the pearlescent organs gleaming with galactic luminescence within.

        “Damned creator! Carve out the abhorrent instinct that dominates Daoloth!” Azathoth slithered forth to entwine around Daoloth’s body, taking Ubbo’s place to restrain it.

        “It is none of your concern!” To save Daoloth, Ubbo reluctantly agreed to collaborate with Azathoth and Yibb. Yet deep within, it harbored a deep-seated aversion toward the two wanton destroyers, particularly Azathoth, the very embodiment of destruction. Thus, it remained resolute to withhold any semblance of favor toward them.

        Leaving those words, Ubbo released its grip on Daoloth and compressed its form. It wriggled through the opening, intruding on Daoloth's body, only to have its eyes seared by a blinding radiance of minerals. Within the enigmatic expanse of Daoloth’s inner sanctum was an intricate network of metallic crystals that formed a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes. Each crystal, with its unique geometry, contributed to the harmonious functioning organs that filled this ethereal space.

        “The instinct… Where is the instinct that has relentlessly compelled Daoloth to create?” Ubbo closed its eyes, drawing upon the incongruous powers within it—the powers of Fthaggua’s remnants. After making an agreement with the destroyers, Yibb helped Ubbo familiarize itself with Fthaggua’s powers until it was able to unleash the dimension-breaking flames at will.

        Shattering the boundaries of dimensions, Ubbo scrutinized the surreal landscape of Daoloth’s inner realm from a higher perspective until it found the parasitic instinct—Daoloth’s heart, the locus of its emotions as well as the source of its distortion. Whenever Daoloth experienced emotional fluctuations, the instinct within its heart recoiled and thus distorted its will.

        “Found it— Cough!” Ascending the higher dimensions brought a searing impact on Ubbo’s soul. The excruciating pain gnawed at its sense while its will was subjected to unrelenting agony, forcing it to expel viscous fluids. Still, Ubbo’s determination to redeem Daoloth remained unquenchable.

        With a sacrificial resolve, Ubbo traversed through Daoloth’s inner realm. However, Ubbo’s intrusion was met with fierce resistance—Daoloth’s corporeal form’s natural defenses surged forth, launching wave after wave of powerful attacks, each aimed at expelling the intruder. Undeterred, Ubbo refrained from retaliating and absorbed all the pain for it understood that even the slightest counterstrike would inadvertently harm Daoloth, which was the last thing it wanted.

        By the time Ubbo reached Daoloth’s heart, Ubbo’s form had been battered and wounded and its consciousness was close to dissipation. It was its profound admiration for Daoloth that pushed it forward, serving as an unwavering beacon of hope.

        Ubbo raised its gaze to behold the spiraling metallic heart beneath the rusted crimson dome, which was pulsating with vigor. But to Ubbo’s astonishment, there were two distinct heartbeats—the instinct of creation had evolved into a separate existence while constantly eroding Daoloth.

        “Soon… Soon, I shall free you from this torment, Daoloth.” Ubbo whispered silently, climbing before Daoloth’s heart to entwine its scarred body around the pulsating organ and put its forehead against its metallic surface. An involuntary shiver coursed through its being as it felt an inorganic cold.

        “So this is your heart, my dear Daoloth. This should be the closest I’ve ever been with you.” After nuzzling against Daoloth’s heart for a while affectionately, Ubbo summoned its powers. A faint blue flame rose from its battered form, spreading into a vast abyssal azure blaze that heated up Daoloth’s atriums.

        The metallic heart, stimulated by the intense heat, throbbed rapidly as if it sensed the emergence of a crisis. Something moved incessantly within, racing towards the farthest corner away from Ubbo’s reach. Yet, it still failed to escape Ubbo’s keen sight. With a leap, it pounced forward, utilizing its sharp horns to pin down that fleeing culprit—the instinct of creation.

        In the moment of contact, the instinct of creation retaliated. A multidimensional force surged towards Ubbo, who found itself once again subjected to immense suppression, a process of complete negation. Soon, it lost its sense of self, its physical form dissolving into an amorphous mire, yet still alive.

        Ubbo’s unwavering faith in Daoloth retained its resolution, allowing it to maintain a clear sense of the path he sought, even in the absence of cognition. As it began to gather his strength anew, its soul collided with the vigorous crimson fire hidden within its body which responded to its call, swaying to conjure an illusory dragon figure.

        “Geegeegee! So this is the power of higher dimensions! Not bad, but still, not as good as I am!” The remnants of Fthaggua within the vessel of Ubbo proclaimed with manic fervor before burrowing into the depths of Ubbo’s soul, unleashing its final and most piercing powers.

        As the tongues of crimson and azure fire entwined, a blaze that transcended dimensional boundaries broke into the higher realms, aligning with the instinct of creation. Seizing control of the fiery tongues, Ubbo transformed them into a sharp, elongated blade with its mind and aimed precisely at the metallic heart. With utmost accuracy, it struck the twisted, kaleidoscopic mass that was dissimilar to the metallic core—

        Eeeek——!

        A screeching wail resounded sharply as the collision of high-dimensional powers rippled through the cosmos, shaking the very essence of the universe. The impact surged toward Ubbo, closest to the epicenter, further deteriorating its already fragmented form. Yet, Ubbo refused to release its grip on the blade of flames, exerting all its strength to deliver a downward, sweeping blow—

        “Get out of Daoloth’s body!” With a cry emanating from the depths of Ubbo’s soul, the instinct of creation was finally severed from Daoloth’s heart. The iridescent culprit immediately attempted to retreat, but Ubbo seized it firmly within its ravaged vessel before swiftly extricating itself from Daoloth’s body.

        “Destroy it now!” Exerting its last ounce of strength, Ubbo hurled the instinct of creation toward Azathoth and Yibb, and then, it plummeted into the depths of the cosmos as its body reached the point of exhaustion.

Across myriad breaches into the higher dimensions, the weight of transcendence had overburdened Ubbo’s soul and disentangled the tapestry of its memories, including its own name. Yet, amid such profound amnesia, one truth remained resolute and vivid in its soul—its indelible reverence for Daoloth.

        In its waning breaths, Ubbo lifted its disfigured and swollen eyes, tracing Daoloth’s countenance with an unblinking gaze. As Ubbo’s mortal existence neared its culmination, it beseeched not for its own self but harbored a singular desire—to steal another moment to behold Daoloth, seeking to etch its form upon the canvas of its diminishing sight, even if only for an ephemeral heartbeat.

        “Despite my deepest desires, alas, fate has ordained that my presence by your side shall not endure for all eternity. It is an unfortunate truth I deeply lament. Yet, amid the somber hues of this grandest misfortune, I’m still grateful for it is through the depths of my suffering that I must endure that the door to miracles may be opened.”

        “Though my eyes may never bear witness to the wonders that unfold. I humbly implore the hand of fate to take my unfulfilled presence as a sacrificial offering that graces your path with the most unimaginable marvels…”

        Ubbo closed its eyes, allowing its body to crumble and descend. Its scalding tears scattered throughout the cosmos along with its flesh until it sank into the depths of Tarones…</p>
