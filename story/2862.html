        <h1>Glory Stealer - Zeus</h1>
        <p>        In the distant and once glorious past, there was a time when the realm of gods still thrived with vitality and lushly forested land. Yet, one day, the vivid greenery was tainted by a trace of blood and broken pieces of flesh scattered on the ground, left by a ferocious beast that cruelly killed its prey.

        Suddenly, a figure approached the beast from afar. Towering and muscular, the man moved with stealth and silence, swiftly arriving behind the creature. Raising his weapon high, resolute and determined, he brought it down with a swift strike.

        “Argh—!” The beast released its prey, emitting a pitiful scream. It instinctively retaliated, but the young man had already anticipated its movements. He leaped back, evading the beast’s violent attack. Seizing the opportunity, he swiftly closed in again and delivered a fatal blow. The beast finally collapsed to the ground, its furious gaze fixed on the young man until its last breath.

        “Humph! The audacity to rampage in the sacred realm of the Holy Gods. You did it to yourself… Tut!” Zeus, the young man, was about to turn and leave when he noticed two more beasts which seemed to have been drawn by the howls of the previous beast. They approached Zeus with intense murderous intent, baring their teeth and snarling.

        “It won’t make a difference, no matter how many of you come!” Zeus channeled his power and conjured a mighty lightning bolt, unleashing a devastating strike upon the beasts lunging toward him.

        Boom! The ferocious beasts were reduced to charred remains, releasing the scent of seared flesh. The commotion caught the attention of nearby male Holy Gods.

        As the gods hurriedly arrived, they witnessed Zeus standing unscathed amidst the three beast corpses. Filled with awe, they gathered around him, praising him fervently. “Zeus, you’re truly powerful! You defeated such formidable beasts effortlessly. We owe the success of this mission to you.”

        There had been beasts invading the realm of gods, attacking both gods and divine creatures For the past few days. Addressing the serious casualties, the reigning King of Gods had gathered the elite to hunt down those beasts in the forest and protect their divine home. Zeus was one of the elite, and his accomplishments had garnered much attention. Despite slaying three beasts, Zeus humbly responded, “It was nothing. These three beasts were merely small fry. Their leader has yet to appear. We must defeat it to completely drive out the horde of beasts.”

        “But we haven’t been able to find any trace of their leader these past few days. We have no idea where it’s hiding—”

        “Ahhhhh—!” A scream interrupted Zeus’ conversation with the other Holy Gods. After they exchanged a glance, they nodded in unison and swiftly set off toward the source of the scream.

        It did not take long for them to spot a massive beast in the distance, towering above the nearby tall trees, with half of one of Zeus’ comrades in its mouth. Locking eyes with Zeus and his group, the beast let out a horrifying howl, its fierce crimson eyes glaring.

        With a loud thud, the beast leader pushed off with its hind legs, its agile body charging toward them like a flying arrow. Its unstoppable momentum left all the Holy Gods bewildered and helpless, frozen in place.

        “I can’t just stand here! I have to fight!” Zeus forcibly suppressed his fear and once again summoned his power, generating a blinding thunderbolt that streaked across the sky, aiming directly at the charging beast.

        The lightning struck accurately, hitting the beasts’ leader, causing it to stumble momentarily and let out a groan of pain. From a distance, Zeus gave a triumphant shout, “I did it! ….Wait…My thunderbolt did hit it, why hasn’t it collapsed?”

        Zeus’ jubilance completely shattered as he witnessed the beasts’ leader regain its footing and resume its charge, even more enraged than before. Its speed had increased significantly, and in the blink of an eye, it came to the front of Zeus and his comrades. Just as its sharp teeth were about to reach them—

        “Get down!” A rugged male voice suddenly resounded, carrying an irresistible dominance. Zeus and the other Holy Gods instinctively followed his instruction, dropping to the ground. In the next instant, an arrow infused with tremendous power ripped through the air and directly hit the beast’s right eye.

        “ARGHHH—!” The beast let out a cry of agony, losing its balance and crashing to the ground. Yet, the attack did not end as a man wielding a long came, riding atop a magnificent cerapter.

        “Nero, use your blessings,” the man, Prometheus, spoke as he lowered his head and addressed the cerapter beneath him. The cerapter, named Nero, blinked its lustrous eyes and obediently responded, “Yes, Prometheus.”

        As Nero closed her eyes and channeled her power, a radiant glow emanated from her spiral golden horn, gradually spreading until it enveloped Prometheus. Sensing the transfer of power,         Prometheus put his longbow back on his back and leaped down from Nero. Hovering in mid-air, he unsheathed his sword and mustered his power with blazing flames appearing in his right eye.

        Meanwhile, the beast had recovered from its pain and once again stood upright. It roared toward Prometheus, the one who had inflicted the most harm upon it. With a powerful push from its hind legs, its massive body soared through the air and lunged at Prometheus. Yet, Prometheus remained unfazed. He evaded the beast’s attack simply by shifting his body slightly to the side. Then, with an agile turn, he raised his sword and brought it down—

        Swish! His strike cleanly severed the beast’s head from its body. The beast’s colossal head, whether by coincidence or design, happened to fall right in front of Zeus, splattering him in foul-smelling blood and leaving him in a disheveled state.

        However, none of the other Holy Gods present came to Zeus’ aid. Instead, they all rushed to surround Prometheus and Nero, their expressions filled with fervor and adoration. The sight reminded Zeus of the painful memories he had experienced not long ago.

        “Here we go again… It’s just like the day when he tamed the Sacrapter. I should have been the one commanding everyone’s attention. But why? Why does it always end up being Prometheus stealing the spotlight?!” Contemplating, Zeus could not help but let his gaze fall upon Nero, the Sacrapter standing beside Prometheus. She was as beautiful as when Zeus first laid eyes on her—her fur as white as freshly fallen snow, her body agile and graceful, her spiral horn resplendent and flawless, and most importantly, her unique power of blessings.

        “It’s because Prometheus has Nero. It’s that extraordinary power that helped him to effortlessly defeat the beasts’ leader… Dammit!”

        Unable to suppress the jealousy and malice brewing within him, Zeus let his gaze transform into a fierce and malevolent glare directed at Prometheus. The last piece of goodness that lingered in his heart vanished completely, consumed by his resentful desires.

        Gritting his teeth, he whispered silently, ‘I won’t let you take everything from me again. I will strip you of your radiance, by fair means or foul. Prometheus, I want you to lose everything.’</p>
