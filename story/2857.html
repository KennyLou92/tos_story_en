        <h1>Flawless Disguise - Diamond</h1>
        <p>        In a bedroom, a teenage minerelf was tossing and turning on his bed. Suddenly, a creak of the door startled him. He lifted his head to take a look only to be stunned by the beautiful “girl” standing by the door. Yet, the teenage elf knew clearly that the “girl” was actually a “him” not a “she” because they had been best friends for a long time.

        “Diamond!”  The teenage minerelf, Onyx, shouted out the “girl’s” name. Then he asked, “What are you doing in my bedroom so late at night and dressing like that?”

        Diamond, who was gazing at Onyx quietly, flashed a brilliant smile when he heard Onyx’s question. His exquisite face looked even more beautiful in the silver light. With a disarming chuckle, Diamond let his gaze roam over Onyx, then he slowly said, “But it seems you like it very much.”

        Diamond walked toward the bed step by step after saying those words. His smile seemed to have bewitched Onyx, who could only watch as Diamond climbed onto his bed until he felt an electric jolt to his body when his best friend touched his thigh—

        “Woah—!” Onyx sat up straight with a scream. He let out a sigh of relief as he found that Diamond was not in his room, and he murmured to himself, “So it was a dream—”

        Before Onyx’s voice trailed off, someone suddenly opened the door. It was Diamond in some girl’s clothing, walking toward him step by step. A strange feeling of déjà vu plunged the teenage minerelf into a state of bewilderment.

        “Am I… still dreaming?”

        Onyx soon got his answer—Diamond gave a slap on the back of his head mercilessly with a bang.

        “Ouch! That hurts!” Diamond’s slap brought Onyx’s mind back to reality. Glaring at Diamond, Onyx asked, “What was that for?”

        “The sun is up. But I saw that you were still sleepy so I just kindly woke you up. How was that?”

        “Well, thanks to you, I’m now all awake!” Feeling wronged, Onyx asked Diamond in annoyance, “What are you doing in my bedroom in the early morning? Besides, why do you dress like that… Don’t tell me you got addicted to dressing like a girl after trying it for the first time.”

        In order to escape from taking the throne, Diamond made a bet with his grandfather that he would get his wish if he managed to attend the Minerelf Girls’ School while disguising himself as a girl without exposing his true identity until graduation. That was why Diamond went to Onyx dressed in a girl’s uniform to see if his disguise was perfect.

        “Although you said I’m perfect in the girl’s uniform last time, I had this feeling that I needed to expand my sample base when I got back home. Then I saw this,” said Diamond, who showed Onyx an advertising poster.

        “New restaurant opening… A special buy-1-get-1-free dining offer for couples… The food does seem delicious but what does it have to do with you?”

        “It is a great chance for a test!” Diamond said emotionally. “Let’s go to the restaurant and have dinner as a couple. If we get that offer without anyone doubting us, that will prove that my disguise is truly perfect!”

        “Huh? You and I as a couple?!”

        “Yes! Enough with the talking! I heard that the restaurant is very popular so we have to get there earlier to get in line. So hurry up and get changed!”

        Left with no choice, Onyx changed his clothes and went to the restaurant with Diamond. The two managed to get a table in the first round. As soon as they were seated, they found themselves surrounded by affectionate couples who were either drinking from one glass or feeding each other food. Their public display of affection made Onyx feel awkward.

        On the other hand, Diamond had a good time. He took a full plate of food and started wolfing them down. He even gave a positive comment, “The food here is delicious! Go take some!”

        “O-okay.” Even though Onyx felt out of place, he took some food and began eating as he saw Diamond enjoying himself, suppressing the inexplicable feeling in his chest.

        “There’s new food! I’ll go get it!” Diamond rushed to the buffet table excitedly only to hear a commotion in the staff-only corridor. Out of curiosity, he stuck his head around the wall to see what the commotion was about. Then, he saw a man grabbing a waitress’ wrist while leaning toward her brazenly. It was clearly an act of molestation.

        Enraged by the sight, Diamond strode to the man and felled him with a punch in the face. Holding his face, the man glared at Diamond and shouted, “Ho-ho-how could you punch me?! This is not how a girl should act!”

        “Humph! No one can tell how a girl should act! There’s nothing wrong with defending oneself! Besides, who told you that I’m a girl?” Diamond looked down at the male staff with his arms folded before his chest, excluding an incredible masculine vigor and dominance.

        “You-you’re a boy?!”

        “Yeah, but that is none of your business. Now apologize to her!”

        “I—” The man sized up Diamond, thinking that he might have a chance over the slim minerelf. Just when he was about to hit back, someone burly came to the corridor.

        “Diamond!” It was Onyx, who came to find Diamond after seeing that he had gone for a long time. He sensed the hostile atmosphere in the corridor as he walked closer so he lowered his head and asked Diamond worriedly, “What happened?”

        “This bastard was going to molest the girl. I couldn’t stand it and gave him a punch but it seems that he hasn’t learned his lesson.”

        “What?” Onyx’s face darkened in an instant. He walked to the front of Diamond and stared at the man. As the man saw how brawny Onyx was, the man immediately dropped to his knees and begged for mercy, “I’m sorry! I was wrong!”

        Afterward, the man was kicked out of the restaurant. The waitress thanked Diamond and Onyx and even brought them dessert as a token of her appreciation. However, Diamond was rather unhappy because the people in the restaurant now knew that he was a boy.

        “Sigh… People still found out that I’m a boy.”

        Diamond remained depressed until the waitress handed him the bill.

        “I think we got the wrong bill. Why do we have 50% off?” Diamond asked in confusion.

        “It’s the right bill.” The waitress answered enthusiastically with her eyes moving around Diamond and Onyx, “Our restaurant also welcomes homosexual couples!”

        The waitress’ passionate enthusiasm made it hard for Diamond to clarify himself so he could only pay the bill quietly. As soon as the two minerelves stepped out of the restaurant, Diamond stroked his chin thoughtfully and asked Onyx, “So does it mean my disguise works…”</p>
