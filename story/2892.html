        <h1>Mercenary’s Dream - Felix</h1>
        <p>        The resounding clash of metal echoed through an elegant garden as two young men crossed their foils in a friendly duel at the training ground. The younger of the two seemed eager to conclude the match, his movements so brash and unrefined that his opponent swiftly gained the upper hand and disarmed him after a few exchanges.

        “Brother, you’re as formidable as ever,” Felix, the younger man remarked with a gracious smile instead of a crestfallen frown, looking at his elder brother, Krell, with respect.

        However, Krell did not return Felix’s compliment. He merely cast a glance in his younger brother’s direction before sheathing his sword and walking toward the edge of the training ground.

        ‘Tut! He’s just as cold as ever,’ Felix inwardly muttered. Scratching his nose in embarrassment, he followed Krell, joining the middle-aged man, their father, who had been watching their match from the sidelines.

        “Father,” Krell respectfully greeted his father.

        “You’re in good shape, Krell,” the man responded with a calm nod and said, “Keep it up.”

        “Thank you, Father.”

        The man then turned his gaze toward Felix, the look on his face instantly turning into one of stern displeasure as he reprimanded his other son, “Felix, what was that just now?”

        “What do you mean, Father? I simply couldn’t beat Krell, that’s all,” Felix shrugged nonchalantly. Yet, his flippant attitude only further deepened his father’s furrowed brow.

        “You couldn’t or you didn’t want to beat him?” Felix’s father saw through his lie with a single glance and posed a sharp question.

        “I—” While Felix was thinking up an excuse, Krell stepped forward, lowering his head slightly as he whispered to their father, “Father, it’s almost time to meet with the Duke.”

        “Indeed, it is time.” The man fixed his gaze on Felix, his eyes sharp, carrying a hint of intimidation as he spoke in a low, commanding tone, “I will let it pass this time, but do not let me witness such misconduct ever again.”

        “Yeah, got it, got it,” Felix hastily nodded, clearly unapologetic for his performance. As much as the man wished to teach his younger son a lesson, he ultimately restrained himself and departed with Krell before giving Felix one last steely glare.

        ‘Phew, finally it’s over,’ Felix breathed out a sigh of relief. “I must hurry before it gets dark, or they’ll be gone!”

        Felix hurriedly changed his clothes and left the estate, making his way to the bustling docks where a small tent stood. Inside the tent sat a group of burly men who exuded an imposing aura—clearly they were not any common townsfolk but seasoned fighters.

        The men were a group of world-renowned mercenaries who took on commissions from various countries and pursued quests of legendary treasures. For the common danger and risks involved in their missions, the group had a constant need to replenish their ranks as losses occurred, leading them to periodically recruit new members from wherever they arrived, and coincidentally, they arrived in Felix’s hometown this time.

        As someone who had dreamed of embarking on adventures across the world since childhood, Felix, of course, did not miss out on such a rare opportunity. He secretly applied and took the test without his family’s knowledge, and today was the day when the results would be announced, which explained his eagerness to conclude the match with Krell earlier.

        ‘Great! I made it just in time!’ Felix thought elatedly as he caught sight of a burly man coming out from the tent in the distance.

        The man hung a long piece of parchment, a list of names, dozens, outside the tent. A crowd quickly gathered around, all impatient to see if their names had made it onto the list.

        “Excuse me, coming through!” Felix squeezed his way through the crowd. As he finally reached the forefront, he eagerly scanned the parchment, only to find his name absent.

        ‘This can’t be! How can I not have been recruited?’ Felix, refusing to accept the reality, pushed through the crowd and rushed into the tent, questioning the mercenaries loudly, “Sorry, but why isn’t my name on the list?

        “If your name isn’t on the list, you simply didn’t make the cut. What else could there be?”

        “But I was the top in the combat test that day. How could I not make it onto the list?”

        “The top? Oh, so it was you,” one of the mercenaries looked at Felix with confusion as he said, “You did make it onto the list, but we removed you after you withdrew your application.”

        “Withdrew my application? That’s ridiculous! I didn’t do that!”

        “But we did receive a letter,” the mercenary retrieved a letter which indeed had Felix’s signature and handwritten request to withdraw his application. “Frankly, our leader was quite disappointed to miss out on a promising member like you.”

        Although the handwriting was almost identical to Felix’s, he immediately recognized the letter as forged. “It must be Father’s doing!”

        Boiling with rage, Felix stormed back to the estate. He barged into his father’s study regardless of the butler’s interference and forcefully slammed the forged letter on the desk.

        “Did you do this?”

        “Felix, I never taught you to talk to your father in such a disrespectful manner,” Felix’s father, displeased, said with an unapproving gaze. However, even his condemnatory gaze could not shake Felix’s burning anger and unwavering determination to demand, “Answer me.”

        The room fell into a strained silence for a moment until Felix’s father let out a sigh, “Yes, I asked the butler to withdraw your application.”

        “Why?”

        “Because I couldn’t fathom my own son being so foolish to become a lowly mercenary, ” Felix’s father remarked, his eyes holding a hint of disdain.

        “You could have at least talk to me even if you did not wish me to become a mercenary,” Felix emotionally argued, “How could you forge a letter and withdraw my application without my consent? That’s my life!” 

        “Your life?” Felix’s father chuckled scornfully, “Felix, I did not spend so much money on you so that you could make reckless decisions.”

        “Reckless decisions?” Felix repeated his father’s words in disappointment. “So what now? I’m nothing but just a puppet to you?”

        “If that’s how you think of me, then let it be, but you are never becoming a mercenary.” Felix’s father took out a letter and and a photo of a young woman. “I have talked to the Duke for a position for you. You shall start working in a few days. And this is the Duke’s daughter. Her age matches yours. Your engagement shall be announced next year so remember to make yourself acquainted with her before then.”

        “Ha… Hahaha, so this is the life you’ve arranged for me,” Felix gave a bitter laugh as he looked at the documents on the table, finding the situation utterly absurd.

        Meeting his father’s infuriated gaze, he firmly said, “Sorry to disappoint you, but I have no interest in living a meaningless life that has been prewritten by you,” Felix said. He then turned to leave, only to be surrounded by the five servants who had been waiting by the door.

        “Felix, it is not your place to disobey me,” Felix’s father commanded in a deep voice, “Take Felix to his room. He is not to leave his room without my permission, and give him no water or food.”

        “Yes, Sir!” The servants chorused. They restrained Felix and sent him back to his room before locking the door.

        Yet, Felix did not give up; he planned to escape through the window. However, his father seemed to have thought one step ahead of him—he had sealed all the windows, forcefully thwarting Felix’s attempt.

        “Damn it… I will not surrender!” Felix shouted in frustration. Still, the pangs of hunger and thirst gradually gnawed at his resolve, weakening him day by day. Nevertheless, he refused to yield.

        Just as Felix thought he might perish quietly in his room, a ray of hope came to his door.

        In the dead of night, the locked door opened, revealing a tall figure standing at the entrance. Felix discerned the comer by the faint light.

        “Brother…”

        “Eat,” Krell looked Felix, who had been weakened by hunger. He handed over a bottle of milk and a loaf of bread, which Felix immediately devoured.

        “Felix, do you still insist on your decision?” Krell inquired.

        “Yes. I’d rather die than living in subjugation,” Felix replied with a smile.

        “...Then go,” Krell tossed Felix a travel bag. From the bag’s weight, Felix could tell it was filled with a significant amount of valuables.

        “What?”

        “Since you’d rather die than stay here, then leave. I’ve sent the servants away,” Krell said.

        “But wouldn’t Father take his anger out on you if you let me go like this?”

        “He’s already lost one of his sons; he wouldn’t risk losing another,” Krell said with a rare sense of humor, “The best he could do is to scold me.”

        “Thank you, brother,” Felix said with profuse gratitude.

        “There’s no need to thank me; I’m happy as long as you live safe and sound,” Krell smiled gently. “Now go, Felix, live a wonderful life that only belongs to you.”

        Felix stood up and gave his brother a tight squeeze. Then he shouldered the bag and walked toward the door, heading toward the world of freedom he had long dreamed of...</p>
