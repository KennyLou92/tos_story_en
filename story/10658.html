        [b][i]Battle cruiser Montana Log Entry: Day 364 of the 99th Year

        Scáthach’s Emotional System Status: Overexcited

        Observation: The century-long patrol mission is nearing its completion. We will soon return to the active zones of the universe.

        Action: Remind Scáthach to focus on her daily duties, lest her excitement distract her from the tasks.

        ……

        It is impossible to predict the future, but regardless, I, Montana, will forever protect Scáthach.[/i][/b]


        The piercing alarm reverberated throughout the compartments of Montana, the battle cruiser, startling the young girl, Scáthach, who was standing in the incineration chamber.

        A hundred years ago, Montana and Scáthach were created by a group of researchers. Given a mission to uphold universal security, they patrolled the vast expanse of space for a century. Finally, their century-long mission had come to an end, and they were heading back to the Spiral Star, the home planet of machinas. However, during their journey, they encountered a tourist spacecraft under attack by a Midden. Two machinas came to the spacecraft’s rescue but the male machina fell into the Midden’s grip. Without hesitation, Montana and Scáthach intervened to save the machina before the Midden crushed him.

        Little did they know that the two machinas were special agents sent to apprehend them. They were later forced to face another cruelly stunning truth that the century-long mission they had carried out was nothing but a lie! It turned out that a century ago, one of the battlecruisers had gone out of control, causing a massive catastrophe. As a result, the Heptara Unies announced its verdict and ordered the destruction of all battlecruisers to prevent similar accidents.

        However, one of the researchers could not bear to see them destroyed so she released all battlecruisers, including Montana and Scáthach, before the execution. She even overwrote their program, sending them to space for false missions. 

        A hundred years later, an agent attempted to use innocent passengers as leverage to force Scáthach to hand over the control of Montana. In a twist of fate, another Guide, Nuada, a boy who had come to seek revenge, delivered a fatal blow to the agent. Thankfully, New Hampshire, Nuada’s destroyed battlecruiser, temporarily reappeared and convinced Nuada to let go of his resentment.

        However, the peaceful moments did not last long as an ominous alarm blared.

        “Mo-Monty! What’s happening?” Scáthach asked anxiously, her voice trembling, turning to the male android beside her. It served as a remote terminal of Montana the battleship.

        “Three battlecruisers are coming toward us at a high speed,” Montana replied with a tone of rare solemnity, indicating the gravity of the situation.

        “It’s New Jersey!” exclaimed Nuada, who stood beside them.

        “New Jersey?” Kepler, the male agent from the Oroz Management Center, who was half-kneeling on the ground supporting his partner, Laura, furrowed his brow upon hearing Nuada’s words. “You mean the runaway battle cruiser? How do you know it’s him?”

        “...Because we have joined forces,” Nuada reluctantly answered Kepler’s question. He continued, “I sneaked into the tourist spacecraft to kidnap Rosaline, the former chief of the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research. New Jersey and the other Guides were supposed to come only when I signaled them, but I didn’t do it, so I don’t know what are they doing here…”

        “Regardless, let’s head to the control room and contact them,” said Montana, making the decision.

        After ensuring that Laura was settled in a comfortable rest, Kepler joined Montana as they made their way to the control room.

        There Scáthach initiated a call request to New Jersey, and he accepted promptly.

        A translucent screen appeared in mid-air, revealing the image of a robust male humanoid—the remote terminal of New Jersey.

        Glancing briefly at Nuada standing beside Scáthach, New Jersey coldly remarked, “So, you’ve betrayed us, Nuada.”

        “No, I didn’t! New Jersey, please listen to me. Scáthach and the others mean no harm. We can—”

        “Enough!”  New Jersey decisively interrupted Nuada’s explanation, speaking in an indifferent tone, “I won’t trust anyone anymore, not even another Guide. I will claim justice in my own way.”

        “Wait! What are you planning to do?”

        “Since they want to capture us, I will let them know what consequences they’re facing. I will show them my powers and make them suffer, so they won’t come after us again,” New Jersey stated.

        “You will only make things worse!” Kepler rushed forward and shouted at New Jersey as his patience snapped.

        “Are you saying that we should just surrender and let you destroy us?” New Jersey sneered disdainfully at Kepler, anger lacing his words. “Even if we’re destined to be destroyed, I will still make you all suffer!”

        With a sharp click, New Jersey mercilessly ended the call and altered his course.

        “They’re accelerating toward the nearest inhabited planet,” Montana stated.

        “Wh-wh-what? Are they planning to…destroy that planet?” Scáthach exclaimed in shock.

        “That’s probably it,” Nuada nodded. “New Jersey proposed it once but didn’t think we would involve the innocent. So, I suggested kidnapping a prominent member of the Heptara Unies as a bargaining chip for negotiations. It took me a lot of effort to convince New Jersey, but now it seems he never trusted me all along.”

        “New Jersey seems to have a deep distrust of  Guides. Is there a reason behind it?” Montana inquired.

        “New Jersey’s Guide sold him in exchange for their own safety. It nearly caused New Jersey’s destruction. He narrowly escaped the execution, and probably since then, he has a hard time trusting anyone,” Nuada explained.

        “Oh… No wonder he’s so extreme,” Scáthach sighed with pity. She asked, “But what do we do now? We can’t just do nothing and watch them blow up an entire planet…”

        “The other two Guides are still in their battleships, although they’re most likely held captive in their battlecruisers. If we can get in and free them, we can take the battlecruisers under control and stop them from attacking the planet. However, New Jersey is our biggest problem because his Guide is no longer with him…”

        Bang! Kepler thumped the table in frustration and growled resentfully, “Damn it! If only we hadn’t lost the key of Lilith!”

        “The key of Lilith?” Scáthach tilted her head, pondering, and pulled out a mechanical sphere from her pocket. “Do you mean this?”

        Kepler’s eyes widened in surprise. He hastily took the sphere from her and examined it carefully. A rare expression of joy crossed his face as he exclaimed, “Yes! That’s it! Why do you have it?”

        “After Monty repelled the Midden, I saw this floating in space. It looked pretty so I picked it up… Is it important to you?”

        “Yes! With this, we can hack into the battleships’ systems and take control of them!”

        “Then it seems we have a plan,” Montana said with crossed arms, outlining their final arrangements. “Let’s split into three groups. We sneak into the battleships, help the Guides take control of them, and stop the catastrophe!”

        And so, Nuada and Kepler headed to the other two battleships, while Scáthach, carrying the key of Lilith, made her way toward New Jersey. Montana, on the other hand, protected the passengers while providing support and assistance.

        For easy communication, Scáthach, Nuada, and Kepler were all wired up with Montana’s remote terminal devices.

        Nuada and Kepler successfully located the Guides within the battleships. With their assistance, the Guides regained control over the ships, preventing them from reaching the inhabited planet.

        Through several perilous moments, Scáthach also made her way to the center of New Jersey. She used the key of Lilith to seize control of the vessel.

        Sensing something amiss, New Jersey dispatched his humanoid to stop Scáthach. However, Scáthach defeated him with solely her agile combat skills. As he lay on the ground, he could only watch helplessly as control was gradually stripped away, consumed with resentment.

        “Damn it… Damn it… They created me without my consent, and then they decided to destroy for no reason… That’s unfair…so unfair! I will make you all pay!”

        New Jersey seethed with anger, his eyes turning a fiery red as if he was burning his final reserves of power. A blinding light suddenly burst out from his humanoid with numerous delicate metal conduits protruding from his body. They bypassed Scáthach’s restraints and directly connected to the kinetic core, swiftly injecting the radiance into its depths.

        “Anti...anti-matter element projectile… request launch… Denied… Denied… Launch confirmed,” a mechanical voice sounded from above. Its contents left Scáthach in terror.

        “Ar-are you out of your mind? How can you launch an anti-matter element projectile? It will consume everything within its radius!”

        “Ha, isn’t that just perfect?” New Jersey revealed a twisted, ecstatic smile. “Let us all just die together.”

“You—”

        “Scáthach, don't argue with him,” Montana’s gentle voice resonated from the communication device, calming Scáthach's emotions slightly.

        “But what do we do now?”

        “Don’t worry. Leave it to me. I will stop that projectile,” Montana declared confidently. Meanwhile, he began to evacuate the passengers inside the ship, ensuring they returned to the tourist spacecraft.

        “How are you gonna stop it?” Scáthach had a sense of foreboding, which was revealed by the abnormal fluctuations in her emotional system.

        “......Scáthach, I will protect you, no matter what.” Instead of answering Scáthach’s question, he simply restated the only principle he had upheld for the past century in a softer tone.

        As a matter of fact, Montana had long sensed something was amiss back in the second year of their patrol mission. Throughout their first year of patrolling, they received no external contact nor any request for reporting. The zone they had been assigned to was practically desolate; it was as if they did not even have a target to patrol for.

        Nevertheless, Montana remained silent because he did not want to disappoint Scáthach, nor did he want to shatter her beautiful dream. So, he pretended everything was fine and continued patrolling with her, always prepared to protect her at all costs.

        “No! Monty! You can’t do this! You can’t just leave me alone—” It suddenly dawned on Scáthach what Montana’s plan was. She screamed at the communication device, her voice tinged with desperation. Yet, Montana did not respond but simply quietly listened to Scáthach.

        “I know Monty is brilliant. I know you’ll be fine even without me, but I won’t!”

        As soon as Montana confirmed that all the passengers had boarded the tourist spacecraft through the surveillance monitor, he opened the gate, allowing the spacecraft to depart from the battleship. He then initiated the transformation command once the spacecraft reached a safe distance. The grand battleship swiftly shifted into a giant robot as it switched to battle mode.

        “I’m so clumsy, useless, and reckless. I would have probably disappeared in some magnetic fields or been sucked into a black hole if it weren’t for you all the time…”

        “Speed restrictions lifted.” All engines of Montana had been started and pushed beyond the limits that they could bear. Like a flash of light in the cosmos, Montana speedily caught up with the anti-matter elemental projectile that was hurtling toward the planet.

        “We accomplished our century-long mission and we can finally live the life we’ve dreamed of! How could you leave me now? We have plans to go see the Enochian Tower together, remember? Monty! Please, I’m begging you! Come back! Monty!”

        Just moments before the robot was about to collide with the projectile, Montana activated his self-destruct program. In the final countdown, he finally spoke amidst Scáthach’s anguished cries, “Scáthach, I’m sorry I can’t keep my promise.”

        “Boohoo… Montana… Please… don’t leave me… I can’t live without you…” Scáthach, standing in the battle cruiser New Jersey, was choked with tears. In desperation, she stumbled toward the floor-to-ceiling window, staring at the distant edge of the universe despite being fully aware that she would not see Montana.

        “I don’t want to leave you either, but I have to go,” Montana whispered as he extended his arms and held the blazing projectile. He could feel the surface of his body melting. Alarms blared incessantly, indicating that his body was suffering severe damage.

        Montana knew time was running out. He said from the bottom of his heart, “Scáthach, thank you for everything for all these years. It has been a great pleasure to venture through space with you.”

        “No! Don’t! Please don’t leave me alone! Montana!” Scáthach shouted with all her strength, still, she could not escape the cruel fate.

        Boom—

        A powerful explosion occurred alongside a blinding light that illuminated the boundless and dark universe as bright as the day until Montana completely disappeared...</p>
