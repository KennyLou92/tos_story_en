        <h1>Komatsuhime the Earth-blessed Princess</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 2

        ‘Dad!’ Seeing a sword cutting through her father’s right shoulder, Komatsuhime let out an agonized cry and ran downhill in desperation immediately.

        ‘Komatsuhime!’ shouted Yukimura, who tried to catch up with Komatsuhime yet his hurting wound threw him off balance. He fell to the ground and thus could only watch her figure gradually disappear before his eyes.

        Komatsuhime ran desperately through the dense woods downhill; her skin was covered with cuts and scratches left by the bare branches. Blood seeped out of her wounds and dripped to the ground, laying a trail of sweet scent that lured the hunters hidden in the forest.

        ——Huff… Puff…

        “Some-something is following me!” That strange panting sound alarmed Komatsuhime. She wanted to turn around and look but her sense of crisis was aroused as she felt a rapid change in the air so she jumped sideways at once——
　　
        Boom! A “giant” slammed into the spot where Komatsuhime had been standing, creating a cloud of sand. Komatsuhime tried to open her eyes to see that unexpected assailant while covering her mouth and nose with her hands, only to find a nauseating picture——

        That “giant” was formed by a bunch of twisted and entangled mad man bodies. The mad men were clearly dead yet they were still roaring and growling while swinging their unbroken limbs. It was a bizarre and ghoulish creature that whoever saw would be stunned.

        “What-what is this… It’s horrible…” As much as Komatsuhime wanted to turn around and flee, she suppressed her fear as the picture of her injured father flashed across her mind. “No! I have to save Dad! How can I back down like this now!”

        ‘Get out of my way!’ At Komatsuhime’s shout, the pearl necklace on her neck shone brightly and turned into a wand in her hand. Grasping the wand tightly, she could feel that the wand drained away most of her strength, and her mind began to go blank.

        “It’s happening again… My mind seems to be dominated by something every time I use this wand…” As Komatsuhime recalled the despair of falling into illusions that she would never want to experience again, she decisively bit the tip of her tongue hard. Pain spread in her mouth with the smell of blood.

        The pain forcibly made Komatsuhime’s rigid mind function again, allowing her to control the wand at her will. ‘Come to me, the guardian of stone!’

        Following Komatsuhime’s call, a golem as big as the mad man chimera rose from the ground. It charged at the chimera and brought the latter down to the ground. Then it held its stony fist up high and started thumping on the monster.

        The monster struggled desperately to break free from the golem’s shackles but failed so it could only meekly take in the attacks. The mad men’s screams and cries of pain soon fell into silence.

        ‘Phew… I-I did it.’ Komatsuhime sat on the ground in exhaustion. Just when she was going to take a break, she heard a familiar call from a short distance.

        ‘Komatsuhime! Where are you?’ Honda, who seemed to have gotten rid of his enemy, went into the woods to find Komatsuhime. The father and his daughter were now only a dozen steps away.

        ‘Dad! You stop right there! I’m coming!’ As Komatsuhime saw Honda, she felt strength coming back to her weary body so she stood up and ran to her father.

        Hearing Komatsuhime’s words, Honda immediately stopped. His face creased into an elated smile as he watched his daughter running toward him. His smile spread to Komotsuhime’s face as if it was contagious. However, what happened next turned their smile upside down——

        A kunai knife shot Komatsuhime in her unarmed back, ripping right through her heart and inevitably bringing her to the ground. Honda, whose eyes were rimmed with red after seeing what had happened, shrieked in mad agony, ‘Komatsuhime——!’  

        Honda wanted to walk to where Komatsuhime was, but his feet somehow went weak and heavy so he could only stumble his way to her. His hands were shaking so badly that he could barely take Komatsuhime in his arms until several attempts were made.

        By then, Komatsuhime was already coughing out blood; her face went deadly pale. She lifted her eyes and looked at Honda, then said strenuously, ‘Dad… Dad… Cough… I… I don’t wanna die…’

        ‘No… Dear, you’re not dying! I won’t let you die!’ Tightening his embrace, Honda wanted to do something, but the only thing he could do was to watch Komatsuhime’s body go cold bit by bit in his arms.

        ‘Actually… I… I’m not afraid of death… I’m just afraid that… Dad will be lonely if I die…’ Komatsuhime lifted her hand and stroked Honda’s cheek with profound regret and tears standing in her eyes, leaving a trace of blood on his face. She then gave him a bitter smile and said, ‘I’m so sorry… Dad…to have you see me off this early…’

        As Komatsuhime breathed her last word, her hand that was stroking Honda’s face fell onto the ground. Honda, who had already broken down in tears, kept shaking his head, reluctant to accept the brutal reality. Choking up, he murmured, ‘Why… How did we end up like this?’

        ‘It’s all because of you.’ A male voice emanated from a dark corner. Honda raised his head only to see a fat man—Tokugawa—slowly walking with his hands behind his back.

        ‘You were too weak to protect your daughter so it’s your fault that your daughter died.’ As the Noh mask hanging on Tokugawa’s waist shone, a monstrous shadow quietly emerged at Honda’s back with its hands holding his head. Yet, none of that caught Honda’s unseeing eye. He just murmured in utter bewilderment, ‘It’s…my fault?’

        ‘Yeah, you killed your own daughter.’

        “He is right. If I had been more tentative, Komatsuhime wouldn’t have followed me to this island… If only I were a bit stronger, she wouldn’t have ended up like this… It’s my fault… It’s all my fault… I killed her——”

        ‘AHHHHHH——!’ As Honda let out a throaty roar, a fierce blast of wind spawned from his body. His metal arm kept expanding and contorting, forming a suit of armor that shielded his whole body.

        ‘Yes!! The perfect human weapon is finally complete!’ Seeing Honda’s change, Tokugawa cheered excitedly with his hands in the air.

        Suddenly, a rustling noise sounded, followed by a teenager coming out of the dense woods—it was Yukimura. His expression changed at the moment Komatsuhime’s body on the ground caught his attention. He rushed over to her while calling out her name frantically, ‘Komatsuhime! Komatsuhime!’

        Of course, he could not get any responses from the dead Komatsuhime. With his face ashen in misery, Yukimura held Komatsuhime’s body tightly in his arms while glaring at the smiling Tokugawa, then he asked furiously, ‘Did you kill Komatsuhime?’

        ‘Mm-hmm, I did.’ Tokugawa honestly admitted to the murder. His remorseless attitude made Yukimura’s blood boil. After putting Komatsuhime down on the ground, Yukimura drew his sword and said coldly with the sword pointing at Tokugawa, ‘I’m gonna kill you to avenge Komatsuhime’s death!’

        ‘Sadly, I’m not your opponent. He is.’ As Tokugawa snapped his fingers, Honda walked and stopped in front of Tokugawa like a puppet. Then he viciously charged at Yukimura——</p>
