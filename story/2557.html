        <h1>Impenetrable Armor - Achilles</h1>
        <p>
                Thetis, who knew her venial sinfulness, closed her eyes and waited for Giemsa’s judgment. She had no unfinished business as soon as she learned that her son, Achilles, was fine.

        Even with her eyes closed, she could feel a fierce power flying towards her. Her soul would be shattered the moment the power hit her.

        In that brief moment, Thetis’s life flashed before her eyes.

        “It’s all my fault.”

        “My son, I’m sorry…”

        “If only I had noticed…all of these…sooner… If only I had been a good mother… Would it have made everything different?”

        Just as that power was about to hit Thetis, a figure came and blocked that vicious attack.

        When Thetis opened her eyes, she saw the back of Achilles, who for the first time in forever raised his shield to protect someone instead of killing.

        Under the harsh light, Achilles stood in front of the immense power, like a madman trying to fight a huge wave with his flesh. Then the raging wave of power swallowed him, leaving countless small scratch marks on his arms.

        ‘Achilles…Why…’

        ‘Is there a reason needed for a child to protect his mother?’

        Achilles looked back and gave her a forced smile. The compelling force before him pushed him back half a step. 

        He had never felt so clear-minded ever since the Demon blood in his body had been removed by the divine power put inside him.

        Seeing the decidedly weak Thetis, Achilles felt the blood of Gods flowing in his body and soon realized what was happening to him.

        Even if this was a meaningless life;
        Even if he had to bear sins that could never be palliated—

        “I just want to protect her!”

        ‘Goddess Giemsa, I was the one who slaughtered the civilians, the one who was tainted by Demon blood, and the one who attacked the Gods. It has nothing to do with my mother! Take my soul if you want!’

        Achilles didn’t cower a bit, even though the shield in his hand gradually melted under the strong light.

        ‘Achilles!’

        Watching the two, Giemsa let out a sigh. Then the two were deluged by a sea of elements. 

        ‘Thetis, you’ve created life with divine power and attempted to interfere in the realm of humans. You’ve also taken countless lives with Achilles. And Achilles, you’ve committed innumerable murders throughout your life, in which plenty of innocent lives died because of you… To pay for your sins, you shall lose all your powers and spend the rest of your lives in the prison of Gods until eternity.’
　　
        As the light faded, Achilles and Thetis, who had lost all their powers, fell on the ground with gratitude and disbelief in their eyes.

        As long as the mother and son got to stay together, it was a happy ending, even if it cost their freedom and all their powers.</p>
