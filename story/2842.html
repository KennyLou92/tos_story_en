        <h1>Logic Demolition - Azathoth</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Prologue of the Universe - Ch.2

        From the moment Azathoth encountered Daoloth, it had been consumed by an irresistible desire to dismantle the lands of life fashioned by the other, perpetuating an unending cycle of destruction until Abhoth contrived to enfeeble it, which sparked their second encounter.

        Behind the fervent instincts of creation and destruction lay an inexorable attraction between two potent souls. Azathoth found solace in the presence of Daoloth, and the latter could not restrain its yearning to comprehend the other’s desire. Thus, the manifestations of two extremes attempted to intertwine. Still, everything proved futile in punctuating the impending degradation of creation.

        As the affection for Daoloth sprouted within Azathoth, it could not bear the prospect of its beloved’s demise. With the aid of Yipp, it later discovered the twisted cause of Daoloth’s plight—a high-dimensional force that expedites evolution and elimination of inferior species. As one of the chosen ones, Daoloth yet failed in its evolutionary ascent, and thus befallen by an inevitable doom.

        In its endeavor to save Daoloth, Azathoth departed from its beloved, embarking on a quest alongside Yibb to seek Ubbo the creator. Long ago, Ubbo devoured the essence of Fthaggua the destroyer, whose fragmented soul and powers remained within Ubbo’s vessel. Its powers that transcended dimensions were essential to extract the instinct of creation from Daoloth.

        Recognizing the shared goal of saving Daoloth, Ubbo agreed to join forces with Azathoth. Under Yibb’s tutelage, Ubbo learned to harness the powers of Fthaggua and control its mighty forces. Meanwhile, Azathoth focused on collecting the power of constellations which would be instrumental in dismantling the instinct of creation.

        Under Ubbo’s relentless efforts, it soon mastered the powers of Fthaggua. Azathoth, on the other hand, gathered an abundance of stellar power. With their preparations complete, the determined party decided to carry out their plan——

        “Destroy it now!” Exerting its last ounce of strength, Ubbo hurled the instinct of creation toward Azathoth and Yibb, and then, it plummeted into the depths of the cosmos as its body reached the point of exhaustion.

        Yibb surged forward to catch hold of the instinct of creation—a swirling, iridescent mass that defied comprehension. With its true nature obscured by its existence in higher realms, beings of the lower dimensions could only perceive its amorphous and elusive form.

        Sensing the imminent threat, the shapeless iridescence struggled desperately to return to its host. It took every ounce of Yibb’s strength to prevent its escape.

        “Azathoth, this is what caused Daoloth’s distortion and collapse. Ubbo has severed its connection with Daoloth perfectly, leaving no trace of its influence. However, it must be annihilated now, for it will stop at nothing to return to Daoloth’s body!”

        “Damn it! I won’t let it do so! I will destroy it completely!” Azathoth roared in furious defiance, tearing its own body asunder.

        A transcendent power arose from the depths of destructive chaos, birthing multiple radiant celestial bodies. It was the power of constellations amassed by Azathoth, who had planted the seeds of the stars within its body and nurtured them with its formidable might. Now, each seed pulsated with an abundance of destructive force.

        As Azathoth raised its draconic claws, the seeds gathered within its grasp coalesced into a scintillating, obsidian spear. Bristled with shimmering silver plasma, it unleashed a devastating power that caused the entire universe to tremble in its wake.

        “What a revolting alien force! Be gone!” With its gaze fixed upon the writhing aberrant iridescence, Azathoth swung the spear formed by the celestial bodies. Strangely, it stopped just before striking its target. Azathoth sensed a vital essence, more significant than the power it wielded, slipping away incessantly. A sense of powerlessness swept through Azathoth, causing it to lose its grip on the power of constellations. The spear slipped from its claws and floated aimlessly amid the cosmic expanse.

        “Azathoth, what’s wrong?” Yibb, perceiving the disturbance, approached Azathoth, only to witness an exceedingly delicate thread of gold and silver entwining around the latter’s body.

        “Aha, it seems I’ve made it.” A headless mass of flesh the size of a fingernail wriggled forward from the other end of the thread. It was Y’golonac, one of the followers of destruction, who managed to reach Azathoth unnoticed with its minuscule form. Reveling in the fulfillment of its scheme, it gave out a sardonic chuckle.

        Upon witnessing the scene, Yibb immediately commanded Y’golonac, shouting, “Y’go! Untie the thread at once!”

        “Huh? After all the effort I put into this, why would I possibly untie it?”

        “What do you want?”

        “Destruction, of course! I want to dismantle the very fabric of creation and destruction, breaking the rules that govern this world!”

        Rarely succumbing to anger, Yibb was about to charge forward and slay Y’golonac but a shadow lunged from behind, toppling Yibb to the ground with such a brute force that caused Yibb to lose its grip on the instinct of creation.

        The contorted iridescence slipped from Yibb’s grasp. Yibb vigorously shook off the figure on its back, attempting to retrieve the alien force, but the latter intercepted it again, revealing its true form—a reptilian creature with numerous arms and orifices.

        “What are you? Beat it!” Yibb questioned in fury.

        “I am Mordiggian, the one who shall replace Azathoth!” said Mordiggian, an inferior by-product of Daoloth’s creation of Tarones. It accidentally caught a glimpse of Daoloth’s true form, which sparked an intense sense of self within it and an ambition to rise to Daoloth’s status. For that purpose, it did not hesitate to consume the remnants of Arwassa, a follower of creation, to be rid of its inferior soul.

        Later, Mordiggian hunted and murdered Y’golonac when it arrived on the Tarones. After assimilating Y’golonac, Mordiggian learned of its deepest desires and decided to conspire with each other, plotting to disrupt the universe’s fate.

        “Preposterous!”

        “I think we should let the results speak for themselves!” Not wasting another second more, Mordiggian joined forces with Y’golonac to corner Yibb. Their interception prevented Yibb from reclaiming the twisted iridescence, allowing the alien force to swim back to Daoloth, who lay motionless on the side.

        Bound by the thread of causality, Azathoth could only watch as the alien force, which had long tormented Daoloth, tried to burrow itself back into the love of its life again.

        The mere thought of the alien force infiltrating Daoloth’s body and parasitizing its heart  devastated Azathoth. Its wrath became uncontainable, followed by a dimension-shaking roar that echoed around the cosmos with despair and terror.

        “Damn it! Damn it! DAMN IT! Daoloth is mine! Its flesh, its mind, its soul—all of it belongs to me! No one shall defile it! No one shall harm it!” Azathoth screamed out its deepest longing. It struggled in desperation, even as the thread of causality distorted its body and viscous fluid oozed from its broken scales.

        However, no matter how hard Azathoth tried, it failed to break free from the thread of causality. For the thread did not serve as a physical shackle but rather a restraint upon its soul. Nevertheless, Azathoth did not give up. Its desire to save Daoloth had surpassed any frustrations and despair.

        “Daoloth… The fragment of my soul… The only treasure I yearn to guard… Only Daoloth possesses the power to grant me solace. If the toll of misfortune is what I have to pay to save it, then I shall willingly bear the weightiest shackles and venture into the prison known as madness.”

        As Azathoth ignited its soul, its powers transcended the restraint of the thread of causality, creating a miracle that defied destiny’s hold.

        With a dissonant sound, Azathoth forcefully broke free from the thread of causality. Disregarding the agony of backlash, it mustered its powers. Its flesh began to multiply, its wings elongating and spreading in all directions until they shrouded vast swaths of the universe and stopped the instinct of creation that sought refuge within Daoloth’s body.

        Azathoth folded its wings, stirring a storm that carried the instinct of creation to its mouth. Then, it opened its maw—

        Gulp.

        Azathoth swallowed the instinct of creation in one gulp and sealed its mouth shut. Finding no escape, the instinct of creation could only slide down Azathoth’s throat and parasitize its heart. However, the alien force’s intrusion provoked the high-dimensional power fused within Azathoth itself. The instincts started a violent rampage, inflicting tortures capable of shattering both one’s reason and soul upon Azathoth.

        “ARGHHHHHH—!”

        Azathoth became the epicenter of madness, the wellspring of power, disturbing the tranquility of the cosmos. An avaricious chaos spread throughout its entire being, throwing its will into disarray. The desire for destruction consumed its soul. Azathoth knew clearly that it was about to step into the cage called madness, as it had anticipated. Yet, it harbored no fear nor anger, but only one, the most devout, wish—

        “Daoloth, the other half of my soul, please partake in the misfortune that befalls me and let miracles carry you beyond the shores of liberation, freed from the shackles that bind you.”</p>
