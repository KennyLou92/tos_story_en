        <h1>Conqueror’s Heart - Baal</h1>
        <p>
                In an extravagant mansion, over a dozen immaculately dressed demons gathered in the spacious hall, all respectfully gazing up at the robust man seated on the throne—Baal, the king of protodemons, who was idly toying with the dazzling golden pendant hanging from his neck. Even in his relaxed demeanor, he still exuded an undeniably imposing aura. The demons cowered involuntarily and held their breaths, lest they make the slightest sound.

        Before the demons would suffocate in the stifling atmosphere, Baal finally spoke, “So, none of you have found Belial.”

        Ever since ascending to the throne, Baal had taken it upon himself to deal with his brother, Belial, who was sent to explore the continent of Tarones. With the assistance of nobles, including Mastema, he managed to capture Belial and dismantle his forces. However, Belial’s loyal subordinate, Azazel, defended him at all costs, allowing them to escape Baal’s grasp.

        Baal, of course, had no intention of setting Belial free, thus he gave an order to his soldiers to pursue them. Yet, the news they had brought was far from satisfactory, which left him in great displeasure.

        Despite Baal’s languid tone, his words cut through the demons’ hearts like a sharp blade. Surprisingly, an elderly demon gritted his teeth and mustered the courage to respond, “Yes, Your Majesty, we are truly sorry. We have mobilized all demons to search for Prince Belial, but we still couldn’t find him.”

        “No, it’s not that you can’t find him,” Baal said.

        “Huh?” Baal’s words threw the demon into confusion. With a soft sigh, Baal displayed rare patience as he explained, “They were severely injured, and still, we failed to find them with all our manpower. Clearly, someone has been sheltering them. Get it?”

        “Ye-yes, I understand!”

        “Then go and search again,” commanded Baal with a wave of his hand. One by one, the demons left the hall. Seeing the relieved expression on their faces, Baal felt a sense of dreariness wash over him. 

        ‘Sigh, why are there so many fools in this world…’ Baal sighed inwardly. His face slightly lightened as he touched the golden pendant, ‘Fortunately, I still have him, only he can ignite my desire for conquest.’

        Following his heart, Baal walked to the far end of the corridor where he pushed open the door to a room, only to find it empty. He thought, ‘He’s not here… He must have gone there again.’

        Baal swiftly turned around, heading to the garden outside the mansion until he arrived at a glass greenhouse. A wave of intense floral fragrance filled his nostrils as soon as he pushed open the door. In the middle of blooming flowers was a person-sized crimson cocoon, where a slender figure, curled up like a newborn child, could be seen through the opening.

        “I knew you’d be sleeping here again, Laplace,” Baal murmured as he extended his fingers to caress Laplace’s smooth cheek.

        Sensing the familiar scent, the slumbering Laplace unconsciously nuzzled Baal’s hand with his face while calling out the name of the existence that had once caused his heartache with infinite adoration, “Vorvadoss… Don’t leave me…”

        However, Laplace’s unconscious cry triggered a change in Baal’s expression. The tenderness and affection on his face switched to a fierce look of bitter resentment as he tightened his grip on Laplace’s face.

        “Mmm!” The pain woke Laplace from his dream. When he opened his eyes and found it was Baal, a faint hint of disappointment flickered across his gaze, which Baal, who had been watching Laplace intently, did not miss, no matter how unnoticeable it was. Laplace’s reaction only intensified the jealousy and anger that surged within him.

        ‘Why… After all these years, why do you still cling to that ephemeral ghost of the past? I’m standing right in front of you, but why won’t you look at me?’ Baal stared at Laplace expressionlessly. Suddenly, a ridiculous idea sprouted in his mind. ‘If I can’t win you with my true heart, then I shall do it the other way.’

        Baal quietly gathered power in his other hand. Taking advantage of Laplace’s momentary grogginess, he extended his hand toward the center of Laplace’s forehead—

        SLAP! Laplace forcefully slapped Baal’s hand away, staring at him in disbelief as he exclaimed, “What were you doing? Did you just try to erase my memories with magic?”

        “...Well, since he’s always causing you pain, wouldn’t it be better to tackle the problem at its root?” asked Baal under a nonchalant pretense while gently holding his right hand which had swollen up from Laplace’s strike.

        “Even if Vorvadoss causes me pain, it’s not for you to decide!”

        Laplace’s words left Baal stunned for a moment, but he quickly regained his composure. Self-mockingly, he retorted, “Right, I got carried away. I forgot that we were just playing a game, no strings attached. Worry not. I won’t overstep the boundaries again and it won’t affect our plans.”

        Baal took a step back. When he looked up at Laplace, the swirling affection and obsession in his eyes had disappeared, replaced by his usual cold and indifferent gaze.

        “You…” The sudden change in Baal’s attitude made Laplace fluster. He hastily stepped out of the cocoon and walked up to Baal. He stood on his toes to plant a soft kiss on his lips. However, Baal turned his face to the side and avoided the kiss. Embarrassed, Laplace hysterically yelled, “Why did you avoid me? Wasn’t that what you’ve always wanted?”

        “Not anymore. I can never win your heart as long as you refuse to forget him. So, I give up.”

        Baal pushed Laplace away. Paying no attention to the latter’s reaction, he resolutely walked away. Yet, contrary to his ruthless action, a violent storm of emotions erupted within him with a dreadfully twisted sense of possessiveness churning inside his mind. It was not until he gave in to his impulse and slayed the demon soldiers in halves when they came to report to him that he finally calmed down.

        Covered in fresh blood, Baal made his way back to his bedroom. Every demon soldier along the way either bowed their head or avoided him as they sensed the king’s anger.

        However, Baal sensed something amiss as soon as he stepped into his room. He heard a barely audible sound of breathing, but he played pretense and walked toward the wardrobe to take out some clean clothes instead. Suddenly, he flung the clothes toward the source of the sound. Quick as a speeding arrow, he accurately seized the hidden intruder by the neck with his right hand.

        “I knew it was you, my dear brother,” Baal teased softly with a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth.

        Just then, moonlight streamed into the bedroom through the window, revealing the intruder’s face that bore some resemblance to Baal. It was Belial, whose expression turned cold as he said. “Don’t call me like that. It’s disgusting— Argh!”

        Baal tightened his grip on Belial’s neck. Baliel painfully struggled to break free, but none of his attempts managed to shake Baal, not even a bit. Watching his little brother’s desperate struggles brought Baal a sense of satisfaction, thus he taunted, “You know well that you’re no match for me, and still, you dare to resist me. What a fool… Mm!”

        Suddenly, a wave of intense dizziness swept over Baal, forcing him to release his hold on Belial’s neck.

        “It’s finally working,” said Beliao with a triumphant smile. “The poison crafted from the corrosive venom of the Dragon of Poison is truly remarkable.”

        “So you’ve coated your neck with poison… Heh, not bad. It’s a rarely brilliant move for you,” Baal remarked.

        ‘So, it’s the Dragon of Poison. No wonder I can’t withstand it. But, I can neutralize this deadly poison if I use his power, his power to observe the truths of everything,’ Baal thought, raising his hand to touch the golden pendant on his neck. Just as he was about to infuse his powers into it, Laplace’s face and that hint of disappointment in his eyes flashed across his mind. As the destructively possessive desire within him began to burn again, his thoughts spun rapidly and ultimately led to a reckless decision.

        ‘I will make a bet. Let’s see how much I actually mean to him.’ And so, Baal loosened his grip on the pendant, allowing the venom to spread throughout his body. Through his blurred vision, he saw Belial walk toward him and roughly grab his hair, the same way he had done to his young brother in the mansion in the past.

        “Fear not, my pompous brother. I won’t kill you now, not until I expose your true colors before everyone!” Belial laughed maniacally, his laughter filled with madness and arrogance.

        Baal had no interest in Belial’s victorious speech. He gazed through the window in the direction of the faraway garden. His thoughts scattered due to the venom, and still, the restless emotions and desires within his heart continued to burn.

        ‘Laplace, if it means risking my life to win your heart, then I shall gladly do so. For only by paying the highest price can I savor the most delicious fruit, one that I could never resist.’
