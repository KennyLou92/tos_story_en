        <h1>All For One</h1>
        <p>
        The “Great Evil” that once reigned over the city as the vile ruler. He took a back seat as he was severely injured after his mortal combat with All Might 6 years ago. Choosing Shigaraki as his successor, he was secretly on the move as the adviser of the League of Villains. His quirk allows him to steal other people's Quirks and wield the Quirks as his own. He can also redistribute his stolen Quirks to other people. Meanwhile, he is able to manipulate multiple Quirks at the same time.</p>
