        <h1>Edward Elric</h1>
        <p>State Alchemist with the alias "Fullmetal".

A boy with characteristic features - blonde, golden eyes, red coat, automails on his right arm and left leg, all on a small frame. He has a natural talent for alchemy, being the youngest ever to obtain a state certification at the age of 12. 

He lost his left leg from performing the taboo of human transmutation in the past. He then lost his right arm in the transmutation of his little brother's soul right afterwards. 

In order to regain his original body, he has been traveling through various lands with his little brother Alphonse Elric in search of the legendary "Philosopher's Stone." But after learning the fearful secrets behind the Philosopher's Stone, he has been in search of an alternative method.

Unlike other alchemists, he can transmute items without a transmutation circle. In battle, he utilizes his automail on his right arm by turning it into a dagger and combines the weapon with his martial arts skills. Personality-wise, he is passionate and somewhat impulsive, and enrages to a point where he can't see his surroundings when those close to him are facing danger. 

He has an inferiority complex about his short stature, so using words like "bean" "tiny" â€œsmall" around him are no-go. But, he still hates milk.
