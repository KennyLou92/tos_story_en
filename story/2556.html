        <h1>Mighty Oceanic Axe - Beowulf</h1>
        <p>        Scrubia found Beowulf. When she saw him kneel in pain in front of a strange woman, she thought the woman was the one who caused his pain so she wanted to knock down the assailant first before any tragedy happened. Much to her surprise, Beowulf stood and protected the woman. Then his mind collapsed again with tears of blood falling from his eyes.

        Feeling his cracking soul, Scrubia rushed to hold him in her arms, regardless of the danger of being attacked. She conjured all her powers and channeled them into the trembling body of Beowulf like the tenderest flow of warmth.

        “Dragon soul, please protect the one I love.” The dragon soul released an indigo light and fell on the two like a soundless shower of rain as it felt Scrubia’s urge…

        Beowulf, whose soul was to be crushed by the overflow of information, felt a clear stream of power cascade through his body while lifting his battered soul and washing away the turmoil in his head. In a moment, all the peaceful and good memories flooded back and occupied his mind——

        During his journey, he crossed a river with someone’s hand in his, someone who snuggled up to him after waking up from a nightmare, and his fingers would run through her fine and smooth hair… Those were the memories between Scrubia and him. 

        Opening his eyes, Beowulf finally awakened from the unknown chaos. Feebly, he lifted his right and stroked Scrubia’s cheek, with loving tenderness that he had never shown before. Then, he whispered, ‘Now I remember… I’m Beowulf, the dragonslayer who once fought for glory… but now, I’m a warrior who fights to protect you…’

        ‘Yes, you’re my one and only hero.’ Scrubia smiled lightly with tears filling her eyes. At that moment, no words were needed for they already knew each other’s thoughts under the resonance of power. The affection that they had kept in their hearts through years of companionship was now brought to the light.

        ‘What a surprise that you made it through the breakdown.’ The woman’s voice burst the loving bubble between them. As the two came back to their minds, they both looked at the woman alarmingly and Beowulf asked, ‘Who…are you?’

        ‘It doesn’t matter who I am. You just have to know that my encounter with you is an inevitable result of fate.’ Closing her eyes, the woman raised her wand, then a magic circle sprung up in the air.

        Soon, Beowulf and Scrubia felt that the power of the dragon soul was drawn out from them. The light released from their bodies gathered into a ball of light in the magic circle. Powerless to stop that, the two eventually fell on their knees for the lack of strength.

        ‘You…Did you take away our dragon soul?’ With her hands clasping her hair, Scrubia tried to channel her powers yet she could not turn it into a pair of wings again. 

        ‘Yes, but more precisely, I took the remnant soul in his body. The power you had was just a part of it.’

        ‘...Why did you help us?’ Scrubia still couldn’t believe her eyes that the nightmare that had been haunting them for years was resolved so easily in a short time.

        ‘I didn’t help you. I just took something that didn’t belong to you. Now, you’re on your own with your fate.’ Leaving these words, the woman no longer stayed and walked into the woods with the ball of light and quick steps.

        After watching her figure disappear into the woods, Beowulf and Scrubia stood up and headed back to the village.

        For they finally got their wish after all these years of traveling, Beowulf was flummoxed that he didn’t know what they should do next; whereas Scrubia deliberately leaned against him and said, ‘I just want to keep creating new memories with you, no matter where our destination is.’</p>
