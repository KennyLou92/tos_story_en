        <h1>Nobunaga the Blistering Samurai</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 6

        Nobunaga and Nohime the cool beauty struggled to survive on the island full of mad men and danger. On their journey for survival, they ran into Hideyoshi, a young man, and Akechi, a friend of Nobunaga.

        And so, the four continued their journey as a group. Unexpectedly, they encountered Honda, a man who attacked them straightaway and knocked Hideyoshi and Akechi out. Seeing themselves at a disadvantage, Nobunaga and Nohime decisively retreated.

        Fortunately, they managed to elude Honda’s pursuit and took Hideyoshi and Akechi to a safe cave through collaborative efforts. Doubtful about Honda’s abnormal behavior, Nohime went to follow him alone, leaving the injured Nobunaga in the cave to rest.

        However, little did Nobunaga expect that Akechi would try to kill him while he was asleep. Although Hideyoshi killed Akechi and saved Nobunaga, the wound that Akechi left him still led to his demise. After Nobunaga had buried the two of them, he went to find Nohime, who had not come back to the cave since then. He followed the marks that Nohime had left and managed to locate her, only to find her barely breathing.

        As Nohime recounted what had happened, Nobunaga learned that she was injured by the demented Honda, who was controlled by Tokugawa, the mastermind behind everything, and Tokugawa was planning to activate a magic circle at the cost of the lives of other survivors on the island.

        So as to stop Tokugawa’s ambitious plan, Nobunaga left the wounded Nohime and went to the lake house alone. From the eerie light that flickered on the rooftop, Nobunaga could tell that it was where the magic circle was, so he swiftly sneaked into the house and came to the rooftop terrace after avoiding various traps.

        The moment he set foot on the terrace, he saw a glowing red magic circle, with Honda sitting in the center, whose body was wrapped in the red ribbons coming out from the circle.

        “So this is the magic circle. Let me break it now!” Soon after Nobunaga drew his katana, he jumped and slashed it hard at the magic circle——

        Clank——! It was the sound of weapons clashing. A black shadow blocked Nobunaga’s full-strength blow in mid-air; sparks flew as the two swords crossed. Simultaneously, Nobunaga and his opponent did not continue their attacks after they had landed on the ground.

        Despite the white Noh mask on his opponent’s face, Nobunaga still recognized who the man was by the clan emblem on his clothes.

        “He’s Shingen of the Takeda family… I thought he went missing. Why is he here?” Nobunaga felt bewildered, yet a man came out before he could sort out the puzzle—it was Tokugawa.

        ‘You guys are so annoying. But never mind, I’ll be the bigger person and forgive you. I can tell him to spare your life if you leave now.’

        ‘Ha, funny. I will still be dead if you activate that magic circle. Don’t pull that trick on me as if I’m a three-year-old.’

        ‘Oh well, then let’s finish this in an adult way!’ As soon as Tokugawa put his hand on the Noh mask on his waist and shouted lowly, Shingen charged at Nobunaga, raising his katana to slash.

        Nobunaga dodged Shingen’s katana with a bend of his knees and a twist of his body. As he made a stride to the left and spun, he then thrust his katana into Shingen’s left chest from the rear before the latter could resume his stance.

        To Nobunaga’s surprise, there was not a single drop of blood seen on Shingen even though a sword bored through his heart. Sensing the unusualness, Nobunaga immediately retracted his katana and leaped backward, narrowly avoiding Shingen’s full-strength kick.

        ‘What… How can he still move?!’

        ‘That’s because he’s dead.’ Tokugawa gave a derisive snort and said, ‘I can turn the dead into zombies and make them my puppet while keeping the powers they had in their former lives. Now go!’

        Tokugawa put his hand on the mask on his waist again. A flash of silver light flickered across the mask on Shingen’s face as though it was responding to Tokugawa. The next moment, Shingen charged at Nobunaga like a shooting arrow with even more adroit moves than before.

        Nobunaga raised his katana to parry the attack. The moment their weapons clashed, Nobunaga could feel tingles that numbed both his arms, and thus he realized that his opponent’s power had grown stronger. So instead of fighting Shingen head-on, Nobunaga pulled back his katana and chose to avoid Shingen’s wave of attacks while observing the latter and Tokugawa, whose movements soon confirmed his surmise.

        “The mask on Shingen’s face reacts whenever Tokugawa touches the one on his waist… He must be controlling Shingen with that mask! Maybe I can stop Shingen if I destroy it.” As soon as Nobunaga had found the solution, he no longer dodged Shingen’s attacks but raised his katana and charged at the latter.

        Nobunaga’s unexpected attack stunned Shingen and caught him off guard. Just when the tip of Nobunaga’s katana was about to pry the mask off Shingen’s face, an immense tremor of fear shot through his right body, urging him to instinctively withdraw his katana and hold his guard to the right——

        Clank! A bullet hit Nobunaga’s katana and was split in half. A sharp pain began shortly after one of them whistled past his arm and left a searing wound. Yet, Nobunaga gritted his teeth and endured the pain. Then he jumped sideways, dropping his katana.

        A man with a Noh mask walked to the side of Shingen from a dark corner. There was smoke coming out from the gun in his hand. Tokugawa, who had watched everything from the back, could not help but chuckle as he saw the embarrassing look on Nobunaga’s face, and he said, ‘Haha, I never said that I only have one zombie.’

        ‘Don’t gloat just yet. That doesn’t mean you’ll win even if you outnumber me.’ Still, Nobunaga showed no sign of frustration even in the face of such a predicament; his eyes were still blazing bright like the stars.

        “I’m not gonna die. How could I possibly die here? So please help me!” Nobunaga held his hairpin so tightly that it cut through the skin of his palm. Blood oozed and turned into scorching flames. The hairpin then split into two in the flaring firelight and transformed into two flaming scarlet katanas in his hands.

        Sensing the crisis, Tokugawa pressed the Noh mask on his waist and channeled his energy into it. Bursts of strong light emerged on the Noh masks on the two zombies and enhanced their strength.

        At a snap of Tokugawa’s fingers, the two zombies closed in on Nobunaga from the sides while holding their weapons up high to attack. However, Nobunaga melted all their attacks with the flames on his katanas.

        Nobunaga lifted and swung his sword before the two zombies could launch another wave of attacks. After two neat swishes, their masks fell off and so did their bodies.

        Yet, that was not the end—Nobunaga passed the katana from his left hand to his right while picking up the gun on the ground. Then, he aimed it at Tokugawa in a blink and resolutely pulled the trigger——

        Bang!

        A figure jumped out of the dark and stood in front of Tokugawa. A crimson flower of blood bloomed as the bullet thudded into his chest, indelibly seared into Tokugawa’s widened eyes like a permanent scar一

        ‘Hattori——!’ Tokugawa let out a hysterical scream as though a dagger had been plunged deep into his heart.</p>
