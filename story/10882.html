        <h1>The Farewell Waltz - Chopin</h1>
        <p>Sheets of paper were scattered into the air. The icy grip of humiliation tightened around the heart of Chopin—the very composer of the sheet music—like a bitter blizzard.

        “Chopin, WHAT is this nonsense?” Bach, the man who had hurled the pages into the air, furrowed his brow and questioned.

        “...We need change,” Chopin said, raising his head to meet Bach’s gaze directly. He remained calm and composed despite the conductor’s insulting remarks. Still, his tightly clenched fists betrayed his true emotion. His voice, however, was steady as he explained, “Our music has become stagnant in its style. We will lose all our possibilities one day if we don’t make changes…”

        “We don’t need change,” Bach interjected rigidly, his voice leaving no room for negotiation. “Change is merely an excuse to disrupt harmony. Carrying forward our ancestors’ music is the essential principle of our orchestra and it should never be compromised.”

        “…I understand.” Chopin did not argue further because he knew it would only be a fruitless discussion.

        Always do the right thing at the right time in the right way, and never cross the line—this had been Chopin’s way of conducting himself. It was his philosophy of living.

        Therefore, instead of firing back with venom-laced retorts at Bach’s negation, Chopin calmly bent down to pick up the scattered pages—the sheets of music he had spent the entire spring composing—on the floor one by one.

        “My apologies for wasting your time, Conductor. I shall take my leave now.” Chopin bowed courteously to Bach before walking away. The moment he turned his back against the conductor, the mask of composure shattered, revealing an unrestrained ambition and a burning desire that distorted his attractive features.

        ‘I knew it… True reform must come with pain and upheaval…’ Chopin thought, lifting his gaze toward the darkened sky. A determined smile tugged at the corner of his mouth. ‘Then let me be the one to sound the death knell.’</p>
