        <h1>Dignified Ridge - Gram</h1>
        <p>Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 4

        As the first light of dawn broke, casting a gentle hue on the sprawling hills of blooming flowers, the world awoke in a kaleidoscope of colors. At the end of the hills stood a colossal sword of unparalleled grandeur, embedded firmly in the unyielding earth, excluding an aura of solemn dominance that inspired reverence among all who beheld it. It was a place known as the Gladiospire Vale, the sanctuary of the gladiospinas, the dragons of swords.

        Whenever there was a ceremony or celebration, the dragons would soar across the sky and gather at the sanctuary, filling the place with bustling energy. Yet, at the moment, at the break of dawn when the world had just awakened in the pleasant breeze, the Gladiospire Vale was rather tranquil and peaceful.

        A dragon flew from afar, quietly descending at the entrance of Gladiospire Vale, as if he was afraid to disturb someone. With a bouquet of white flowers clasped in his mouth, he slowly made his way toward the majestic sword before which a gladiospina, prostrating with devotion, uttering a sincere prayer with his eyes closed.

        “Father,” the dragon whispered, placing the bouquet on the ground. Tyrfing, the gladiospina before the colossal sword, opened his eyes and straightened his body, revealing a formidable presence that befitted his position as the gladiospinas’ leader.

        “Gram,” Tyrfing greeted his son with a calm voice and then relapsed into silence, allowing the conversation to fade away.

        Gram, who had long grown accustomed to his father’s taciturn nature, took it upon himself to speak up, “I’ve come to offer my prayers for Mother as well.”

        Gram’s mother, Mistilteinn, had gone out years ago, and she never returned. Despite Tyrfing’s numerous search efforts with his subordinates, no trace or information about Mistilteinn had been found.

        Many gladiospinas believed Mistilteinn had gone for good, and even Gram ceased to hold onto hope. Meanwhile, as the leader of the gladiospinas, Tyrfing could not abandon his responsibilities and left his people to search for his wife. Thus, he visited the Gladiospire Vale every day to pray for her, undeterred by rain or storms.

        “Yes, that’s good. She’ll know,” Tyrfing replied.

        After Gram put the bouquet next to the colossal sword, he stepped back to his father’s side. Together, they gazed at the clear, azure sky, so bright and peaceful. Yet, Gram knew the peaceful days would soon be shattered.

        “The runedragons, tuxias, and celts have all agreed to fight against the beasts,” Gram spoke.

        “That’s for the best. The beasts have grown too audacious in recent years. It’s time to put an end to their rampage,” Tyrfing remarked.

        “Vatican will surely lead everyone into action before long. However, with each race’s distinct character and convictions, uniting them will not be an easy task,” Gram commented.

        “It won’t be a problem with Vatican’s powers,” Tyrfing praised in a tone of rare appreciation, “You fought against him before, and you should know better than I do.”

        “Indeed, his powers far surpass mine,” Gram nodded in agreement, and continued, “Vatican should be able to convince everyone to subdue those savage beasts.” Yet, his complimentary remarks soon turned into a sigh, “We all thought it was merely a small dispute between the beasts and the elves, who knows things would spiral into something far worse…”

        Several years ago, the phantocaudas suspected the neighboring elves of plotting an alliance with other clans to invade their territory. Under the pretense of defending their homeland, the phantocaudas launched a preemptive attack against the elves. The surviving elves, filled with resentment, rallied their forces from other friendly elf clans for retaliation. Unexpectedly, some treacherous elves took advantage of the chaos to launch attacks on other beast clans and escalate the conflict into a war.

        As time passed, the belligerent beasts grew increasingly fierce in battles, unleashing their latent aggression and brutality. Their heinous slaughter fueled hatred in their victims, and eventually, the other races and clans decided to take action and unite against them. The gladiospinas were one of the dragon clans that volunteered to help the elves, which was also why many of them had fallen in the past few years.

        “Therefore, to ensure lasting peace among the seven races, we need a leader,” Tyrfing stated.

        “Father, are you referring to the Heptara Unies—”

        However, a sudden shout from the sky interrupted Gram before he could finish his sentence.

        “Chief Tyrfing! The floral-elves, they are under attack by the phantocaudas!” A soldier frantically delivered the message.

        “Gram, take the vanguard team to protect the floral-elves. Remember, your top priority is to rescue them, so avoid engaging in a fight with the phantocaudas,” Tyrfing swiftly issued his command.

        “Yes, Father!” Gram responded with veneration. Although his father was emotionally reserved, he could feel his father’s love and held great respect for him, so he wholeheartedly believed and obeyed his father’s decisions and orders.

        Gram quickly made the necessary preparations and led the vanguard team toward the forest where the floral-elves were attacked. However, before reaching the heart of the battlefield, they came across a scene of devastation: the ground was littered with elves’ corpses, with one particular path filled with gruesomely murdered ones whose faces were still etched with terror and despair.

        ‘This is outrageous. It’s no longer just a matter of slaughter; it’s a heinous crime! I must stop that beast!’ Gram’s face turned cold as he thought. Following the trail of corpses, he flew toward the center of the carnage and witnessed the culprit—a gleeful phantocauda reveling in its ruthless killing spree.

        Instead of interfering right away, Gram remained silent and decisively channeled his powers into the core sword on his back. The core sword was not only the lethal weapon of a gladiospina but also their weakness. If the core sword is destroyed, the gladiospina will be left devoid of will, reduced to a mere shell, a walking corpse.

        It was because of such stringent constraints, the core swords granted the gladiospinas indomitable powers. And so, Gram unleashed his core sword, shooting it toward the bloodthirsty phantocauda with imposing momentum.

        However, another beast pushed the phantocauda away before Gram’s strike could land, saving his life and whisking him away.

        Gram, who remembered his father’s command to prioritize rescuing the floral-elves in distress, did not pursue the beasts. Instead, he and his team split up and assumed their human forms for an easier and more efficient search.

        Gram walked through the sap-splattered forest, wielding his sword and searching for any surviving elves amidst corpses. Yet, something peculiar about the wounds on the corpses left him puzzled.

        ‘Why do their injuries resemble sword wounds? They don’t seem like something left by the phantocaudas’ attacks…’ An inexplicable unease crept upon Gram. It was not until he heard a faint scraping sound from the forest that he snapped back to attention.

        Gram turned around and chased after the source of the sound. After a short moment of hide-and-seek, he managed to catch the figure—a young, petite floral-elf named Lilac.

        “Pl-please! Don’t kill me!” shouted Lilac, refusing to surrender. She thrashed and struggled, nearly slipping from Gram’s grasp, and that left him no choice but to assume his dragon form and hold her in place with his claws. At the same time, he explained, “I’m a gladiospina! I’m here to help you! So please calm down!”

        “A gladiospina?” Staring at the magnificent dragon, Lilac was convinced by Gram’s words. Still, she questioned with a hint of suspicion, “But why do you and that girl look so alike?”

        “What are you talking about?” A high-pitched ringing pierced Gram’s ears, drowning out all other sounds. The unsettling premonition that had plagued him earlier surged once again as he recalled the familiar sword wounds on the elves’ corpses.

        “...Your human form looked similar to the girl who slaughtered our kin earlier,” Lilac hesitated before speaking up, “That’s why I thought you were one of them when you came.”

        “Was that girl wielding a large sword?” Gram transformed back into his human form and raised his core sword which was now smaller in his hand, and asked, “Just like this one?”

        “Yes, yes! She was so petite but she looked effortless when she wielded that sword. Oh! Right!” Lilac took a bracelet out of her pocket and handed it to Gram as she said, “Also, she dropped this bracelet. Maybe it holds some clues about her.”

        Gram took the bracelet and examined it closely. It was a worn red string threaded with a dark green gemstone engraved with a shakily handwritten name: Joan.

        ‘I’ve seen this stone before… It was a gift Father gave Mother… But there wasn’t a name engraved on it back then…’ Gram pondered.

        “How is it? Did you find any clue?” Lilac asked curiously, but the astonishing truth had blown Gram away and drowned out her voice.

        ‘So, that girl is related to Mother…But why would she help the phantocaudas in eradicating the elves… What on earth is going on…’

        With the bracelet in his hand, Gram clenched his fist, his expression grave and determined as he silently vowed, ‘I must find out the truth!’</p>
