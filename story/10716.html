        <h1>Luminous Predator - Zoar</h1>
        <p>
        Wrathful Horizon - Ch. 6

        In the main chamber of a cavern, a dozen colossal beasts gathered, their gazes fixed on a dominant beast with two tails, one of which bore a visible dueling scar. The beast’s name was Admah, one of the mightiest warriors among the phantocaudas.

        By Admah’s side was his little sister, Zoar, a three-tailed phantocauda. Overshadowed by her brother’s imposing presence, she quietly observed as their comrades passionately expressed their grievances.

        “Those wretched gladiospinas!” an elder phantocauda bellowed, “They’ve ruined our plans time and time again! We can’t let this happen again, or it will soil our clan’s reputation!”

        “They’re really a painful thorn in the flesh,” a younger phantocauda concurred, “Perhaps we should join forces with other beast clans to defeat them!”

        “I know the corrodents and barrenonts have long harbored contempt for those haughty dragons. They will surely support us,” the other phantocaudas nodded in agreement, charging the atmosphere with heat.

        “That would be too reckless,” Zoar finally spoke up upon hearing their imprudent plan, “We can’t afford to antagonize another race when we’re already at odds with the elves. That will only leave us in a more disadvantageous position. Besides, Gomorrah warned us against engaging in direct confrontation with the gladiospinas.”

        “Humph! Just because she’s the cheiftain doesn’t mean she can do whatever she wants and disregard our voices,” Admah sneers, glancing at Zoar, his gaze sharp and piercing, “That is why I’m going to propose a plan to exterminate the gladiospinas at our next strategy meeting. Even the chieftain can’t veto our plan as long as we have the majority support.”

        “Yes! Admah is right!”
        “Gomorrah can’t ignore our voices!”
        “We must stand up for ourselves!”

        Looking at the beasts’ cacophony, Zoar realized that she could not change their minds, so she could only silently watch them circle Admah with a resigned sigh. Then, she quietly slipped away while everyone was caught in the revelry.

        ‘Admah’s plan may not bode well for Gomorrah. I must tell her the news so she can be prepared,’ Zoar thought. Having held a strong affection for Gomorrah since childhood, Zoar, of course, could not bear to see her fall into a precarious situation. Therefore, she stealthily hurried to Gomorrah’s chamber, intending to share the news with her.

        However, before she reached her destination, Zoar spotted a figure emerging from a distant chamber—a beast in a humanoid girl form.

        ‘That’s Gomorrah in her human form… She must be going to see Sodom…that captive gladiospina... I have to stop her!’ Jealousy gnawed at Zoar as she bit her lower lip. Without hesitation, she transformed into her human form and followed Gomorrah. Yet, her footsteps alerted Gomorrah to her presence.

        “Who’s there?” Gomorrah shouted, her eyes filled with murderous intent as she took up a fighting stance, ready to unleash her power. Zoar quickly spoke up, “Gomorrah! It’s me!”

        “Zoar…” Gomorrah retracted her aggressive stance; still, she remained cautious towards Zoar. With a stern voice, she asked, “What is it?”

        “Admah intends to gather the clan in the next strategy meeting to propose an assault on the gladiospinas. I know you don’t want to initiate an attack, so I’ve come to tell you the news.”

        “I’ll handle it,” Gomorrah stated flatly. As if uninterested in the beasts’ scheme, she turned away and continued toward her destination. Zoar, unwilling to watch Gomorrah leave, grabbed hold of her wrist.

        “They’ve garnered support from the majority. You won’t be able to handle it alone, but I can help you!” Zoar earnestly pleaded, “If you just agreed to pretend we’re together, I can persuade other relatives to support you and veto my brother’s proposal… Besides, it’s somewhat true since we did have an intimate relationship.”

        Several days ago, Gomorrah had fallen ill and gone down with a fever from her injuries. In her delirious state, she instinctively sought solace from Sodom but collapsed before reaching her. Unexpectedly, Zoar saved her and brought her to her chamber, where she and the confused Gomorrah shared an intimate night.

        Gomorrah stared at Zoar. Her unblinking gaze brought a scarlet flush to Zoar’s cheeks, compelling her to ask, “Why are you staring at me?”

        “Nothing,” Gomorrah said with a smile, a smile tinged with such strong mockery that made Zoar’s heart twitch, “It’s just that you’re a phantocauda after all.”

        Zoar hung her head low, filled with guilt, as she said, “I know you’re still blaming me, blaming me for alienating you because of my parents’ words. We were so close when we were small. You must have felt so hurt back then and thought I betrayed you.”

        “No, I was just too naive,” Gomorrah shook her head, “I foolishly believed that my father’s love was unconditional and skipped my training, resting on my laurels as the chieftain’s daughter until I realized that weakness is the most unforgivable crime for a phantocauda.”

        “Then… Does it mean you have forgiven me? Does it mean you’ll work with me?” Zoar eagerly asked, her eyes sparkling with feverish excitement, brimming with evident affection. However, her enthusiasm was soon dampened as she heard Gomorrah’s answer which poured on her like a bucket of cold water.

        “No.”

        “You—” Zoar hysterically asked, “All I ask is so little, yet, you still reject me. WHY?”

        “If I agree to pretend to be your partner this time, who knows if you would ask me to do it for real the next time?” Gomorrah calmly asked and continued, “It’s just like our insatiable desire for slaughter. It’s obvious that killing the elves isn’t enough because now you also want to eradicate the dragons. And you’ll keep killing, wiping out other races, since it is the only way to prove you’re the strongest.”

        “No! I would never do that!”

        “Is that so?” Gomorrah remained unmoved by Zoar’s promise. The experience of betrayal in her childhood had been etched on her memory, leaving a permanent scar in her heart and making it hard for her to believe Zoar’s words. Thus, she said, “I’m sorry, but I can’t trust you or work with you.”

        “So, you never truly forgave me!” Zoar yelled, shedding her previous thoughtful demeanor and revealing the twisted obsession rooted within her. Her sweet countenance became a grotesque scowl as her love for Gomorrah turned into hatred. She stared at Gomorrah while uttering threats through her clenched teeth, “So you’d not change your mind, even if I were to support Admah, would you?”

        “No, and never,” Gomorrah replied unemotionally, “So just do as you please.”

        “You WILL regret this!” Zoar stormed off after leaving those words. 

        Later, as Zoar had declared, in the following strategy meeting, she vehemently opposed Gomorrah’s truce proposal, tilting the situation heavily in favor of Admah. Ultimately, the phantocaudas reached a decision to launch an assault on the gladiospinas…</p>
