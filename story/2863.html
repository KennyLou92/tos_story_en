        <h1>Karmic Conquest - Chiyou</h1>
        <p>        The scorching sun hung high in the sky, casting bright rays of sunlight upon the Heavenly Kingdom in the East. As the sweltering temperature continued to rise, all the Xians stayed indoors to escape the heat, except for one muscular man with a tanned complexion. Under the blazing sun, he walked out of the Treasure Pagoda with three heavy crates on his shoulders.

        The man’s bare torso was glistening with sweat. Hot droplets of sweat kept rolling down his sculpted chest, trickling down his narrow, sturdy waistline and disappearing into his pants. His biceps bulged with visibly pulsating veins as he exerted his strength, revealing the aesthetics of power. Yet, his marvelous physique was now marred by the gloomy expression on his face. The man seemed to be in a foul mood. Furrowing his eyebrows, he muttered away to himself.

        “Huangdi and Yandi, those two bastards! How dare they set me up! I’ll give them a piece of my mind next time!” said Chiyou, one of the three Divine Xians, seethed with deep resentment. 

        In the middle of each month, when the sun shines the brightest, the three Divine Xians in charge of the Treasure Pagoda would have to move the mythical artifacts into the sunlight to dispel the lingering resentful spirits on them. However, they were forbidden to use their Xian energy during the task, as it could affect the artifacts. They had to rely solely on their strength, using their own hands to complete the task which always left them exhausted and bedridden for two days. Therefore, the three of them constantly found excuses to shift this burdensome task to one another in an attempt to evade accountability.

        Yandi and Huangdi secretly conspired and tricked Chiyou into a gambling game this month, in which the loser would bear the sole responsibility of moving the mythical artifacts. Unaware of their plot, of course, Chiyou lost miserably. It was only when he saw the triumphant smiles on the other two’s faces that he realized he had been deceived. Still, a bet is a bet. Chiyou had no choice but to carry out the task alone begrudgingly. This explained why he had been in such a foul mood.

        Wiping the sweat off his forehead with the back of his hand, Chiyou looked at the lotus in the lake, reminiscing about the beautiful Xian, He Xian’gu. The thought of her made his somber expression softened slightly.

        “He’er is so much kinder to me. She taught me chess without expecting anything in return, and she’s beautiful too… Speaking of which, it’s been a while since I last saw her. Let me go have a game of chess with her after moving the artifacts,” Chiyou thought to himself.

        Perhaps it was the newfound hope that made Chiyou become more motivated; his steps grew faster, causing the crates to shake more vigorously. Inevitably, the item placed at the top of a crate fell out amid the shaking.

        Clang! A crisp sound rang and startled Chiyou, who had been filled with excitement, freezing him in his tracks.

        “Oh no!” Chiyou quickly set down the crates on his shoulders and bent down to retrieve the fallen item, fearing that he might have damaged the precious artifact. It only took a short moment for him to spot a sparkling emerald jade piece lying next to a large stone, reflecting the bright sunlight that blinded Chiyou’s eyes.

        Despite the glare, Chiyou stepped forward to pick up the jade piece. Fortunately, the jade remained intact, albeit with a faint crack in one corner.

        “...I guess it should be fine,” Chiyou muttered to himself after examining the jade piece for a while without any further incidents. Breathing a sigh of relief, he placed the jade back on top of the crate and resumed his task of moving the artifacts. To avoid the same accident, he proceeded with extra caution and successfully moved the crates to their designated location.

        “Phew. It’s finally done. Time to find He’er—” As soon as Chiyou set the crates down, he headed toward the residence of He Xian’gu. However, he suddenly stopped when he had only gone for a few steps. As he raised his arms to his nose and took a sniff, his brows drew together into a frown, and he murmured, “Oh no, I’m covered in sweat. How can I go see He’er like this? I have to go back to my place and take a shower first!”

        Chiyou immediately changed direction and ran back home. Once his figure receded into the distance, an eerie black mist seeped out from the crack in the jade. It coalesced into a humanoid form and left.

        Unaware of the strange happening, Chiyou ran back to his house in excitement. It was after he had freshened up with a pleasant shower that he set out again, heading straight toward He Xian’gu’s residence. Yet, a deafening explosion reached his ears when he was halfway through there.

        Chiyou looked up out of concern, only to witness He Xian’gu’s residence engulfed in billowing dust. Worried about He Xian’gu, Chiyou quickened his pace and entered the house. As soon as he stepped through the door, he saw a masked man approaching He Xian’gu, who had fallen onto the floor.

        “Don’t you dare lay a finger on her!” Chiyou shouted anxiously. With his body leaping into the air, he delivered a powerful roundhouse kick toward the man. His kick sent the man flying, smashing him into the opposite wall and stirring a cloud of dust.

        Taking the opportunity, Chiyou quickly rushed to check on He Xian’gu. He breathed a sigh of relief as he realized that she had merely fainted. However, he soon flexed his muscles again and rolled to the ground to evade an ambush from behind.

        Chiyou stood up and looked toward the assailant, angrily questioning, “Who are you? Why did you try to hurt He’er?”

        “Why would I hurt He’er? She’s my future bride, I’m here to take her back so that we can have our ceremony. So, back off!”

        “You and  He’er getting married?” Chiyou repeated the man’s words in disbelief. Reflexively, he retorted, “No, it can’t be! I disagree!”

        “Don’t be ridiculous! Who are you to disagree with our marriage?”

        “I… Anyway, I won’t let you take her away! Enough with the talking, let’s fight!” Unable to come up with a better response, Chiyou decided to stop the man with force instead of words. He summoned his bone sword and attacked the man without hesitation.

        Clang! A clear and sharp sound rang out as the man unexpectedly blocked Chiyou’s attack with an identical bone sword!

        “Why does this guy have the same weapon as me?” Chiyou was shocked. However, before he could ponder further, the man launched another attack, leaving Chiyou no choice but to focus on defending himself.

        Blades clashed and their figures intertwined, with each going back and forth. Yet, Chiyou’s doubts only deepened through their repeated clashes of swords.

        “Not only do our weapons look the same, but even our attacks are identical… Who is he?” Chiyou stared at the mask on the man’s face. With a twist of his hands, he aimed all his strikes at the man’s face instead of his vital points.

        Crack!

        In a decisive attack, Chiyou finally managed to shatter the mask on the man’s face, revealing his true identity. However, the truth turned out to be a shock that froze him in place.

        “How… How do you look exactly like me?” Chiyou asked in confusion, but the man did not answer the question. Instead, he took advantage of Chiyou’s momentary lapse and sent him flying with a swing of the bone sword.

        “Argh!” Chiyou rammed into a wall with great force. Blood trickled down his mouth from the impact, his head spinning uncontrollably. In his helpless state, a dark presence loomed over his temporarily immobilized body. The man had come before Chiyou, raising his bone sword to deliver a final blow. Fortunately, a yellow talisman flew toward the man and unleashed a thunderous explosion, knocking him flying before he could strike.

        “Phew. Luckily, I made it just in time,” a man descended from the sky and landed in front of Chiyou.

        “Huangdi! What are you doing here?”

        “I’m here to clean up your mess, of course,” Huangdi replied, handing Chiyou a piece of jade that had a familiar crack on the surface. It was the same jade that Chiyou had accidentally dropped while moving the mythical artifacts earlier.

        “This is called the Heart Demon Jade. It materializes the inner demons of those who touch it,” Huangdi explained.

        “So, that guy was my inner demon… What should I do now?”

        “After you trap your inner demon with the jade, I will use my Xian arts to seal it within,” Huangdi said, tossing the jade to Chiyou so that he could prepare his sealing spell.

        Meanwhile, the inner demon had recovered from the lightning strike. With one hand covering his charred cheek, he glared angrily at Chiyou and said, “You… I was supposed to marry He’er, but how dare you ruin my face… I… I shall kill you!”

        The inner demon roared furiously and charged at Chiyou. Now that Chiyou had a newfound understanding of the situation, he was no longer confused. He stood firm, facing his raging inner demon.

        “No! How dare you hurt He’er? It’s unforgivable even if you’re my inner demon!” Chiyou exclaimed, taking out a stone of flames from his waist and swallowing it in one gulp. His power surged, transforming into raging flames that enveloped his agile body. His crimson eyes glared ferociously while an immense Xian energy overflowed throughout the courtyard.

        Infusing his bone sword with his Xian power, he swung it at the inner demon—

        Swish! The bone sword pierced through the inner demon, restraining his movements. Chiyou placed the Heart Demon Jade on the demon's forehead, channeling his Xian energy to activate the jade’s power. 

        “No… No… I don’t want to go back!” The inner demon let out a scream of agony. Nevertheless, he could not evade his fate of being pulled back into the jade.

        “Huangdi!”

        “Alright, toss me the jade!”

        Huangdi reinforced the seal on the Heart Demon Jade using his Xian arts, and successfully suppressed the inner demon, putting an end to this accident. Meanwhile, Chiyou promptly carried He Xian’gu back to her bedroom and healed her with his Xian energy. Fortunately, she only had some minor injuries that could be recovered through recuperation.

        It was when Chiyou looked at the peacefully sleeping He Xian’gu that his unsettling heart finally became quiet, allowing him to recall his doubts. He looked up at Huangdi and asked with curiosity, “By the way, why did my inner demon want to capture He’er and marry her?”

        Hearing Chiyou’s question, Huangdi could not help but stare at him in disbelief. “Are you really asking me such an obvious question?”

        “So, it’s as I thought.” Chiyou nodded knowingly. Then, he continued, “I must have been so excited to play chess with He’er that my inner demon wanted to capture her.”

        “...Do you really think that’s the reason?” Even a knowledgeable Xian like Huangdi was defeated by Chiyou’s thickness. He replied resignedly, “Well, if you say so, then so be it.”

        “What do you mean? Am I mistaken? Then tell me, why did my inner demon—”

        “Mm…”

        “He’er!” As soon as Chiyou heard He Xian’gu’s voice, he anxiously rushed to the bedside, leaving all his questions behind. He asked with concern, “How are you feeling? Any pain? Do you need me to call a doctor for you…”

        “Sigh, the answer is so obvious, but why doesn’t he realize it?” Huangdi shook his head with a smile as he watched Chiyou attentively taking care of He Xian’gu, and thought to himself, “Well, it’s funny to watch anyway. Perhaps it’d be better if I don’t tell him.”</p>
