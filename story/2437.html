        <h1>Tiny Brilliance - Blueberry</h1>
        <p>        How to be the master’s favorite elf? Blueberry already had a plan for that.

        With his implicit and gentle characteristics, Blueberry had been the favorite of the other elves in the orchard. 

        How about having others to praise him in front of the master?

        “Wow. You guys have done a great job cleaning the garden.” The orchard owner was pleased.

        Early in the morning, the orchard owner complimented as he stepped into the garden.

        “Blueberry led us,” said Green Apple.

        “Blueberry came to my bedside early in the morning, and he...Hmm...Ahh...Don’t stop! Then I came…” Banana was blushed.

        “Master, Blueberry said you needed more post-recovery rest, so he woke us up early in the morning and had us cleaned the garden with him,” said Cherry with a yawn.

        “You guys are sweet. Thank you so much,” said the orchard owner, and he continued while looking at Blueberry, “I’m so happy to have you all…”

        “Wait a second! How come all of you only gave the credit for Blueberry? He didn’t do it alone! It’s our work, right?”

        Mangosteen cut in when she saw Blueberry take all the credits.

        “Speaking of which, Blueberry really has done a lot,” Green Apple said while pondering. “He patched master’s broken boots before.”

        “Blueberry once drew me a portrait,” said Cherry.

        “Hmm, Blueberry satisfies me every night…” Banana murmured. What she meant was that Blueberry tucked her in every night.

        “I didn’t know that Blueberry is such a helpful boy. Thank you so much, Blueberry…”

        Before the orchard owner could finish his words, Mangosteen cut in agitatedly. 

        “You guys...Blueberry must have bribed you!”

        “No! He didn’t!” Green Apple, Cherry and Banana declined together, while all three of them had cookie crumbles around their mouths.

        “Ugh...You guys…”

        When Mangosteen was trying to come up with a new strategy, Blueberry spoke.

        “Master, about the Crown of Sincerity you told us yesterday, the one left by the ancient god...Can I try it on?”

        While Blueberry was speaking, he winked at Mangosteen. His expression was telling her that “I’ve won the bet and I’m Master’s favorite elf”.

        “Try it on? Sure.”

        Taking a worn crown from the altar, the orchard owner was about to put it onto Blueberry.

        Unwilling to lose to Blueberry, the desperate Mangosteen threw herself into the orchard owner and held him tight.

        “Master...Master I love you so much! I can’t let Blueberry steal you! Ahhhhh!”

        “Huh? Mangosteen…” Surprised, the orchard owner looked at Mangosteen and shifted to the rest of the elves. “Steal? What are you talking about?”

        “We’re having a bet actually…” Blueberry had no choice but to confess.

        “Hahaha! Is that so?”

        The orchard owner laughed out loud when he listened to Blueberry’s explanation.

        “You two think too much. Everything about that crown is just a lore. And everyone of you is equally important to me,” said the orchard owner.

        “Speaking of which, why did you two compete for such a petty thing?” Cherry grumbled.

        “Hmm…” The blushing Mangosteen raised her head in the orchard owner’s embrace. “I...I...I was just…”

        Mangosteen tried to find her weird behavior an excuse, but everything was stuck in her tongue.

        “I...I…” 

        As Mangosteen’s cheeks turned even more rosy, she eventually screamed and fled the scene.

        Mangosteen didn’t stop running until she found a quiet corner in the garden.

        Curling herself up, the upset Mangosteen was about to cry,

        “This is embarrassing...I embarrassed myself in front of Master…”

        At this moment, the bushes behind Mangosteen rustled. It was Blueberry coming over.

        “Humph!” Mangosteen threw her attitude at Blueberry and turned away.

        Blueberry sat next to Mangosteen without saying anything, and the two remained silent for a long while.

        Blueberry finally broke the silence.

        “I underestimated your affection. I didn’t know that you liked Master that much.”

        “Humph!” Another cold reply from Mangosteen.

        “He feels you too,” Blueberry continued.

        “...Really?” Mangosteen turned to Blueberry.

        “Yes. After you stormed away, Master said he was very glad to hear your thoughts. After all you’ve been acting coy all the time.”

        “Really…”

        Mangosteen gave a genuine smile when she found out the orchard owner’s response. At this moment, Blueberry reached out to her.

        “You’ve won...Let’s compete again next time.”

        “Humph! The victory will be mine then!” The cheerful Mangosteen held back Blueberry’s hand.

        “Alright alright…” Blueberry nodded with a smile. They reconciled at the moment their hand made contact.

        Who was the true winner of this bet? The answer was probably different in their hearts.</p>
