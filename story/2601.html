        <h1>Reverberation of the Deep - Ursula</h1>
        <p>        The mysterious R’lyeh released light; the crystals on the scales exuded dazzling colors, and ample water elements surrounded Ursula with soft waves. Immersed in her thoughts, she saw an illusion of the elements...

        Novalis acquired power from Moonlight Golem; the purplish-dark flame ignited bloodlust in his eyes, against the frightened villagers. Triggering the power of resonance, Ursula used her soft energy to pacify the restlessness of the Dragon Follower, thereby successfully saving the lives of those villagers. She pulled Novalis and bowed for apologies, and the villagers also left in awe.

        “Why did you stop me! They blamed us for bringing the monster!”
        “They’re afraid of us because they know nothing about us. As long as we show kindness, one day they’ll accept us.”
        “Impossible.”

        At this moment, Ursula had a feeling that someone was pulling her hem. She looked down and saw a little girl handing her a medicine bottle. “Please take the medicine and, thank you...for saving us.” The girl glanced at Novalis timidly, then put the medicine bottle into Ursula's hand and hurried back to her family hiding behind the house. After the farewell, Ursula turned to Novalis and smiled, who turned away with a displeased face.

        “One day, we and humans will be able to understand each other and live harmoniously. By then, the message of Primordial Dragon shall be delivered.”

        Ursula decided to stay in this village, hoping to establish relationships with these villagers, and eventually become a stronghold for humans and hybrids. However, the villagers still remained alert, so they headed out for the Deep Ones nearby, in an attempt to persuade them to coexist with the villagers. However, the Deep Ones knew well that the villagers would not even accept Ursula, let alone the half-fish hybrids.

        Until one day, a metal figure appeared at the entrance of the village, hurting the people with its purple-ish aura claw. The wounded villagers fled with fear. On the other hand, although Ursula and Novalis faced up to the enemy, their strength was no match for this demon. Therefore, they lured the enemy to the sea in the battle, and let the Deep Ones support to repel the enemy together.

        Saved twice from the verge of death, the villagers felt sorry for Ursula and finally accepted her suggestion to coexist peacefully with the Deep Ones. Even though the villagers could not hide their terror at the appearance of the half-fish, the hybrids finally found a place to live after the two species worked hard together. Full of joy, Ursula  succeeded in creating a harmonious world.

        “The dawn of the Ethereal Dragon is meant to liberate the humans from wars. He wants humans to survive...Let’s listen to resonance.”

        Ursula preached the purpose of Dagon to the people on the seaside square; the hybrids were there too, learning to understanding the language of the dragon. As the children were curious about the Dracospirit next to the Dragon Maiden, they sat around trying to touch the floating Dracospirit. But as soon as the child returned to his mother, he got scolded immediately.

        “That’s the soul of the monster! Why did you touch it! From now on you’ll never go to see that Maiden anymore.”
        “She did save us, but isn’t too much for us to live with those monsters?”
        “I can’t take it anymore! If we get rid of the Maiden, the village will be back to normal, right?”

        The villagers were obedient on the surface because they feared the power of the Ethereal Dragon, but in the bottom of their hearts they had never accepted the hybrids and the Dragon Maiden. In secrecy, the villagers were discussing how to drive the aliens away.

        One day, a villager screamed out of fear as he saw the Deep Ones summon a strange whirlpool in the sea, which had drawn Ursula’s immediate attention. “Alright, everything is fine now. Your ship can sail past.” Ursula was unaware of the malice in that villager’s eyes.

        “Now!” The villager captured Ursula with a fishing net. When he was about to stab her with a spear, the Dragon Follower withstood the attack with his halberd. “Ursula! I’ve already said it’s impossible!” Blank, Ursula looked at the villager who was beclouded by the bloodlust.

        “Ursula, humans, can never, live, harmoniously, with us.” The Deep Ones pulled the fishing net into the sea in order to release Ursula, who was deeply in the pain of being betrayed by people. Although tears could not be seen in the water, her emotions seeped from the unstable resonance…

        “Even if I’m betrayed and abandoned, I still have to pass on the voice of the Ethereal Dragon, because only I can be the bridge between humans and dragons.”</p>
