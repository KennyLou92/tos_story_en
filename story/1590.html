        <h1>Genetic Instinct of Flames - K´</h1>
        <p>
        K´’s memories had been modified by N.E.S.T.S, resulting in the blank space in his memory during his adolescence. K´ is the strongest weapon in N.E.S.T.S. He was infused with Kyo Kusanagi’s DNA, which gave him the power of pyrokinesis. The forced infusion overwhelmed his body’s limits, so he wears a special glove that keeps his power under control. K´ later joins the King of Fighters tournament with his team to find a way to regain his lost memories.</p>
