        <h1>Sougo Okita</h1>
        <p>
        A good-looking man with a baby face and a sadistic soul.

Being the 1st Division Captain of the Shinsengumi, he always slacks off on his job. He is the kind of person who causes a chorus of complaints from the neighborhood by firing his own bazooka inconsiderately during work time and brings disgrace to the Shinsengumi.

Perhaps he has a grudge against Hijikata-he always aims for Hijikata’s life no matter if he has a chance or not.

He has a hobby of watching women’s wrestling, possibly because the ugly faces of women during a battle tickles his sadistic soul.</p>
