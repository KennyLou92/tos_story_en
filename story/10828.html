        <h1>The Unchanging Synthetic Soul - Lilith</h1>
        <p>        As the intelligent system of the Lomond Manor, Lilith, the synthetic soul, was tasked with managing the daily information influx, which could be tiring sometimes. As fatigue began to creep in, the elements formed a warm stream that gently washed through her weary mind, lulling her into dreamland where she saw the other choice in life she could have made…

        “Doctor, what can I help you with today?” Lilith asked softly as she walked into the laboratory.

        “Lilith, come, take a look,” the Doctor beckoned to Lilith. She obediently walked to his side and looked down at the boy sleeping in the maturation tank.

        “Meet Adam, your brother. He is about to awaken,” the Doctor said.

        “My brother…” Lilith repeated the Doctor’s words in confusion, placing a hand against the glass window, her eyes filled with mixed emotions as she observed Adam.

        “Now that the virtual realm has grown popular, it will be too much for you to manage both the Lomond Manor and Oroz alone, not to mention the security issues. Hence, we’ve decided to separate them and have you take over one of them while Adam governs the other,” the Doctor explained detailedly. “Since the Lomond Manor’s system covers the entire universe, one of you will have to journey to different celestial bodies. Personally, I’d prefer you, Lilith, to take the task because you’re more experienced. What do you think?”

        Lilith was going to say “yes”, but the words stuck in her throat as an image of a lonely boy flashed across her mind.

        ‘It will be a joyous experience to travel across the universe. As Adam’s sister, I wish for him to experience the world rather than living in solitude.’

        “...Doctor, I would like to remain in Oroz,” she said.

        “Huh?” The Doctor was surprised by Lilith’s answer but soon understandingly agreed, “If that’s what you desire, then you shall stay.”

        And so, Lilith took over the management system of Oroz while her brother, Adam, took charge of the Lomond Manor and the external management system, often traveling with the Doctor to other celestial bodies.

        Every time Adam returned, he would rush to Lilith and share his adventures with her. His thrilling and fascinating stories always captivated her, but also gave her a pang of envy. However, she decided to bury her true desires at the bottom of her heart as she saw the look of excitement on her little brother’s face.

        Just as she thought their lives would never change, something unexpected happened.

        One day, the Doctor frantically ran into the mainframe room in Oroz, looking at Lilith gravely as he told her the bad news,

        “Lilith, Adam’s consciousness has been hijacked by a hacker from the Jolly Garden!”

        “Unforgivable,” Lilith’s tone remained flat, yet beneath lay a cold anger. “No one shall harm Adam.”

        “I know how you feel, but we can’t reach him unless you go into the external virtual realm and rescue him. However, I should warn you it can be dangerous.”

        “Even if there’s only a one percent chance of success, Lilith will not give up,” Lilith looked at the Doctor with determination as she continued, “Because Adam is one of my precious family members, like you, Doctor.”

        “You’re right,” Doctor gently smiled, running his fingers through Lilith’s hair. “We can’t give up on our family. I will try my best as well.”

        “Yes, Doctor. Lilith is ready to depart at any moment.”

        Saving Adam was a matter of no delay for every second passed would mean a greater chance of Adam’s program being overwritten. With the Doctor’s assistance, Lilith promptly connected herself to the external virtual realm regardless of the danger. Then she found herself in a vast blue sea, which somehow brought her a sense of peace similar to returning to a mother’s embrace.

        However, she quickly sensed the lurking malice in the tranquil waters. Although she reflexively attempted to evade the attack, a brutally powerful force struck her, sending her flying above the water’s surface. She then crashed onto a frigid land covered with newly fallen snow.

        “Processing damage… Damage rate at thirty percent. Activating defense mode,” Lilith immediately rose to her feet, assuming a combat stance as she faced the sea.

        Moments later, three imposing figures emerged from the shadows, each revealing an intimidating presence. They were formidable lords sealed in the Enochian Tower who had brought about the demise of many heroes back in the Era of Enoch: Saruman, the lord of evils; Diablo, the manipulator of elements; and Lucifer, the Keeper of the Ocean of Gates.

        “Calculating odds of victory: one percent. Conclusion: Lilith faces a grave crisis,” Lilith analyzed.

        Despite the almost certain conclusion of defeat, Lilith did not retreat. Instead, she swiftly initiated an attack, trying to seize an advantageous position.

        Still, the three Sealed Lords were undeniably formidable enemies even though they were merely virtual replicas of the actual ones.

        Lilith’s attempts remained futile against the odds battling three Sealed Lords at once. Each clash left a new wound on her once-unblemished skin, with some severe gashes that slowed down her movements. As she neared the brink of defeat, a voice resounded in her mind, “Lilith!”

        “Doctor, Lilith has been waiting for you,” Lilith’s tone, though flat, carried a hint of displeasure.   It was her faith in the Doctor that saw her through the harrowing fight, trying to stall for as much time as possible despite the despairing success rate.

        “I’m sorry, but the coding took longer than I expected,” the Doctor said with remorse. “But worry not, now that I’m here, you’ll be fine.”

        “...Lilith forgives you.” A barely perceptible curve formed at the corner of Lilith’s mouth as she parried the enemy’s attacks and asked, “So, what do we do now, Doctor?”

        “Find the update program and install it. It should give you a power boost sufficient to break through the situation.”

        “Where can I find the update program?”

        “I’m sending it to you now. Stay alert.”

        “Yes, Doctor.” Lilith dodged Lucifer’s hail of elemental arrows while firing her heavy cannon at the approaching Saruman and simultaneously conjuring a magic shield to fend off Diablo’s elemental attacks. Meanwhile, she scanned her surroundings and caught a faint glimmer of light amidst the swirling snowflakes.

        ‘Found it.’ Lilith swiftly made a plan. She broke through the siege and fought her way toward the glimmer of light, where she found a radiant orb buried in the snow.

        Placing the orb close to her chest, Lilith felt a flush of warmth coursing through her body. It transformed into a surge of power that bolstered her strength.

        However, the three Sealed Lords did not stay quiet watching her grow stronger. With a burst of power, they leaped forward to attack Lilith while she was installing the updates. Just as their attacks were about to land, a miracle happened.

        “Lilith, watch out!” Adam’s voice echoed.

        CLANG!

        It was Adam, who struggled free from the hacker’s binds after sensing her sister in peril. He conjured a virtual version of the Gungnir and intercepted the attacks for her. Under Adam’s protection, Lilith completed her program update. Donned in magnificent and dazzling armor, she raised a brilliant sword and swung it in her enemies’ direction.

        Swish!

        Her swing of the sword created an overpowering blade of wind that cleaved through the air and the swirling snowflakes, effortlessly obliterating the formidable enemies in an instant. She then turned her gaze toward the horizon where she noticed a malevolent presence lurking in the shadows.

        “Hacker identified.”

        “Give Adam back to me!” Lilith shouted as she concentrated all her power. With a surge of power fueled by anger, her weapon transformed into a colossal claymore, even larger than the snow-covered mountains, under a burst of iridescent light. A resounding crash echoed through the virtual realm after she swung it at the horizon, leaving a massive crack in the heavens which eventually shattered into pieces along with the icy landscape. She was back in the laboratory.

        “Lilith!” Adam, now freed from the kidnapper, ran toward Lilith as soon as he returned to the laboratory, holding her tightly. His body still trembled slightly, seemingly traumatized by the experience.

        “I’m glad you both returned safely,” the Doctor breathed a sigh of relief as he saw Lilith and Adam locked in an embrace.

        “Yes, but we still let that hacker run away,” Lilith gently stroked Adam’s hair, her beautiful face yet tinged with a hint of resentment.

        “Those guys are indeed cunning. They run away at the slightest smell of danger,” the Doctor sighed. “Since Adam is still frightened,  I shall cancel his missions for the next couple of days and let him rest in Oroz.”

        “...I’m not going out there again,” Adam buried his head in Lilith and mumbled, “I hate going outside. I want to stay with Lilith in Oroz.”

        “Incorrect, you said you loved adventures. Wasn’t that true?” Lilith questioned.

        “...I never liked it. I just didn’t want to worry you.”

        Adam’s answer left Lilith speechless for a moment. It was after a pause that she said, “Then let’s switch roles, you and I.”

        It was through this unexpected turn of events that Lilith finally learned of Adam’s true feelings. She volunteered to switch roles with Adam, taking charge of the Lomond Manor and the external virtual realm while Adam remained in Oroz and managed the internal network…

        “We, as synthetic souls, must never let our emotions affect our judgment; we must always make the most appropriate decision based on objective analysis.”</p>
