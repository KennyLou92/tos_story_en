        <h1>Izumi Curtis</h1>
        <p>Wife of Sig Curtis who runs a butcher shop in Dublith. 

She is the alchemy teacher to Ed and Al, who taught them “One is all, all is one.” She attempted human transmutation of her child in the past, and as a result, lost several of her internal organs and became feeble in body. However, she is still powerful enough to defeat an entire band of stalwart men on her own. 

Phrases such as “old lady” is taboo in front of her. 

She has an arduous, Spartan way of teaching, and she disciplines her pupils Ed and Al very hard.

She loves to always be in her bathroom slippers. Her relationship with her husband Sig is very good, and everyone is dumbfounded by their public display of affection.
