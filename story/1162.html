        <h1>Envious Heresy Founder</h1>
        <p>        Chryseis was the daughter of Troy’s high priest. Since she was small, Chryseis had to practice dancing, learn magic, and study religion to become the priestess of the God of the Sun.  With an enchanting appearance, Chryseis received a lot of attention from men.

        Chryseis always exploited her status as the daughter of the high priest, and presumed to act as the leading dancer.  This prideful personality drove her to practice dancing more than the others, and hence she surpassed every one of them.  However, with great skill came supreme arrogance.  Wherever she went, a few junior dancers would follow behind her, and further behind were her admirers.  If the princess did not have greater fame, people might have mistaken Chryseis as the princess of Troy.

        Whenever Cassandra, the princess of Troy, appeared, Chryseis’ admirers would shift their adoring focus onto the princess.  This always prompted uneasiness in the egotistic Chryseis, causing her difficulties in being truly respectful toward Cassandra.  When she learned that the dance in admiration of Apollo required her to follow Cassandra’s lead, a spark of envy struck Chryseis’ heart.  Later, she lost to Cassandra in the contest for the place of lead dancer.  The God of the Sun even descended to grant Cassandra his powers and assigned her as his personal priestess.  Knowing this, the spark of envy turned into a wildfire in Chryseis.

        “The seeds of the war will be sowed here.  The selfishness of the gods will lead Humans into civil war.”  Since receiving the power of prophecy, Cassandra frequently enlightened the masses in the town square, but with worrying prophecies.

        “That’s a fallacy!”, “She’s the priestess of doom!”, “What kind of priestess is she?!”  Chryseis took this opportunity and used her followers to spread words of slander about Cassandra.

        The people’s lives were stable and peaceful all along, rendering Cassandra’s prophecies about wars implausible.  Together with the deliberately created rumors, hatred toward the princess was prompted among the people.  It was not until the king stripped her of her princely title did the masses’ anger soothe.  Chryseis felt much better now seeing Cassandra “lose” like this, but the flame of envy did not entirely go out — the God of the Sun still cared only about Cassandra, and always protected her; he never even looked at Chryseis.

        When the wars induced by Gods eventually erupted, Cassandra told numerous prophecies of death.  The God of the Sun also appeared in front of the people, but he only approached Cassandra and whispered a few words to her before returning to the realm of gods again.

        ‘God of the Sun, I am your priestess, too!  Why do you only look at Cassandra?  What is so special about her?  She is not the princess anymore, but I am the daughter of the previous high priest!’ The flames of envy within her burned so bright that even her eyes seemed to redden. The hot blaze clouded her vision to see Cassandra’s sorrowful tears.  Chryseis only witnessed the fact that she was not treated especially by the God of the Sun. ‘God of the Sun...If you don’t recognize the one who really devotes to you, why should I follow you so blindly?’

        Chryseis no longer worshipped the God of the Sun; she told her followers to persuade the others into leaving with her. She built a religion based around herself and was worshipped since then.  However, envy never left her.  She hated any religion that had more followers than hers, but what she did not realize was that the religion with the most worshippers would never be hers — When the first spark was ignited, Chryseis was destined to forever live her life in the blazing fire of envy...</p>
