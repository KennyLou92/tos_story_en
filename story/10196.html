        <h1>Prince Hata</h1>
        <p>The prince of planet Oukoku.
He is known for his infatuation with exotic animals instead of cute pets. People call him “Prince Baka”.
Every time he brings a rare animal to Kabukicho,there will be chaos.

He is a troubling prince that even though he has expressed a tendency to introspect about his deed, he always forgets it and soon does it again.

The thing that looks like a tentacle on his head is his best feature but it is frequently ripped off by others. </p>
