        <h1>Refracted Luster - Auralite 23</h1>
        <p>
                In the Kingdom of Raimonia, a regal girl, accompanied by a retinue of attentive servants, gracefully strolled down the wide corridors of the grand palace. 

        The girl was a minerelf. Unlike most creatures, minerelves were born with adult bodies. However, their forms aged backward, from senescence to infancy, as the gemstones inside them gradually shed over time. Thus, despite the girl’s tender and adorable appearance, she was, in fact, the Queen of Raimonia.

        The Queen entered a dressing chamber where a young man, dressed formally, sat—he was her son, Auralite.

        “Auralite? Splendid, you’re already dressed! It’s time to go; the banquet is about to commence,” the Queen cheerily said. Yet, the young man gave no response. Sensing something amiss, the Queen pushed past her attendants and strode to her son.

        “This is... a clone!” The moment the Queen saw the young man’s featureless countenance, she recognized that it was a dummy crafted by Auralite. Stamping her feet, she exclaimed, “That little RASCAL! He’s sneaked away again!”

        While the Queen screamed at the palace, the real Auralite, who had made his way to the town, sneezed on a bustling street. After wiping his nose with a handkerchief, he closed his eyes to connect with his clone. It was after a moment that he murmured, “Hmm… She found out, but it took her more time than I thought. It seems my clone has been refined since no one could tell it was a clone right away.”

        ‘Still, the clone was just a tactic to stall for time. Mother would probably make more arrangements for me after I get back to the palace,’ Auralite thought as he gazed toward the palace, feeling rather trapped. ‘Does being a prince mean I do not have the freedom to choose my own wife?’

        Yet, a sudden event interrupted his musings on his status.

        A horse, seemingly spooked, dashed into the street while thrashing its head uncontrollably. The woman in the saddle attempted to calm the horse, but her efforts proved futile.

        ‘Oh no! People would get hurt if the horse ran into the city center. I must stop it!’ Auralite, feeling a sense of duty—one that had been instilled into him as a prince—to protect his subjects, rushed forward regardless of the danger while conjuring multiple clones with his power.

        “Go!” Auralite commanded his clones to intercept the horse while making a flying leap at the end of his run-up, ultimately landing on the horse’s back. It was in a collective effort with his clones that he managed to stabilize the startled horse before disaster could ensue.

        “Thank you for saving me. If not for you, I would have had to atone for the harm to any innocent citizens with my life,” the woman, breathing a sigh of relief, expressed her gratitude to Auralite with a smile. However, her smile soon faded at the sound of shouting that came from her back.

        “There she is!” Several guards maneuvered their steeds toward them, their menacing gaze fixed on their target—the woman.

        “As much as I want to thank you properly, it seems I won’t have the chance,” the woman shrugged resignedly. “You should leave now; I do not wish to get you involved.”

        As Auralite looked at the woman, who was as lively as a blooming flower just a moment ago, now wilted and crestfallen, he felt a pang of empathy which swiftly turned into words that rolled off his tongue, “Do you want to run?”

        “Huh?” The woman raised her head in surprise. She locked eyes with Auralite, who was taller than her. In his eyes, she found a hint of distress that reminded her of her own, and in that fleeting moment, it felt like they were the only two people in the world.

        “Do you want to run?” Auralite asked again.

        “Yes!” the woman answered without hesitation this time.

        Auralite smiled at the woman’s answer. Tightening his grip on the reins, he told her, “Hold on tight then!”

        As soon as the woman wrapped her arms around Auralite’s waist, she felt her body momentarily suspended in the air as the horse galloped out of the town like a gust of wind, disappearing from the pursuers’ sight.

        The two rode until they reached a forest where the pursuers lost them.

        “Haha, that was awesome! Thank you!” The woman could not help but burst into laughter as she recalled the defeated look on the guards’ faces. The sense of freedom from the cage that she had been long confined lifted her spirits, bringing an even more radiant glow to her beautiful face. 

        “It was nothing at all.” A subtle smile curved at the edge of Auralite’s mouth as he was infected by the woman’s laughter. For once in a long time, he forgot his status and responsibilities as a prince and allowed himself to enjoy the rare moment of freedom.

        “By the way, do you have a moment afterward?” the woman asked.

        “Why ask?” Auralite inquired.

        “You’ve helped me so much. I would like to take you to my secret hideout, as a token of gratitude,” the woman said.

        Usually, Auralite would have turned down the invitation. However, his heart involuntarily softened when he saw the woman’s mischievous smile. He nodded and followed the woman’s instruction, steeling the horse to a secluded hillside.

        After dismounting, the two walked to the edge at the end of a dense forest, where they saw a spectacular sight: two towering cliffs where the sun set in the middle, tinging the horizon with a fiery gold while casting a radiant hue over the trees and the earth.

        Even Auralite, who had seen much in his life, was moved by the beauty of the breathtaking scenery.

        “Isn’t it magnificent?” the woman murmured, “All my troubles seem insignificant every time I’m here. It gives me the courage to keep moving forward.”

        The woman then turned to Auralite. The sunset glow on her flawless face gave her a heavenly charm that mesmerized Auralite, one that made his heart thump.

        “That’s why I wanted to share this view with you. I hope you can find the courage to overcome whatever difficulties that come your way,” the woman continued.

        “Thank you,” Auralite replied sincerely. “This is the best gift I’ve ever received.”

        The sun soon dipped below the horizon, and it was time for them to face reality. Together they rode back to the town where they parted ways. Before bidding goodbye, Auralite took the woman’s hand and asked, “May I know your name, please?”

        “...Topaz, my name is Topaz.”

        ‘That’s… That’s the name of my date… So she ran away from the banquet as well, just like I did… ’ As surprising as it was, Auralite quickly accepted the reality. His emotions ultimately turned into a smile as he spoke tenderly, “It’s a beautiful name. I’m sure we will meet again soon.”

        He then turned and left before Topaz could react. As soon as he returned to the palace, he requested a meeting with Topaz from the Queen and eventually forged a wonderful relationship that led to a happy marriage...</p>
