        <h1>Battlefield Dominator - Lü Bu</h1>
        <p>        On the disorderly battlefield, a wounded soldier was getting up from the ground only to see a terrifying scene—several soldiers were knocked flying in the air, and falling in his direction! Bang! He was crushed beneath the pile of soldier bodies which could be seen everywhere in the field. Yet, what knocked them flying were no weapons or cannons but the blasts of wind caused by the war between the two people in the center!

        ‘Neigh——’ The skeletal horse reared up with a cry. On its back was the bedemoned Lü Bu, who held out his halberd. With his eyes filled with blood lust, he then rode forward.

        Celestial Supremacy, on the hand, took the horse stance with a spinning ball of green light in his palm, showing no intention to escape. He stared at the horse’s hoofs to read its movement, then he threw a punch in the ground, creating a depression that tripped the skeletal horse. The horse fell forward hard, so hard that made a mud track behind it.

        Yet, Lü Bu, who had foreseen that, jumped off before the skeletal horse fell, raised his halberd, and slashed at his opponent! Boom! As the blast of purple mist rocked the soil, Lü Bu found that his attack missed. Suddenly, a spin kick came at him from the side. He squatted to avoid it but failed to notice that abnormally powerful green light behind him——

        Cling! His halberd was knocked into the air and eventually plunged straight into the ground after several spins…

        Just then, a red electric spark buzz in the flying dust. Finding his opponent and himself both took a step back, Lü Bu discovered the thing standing between them was, astonishingly, a poker card!

        ‘Hearty! What are you doing here?!’ Lü Bu recognized that it was the power of the Queen of Hearts at the first glance.

        ‘It’s not the right time to chat.’ The Queen of Hearts emerged from the sand and dust with a pair of giant flaring claws facing their opponent, Celestial Supremacy.

        Ever since the Queen of Hearts found that Lü Lingshuang was back to Lü Bu, she knew she could not bring down his murderous desire no matter how so she no longer attempted to stop him with magic.

        However, the anxiety in her heart only grew since the birth of their child; she was afraid that the child’s father might die on the battlefield someday. So she tried to use their daughter as an excuse to keep Lü Bu around, hoping the days he spent with their daughter would make a change…

        When their daughter was born, Lü Bu was indeed a caring father and husband. However, his attention shifted to his daughter’s combat ability as she grew up. As a father, the first thought that came to Lü Bu’s mind was not caring but disappointment when his daughter accidentally burned herself with her magic power…

        Watching all of these, the Queen of Hearts knew that Lü Bu had never let go of his pursuit of war so she made up his mind, “since I can’t change your thirst for bloodshed, then let me accompany you to the battlefield whenever you fight!”

        While Lü Bu was asleep, the Queen of Hearts put a poker card on his armor so that she could sense his location and his murderous desire at any time. Every time Lü Bu boiled with desire, the poker card would heat and aggravate her anxiety. Only when the poker card cooled down could she find relief and stroke the face of her sleeping daughter gently.

        But the scorching heat on the poker card lasted long this time. Frantic with worry, the Queen of Hearts took the card and looked at it alone after entrusting her daughter to her subjects.

        The Queen of Hearts knew that Alice had let her be since her last ambush. ‘You are the one who says you’re staying. Haha, it’s none of my business. Let’s keep playing.’

        It would not be hard to go under Alice’s nose so the Queen of Hearts tried something that she had not done before—teleporting herself to where Lü Bu was through telepathy!

        ‘If I can’t even protect my woman, how can I, Lü Bu, live up to name as the one!’ Lü Bu walked to the front of the Queen of Hearts to protect her after retrieving his halberd.

        Meanwhile, Celestial Supremacy also took a stance with his right palm facing forward, waiting for his opponent’s move. He then said, ‘leave, woman. This is not where you should come.’

        Just as Lü Bu was conjuring the purple mist, the giant claws beside him suddenly blasted a burst of fierce fire, causing a fire whirl on the battlefield. A deck of poker cards was arrayed before Lü Bu with their edges pointing at Celestial Supremacy. As the embodiment of the fighting spirit of the Queen of Hearts, the heart suits on the cards were steaming. Showing no fear, she stepped forward and stood in line with Lü Bu.

        ‘I know I can’t stop you, so I’ll fight with you instead! Then we shall go home together.’

        ‘Hearty…’ Lü Bu was moved by the understanding of the Queen of Hearts. Feeling a warm commotion in his heart, he turned and stood by her side.

        However, that commotion also stirred up the overwhelming murderous desire inside him. With the unleashed blue light, his expression changed and revealed a craving for wanton slaughter…</p>
