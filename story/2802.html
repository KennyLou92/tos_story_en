        <h1>Merry Amble - Komainu</h1>
        <p>        After bidding Nello farewell, the Merry Puppy and Grumpy Puppy stayed on the knoll. They did not feel different for the first two days, but the two began to miss Nello more and more day after day.

        Lying down on the grass, Merry and Grumpy were gazing upon the sky. Just then, a cloud drifted across.

        “Hey, Grumpy, does that cloud look like Nello to you?” Merry whimpered gloomily.

        “No,” Grumpy answered placidly. No matter how hard Grumpy tried to use its imagination, the cloud still looked nothing like Nello except for its roundness which was similar to his head.

        “But it just looks like Nello to me, and now everything just looks like him… Grumpy, what should I do? I miss him so much. Do you miss him? If you do, how about we——”

        “How about we go find him together? That’s what you wanted to say, right? But we don’t know where he is. Where are you even going to start?” Grumpy saw through Merry at a glance and ruthlessly cut the latter off.

        “We-we can just go out and take a look first. Maybe we can smell him as soon as we leave the knoll.” Merry tried to defend itself, but deep down it knew that Grumpy was right.

        “I think you’re more likely to get lost first.”

        “What?! That’s not true!” Merry barked bitterly and pouted, facing away from Grumpy. Seeing that, Grumpy tried to mollify Merry by giving the latter a gentle push with its paw.

        Merry did not turn around at the first and second push but only at the third. ‘What is it? Are you coming with me to find Nello?’

        “No,” Grumpy shook its head and paused before it continued, ‘Do you have any idea of what to give as a gift?’

        “Umm… The fruits on the trees on the eastern hill are big and juicy. They should be ripe by now. They must taste very good…”

        The thought of juicy fruits made Merry salivate. It was not until Grumpy had left for a while that it came back to its senses. “Wait, why did Grumpy ask me that?”

        So the puzzled Merry tracked Grumpy’s scent, only to find that the latter went toward a forest it had never been to after plucking a fruit. It then kept following Grumpy, only by doing so that it could keep itself from getting lost.

        Soon, Grumpy stopped in front of a cottage. Carrying the fruit in its mouth, it knocked at the wooden door with its paw. Then a smiley female dog with soft hair and tender eyes showed up and welcomed Grumpy into the house.

        ‘Wh-wh-what the heck?! Grumpy has found a mate?!’ Thunderstruck by what it saw, Merry unwittingly began to wander in the forest in complete perplexity.

        Suddenly, rain started to pour. As Merry’s hair was drenched in the rain, it finally came to its senses and found itself lost in the woods.

        What was even worse was that the rain had washed away Grumpy’s scent and it could not find its way back by smell. A sense of frustration began to well up at the thought of the current despairing situation it was in.

        “Now that Nello is gone and Grumpy has a mate, I’m just a forlorn dog that nobody cares! Boohoo!” wailed Merry, without noticing a paw on its shoulder which jolted it into a jump. It then looked back, only to see Grumpy looking at it resignedly.

        “What are you doing here? …Were you following me?”

        “Yeah. I would never know that you have been keeping a secret from me if I didn’t.”

        “A secret? What am I keeping from you?”

        “Stop the act. I saw it. Your mate was beautiful.” Merry wiped its tears and smiled at Grumpy, yet its tail was hanging low.

        “A mate?” Grumpy frowned, not knowing what Merry was talking about. It only dawned on it after pondering for a while. “Oh, you saw that.”

        “Yeah. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of myself. You can just stay with your mate—— Ouch! That hurts! What’s that for?!”

        “For what an idiot you are! There was nothing between me and that female dog. I was asking it for information.”

        “Huh? Information for what?” asked Merry curiously while rubbing the bump on its throbbing head.

        “You said you wanna find Nello, so I went to gather information regarding his whereabouts. You aren’t expecting us to roam around the world to find him, are you? That was an informant dog!”

        ‘“Aww, Grumpy! I’m sorry for misjudging you!” Merry howled in excitement, raising its head up high. After circling around Grumpy for a while, it pounced on the latter with its tail wagging in delight.

        “Sigh. Stop it. Hurry up and get packed. We’re leaving tomorrow.”

        “Okay!” Merry followed Grumpy closely, sticking together just like the day when they were born…</p>
