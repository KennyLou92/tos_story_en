        <h1>Tears of Heartbreak - Andromeda
</h1>
        <p>        With Apollo’s endorsement, Andromeda and Hercules had an audience with Aether, who granted them the power of astralists. After that, they were commissioned to carry out different missions in places of Tarones. It was not until the Summoners and the Zodiacs broke into the realm of gods that they were summoned by Apollo in an emergency.

        “Andromeda, Giemsa has betrayed us and fled. Take Hercules and a batch of god soldiers with you to search around the entrance, and be sure to capture her!” Apollo gave the order in a deep voice.

        “Don’t worry. I will definitely bring her back to you.’ Andromeda walked to Apollo, reaching out her hand to gently rub his furrowed brow. “So stop frowning.”

        “Mm.” As Apollo looked at Andromeda, his stretched nerves were slightly relieved. He then took Andromeda’s hand and gave her a word of warning tenderly, “Giemsa has a highly experienced constellation with her, so please be careful.”

        ‘That’s great. Then I can avenge Perseus’ death.’ Andromeda, who had obtained the astralist power, thought to herself confidently. Little did she know that what awaited her would be a quirk of fate—she saw Perseus, her young love whom she thought had been dead!

        The two met again at a ruin at the entrance to the realm of gods when Andromeda was searching for Giemsa with Hercules and the other god soldiers. Just then, Andromeda caught a glimpse of a flashing shadow so she promptly chased after it, only to find that the figure looked uncannily familiar.

        It was only when the man turned around and Andromeda saw his familiar face that she believed she was not having hallucinations.

        “Perseus! You…are alive! Thank god… Boohoo.” With her eyes filled with sudden tears of joy, Andromeda was too overwhelmed to notice the less joyous look on Perseus’ face. Just when she wanted to run into his arms, Hercules grabbed her by the wrist and stopped her.

        “Herc, why are you stopping me?” As much as Andromeda wanted to free herself from Hercules’ grip, the latter held her hand even tighter. She then asked him in bewilderment, “What is it with that sullen look on your face? Aren’t you happy to see Perseus alive?”

        “Didn’t you see?” Hercules stared at the person behind Perseus. Andromeda followed the direction of his gaze and found a woman hiding behind Perseus.

        “That is Giemsa…” A ripple of disquiet spread across Andromeda’s heart. Yet, she still tried to make excuses for Perseus and talked to him with a smile, “Perseus, I know that you must have captured her since you knew her disloyalty. That’s excellent. Master Apollo has sent us to capture her, so hand her over to us. Master Apollo will surely reward you justly.”

        Instead of answering Andromeda, Perseus looked at the circle of god soldiers around him more vigilantly, as if he was looking for an escape route. 

        “Perseus! Please!” Without getting any response from him, Andromeda began to beg anxiously.

        “...I’m sorry.” However, Perseus’ words shattered her hope. At a loss for words, she could only let tears brim in her eyes.

        On the contrary, Hercules, who was standing aside, was not much surprised. Looking at Perseus, he calmly said, “Then don’t blame me for this.”

        Then he kicked his foot, raised his fist and charged at Perseus. Even though Perseus vigilantly lifted his arms to block the attack, he was still knocked a few steps back. Meanwhile, Hercules seized the moment to press home his advantage, leading to a neck and neck fight for a while.

        ‘Why…Perseus and Hercules are best friends. Why are they fighting against each other now?’

        Seeing as Perseus clashed with Hercules, Andromeda felt like her heart had been torn into pieces. Anger and resentment flared up within her. With no place to vent her rising emotions, she could only glare at Giemsa while placing the blame on her, “It’s you! You must have beguiled Perseus! You are not getting away with this!”

        With the power of astralists, Andromeda conjured a giant water ball to attack Giemsa. The latter promptly created a shield with a wave of her hand to protect herself. While the water ball fell on the shield and spattered into countless water drops, Giemsa remained uninjured inside it.

        “Darn it!” Andromeda resentfully gritted her teeth. Then she raised her hand to signal the god soldiers behind her, giving a command aloud, “Soldiers, attack!”

        All the soldiers began to attack Giemsa’s shield. Even though each of their attacks was weak—many a little makes a mickle—they managed to weaken the shield over time.

        “Perseus will regain his sanity soon after I defeat her!” Andromeda naively thought. To make her wish come true, she channeled her astralist power again and conjured numerous ice spikes over Giemsa’s head. As she swung her arms down, the spikes fell down on Giemsa with immense killing intent.

        With a clatter, Giemsa’s shield was finally shattered.

        “Cough!” Giemsa coughed up blood as her power backfired on her. Kneeling on the ground feebly, she lifted her head to look at Andromeda, who had walked to her front.

        “As long as you are gone, Perseus will come back to me, so…” With a blade made of water elements in her hand, Andromeda’s appealing face was distorted by an inexplicable sense of paranoia along with an unusual madness. Then she continued, “Please DIE!”

        She abruptly slashed the blade at Giemsa, yet a long sword cut in horizontally and knocked the blade out of her hand. As the water blade flew past Andromeda and cut her wrist, blood began to gush out, followed by a sharp pain shooting through her. However, that pain was nothing compared to one in her heart.

        Andromeda looked at Perseus in shock. Even though the latter was covered in blood after defeating Hercules, he still managed to save Giemsa with the little strength he had left. Alert and defensive, he looked at Andromeda in a completely different way from the past, which eventually turned the shock inside Andromeda into a bitter chill as cold as the winter snow.

        Andromeda’s head was buzzing. Her mind was flooded by the memories of her and Perseus: he stood up for her when she was bullied by the other dancers; he cheered for her when she shone brightly on stage. He was always there with her, supporting and protecting her. She thought that she held a special place in his heart. What had happened to all those beautiful moments? What had turned them into irretrievable memories that seemed to be only fading away?

        “You used to take care of me in every possible way. You couldn’t even bear to see a wound on me, but why…” Andromeda sobbed with agony with tears falling from her eyes, “How could you hurt me so ruthlessly now… My heart is aching… and I feel so hurt… Why… Tell me why!”

        “...Because this is the justice I have to uphold.” After gazing at Andromeda deeply for a moment, Perseus then helped Giemsa up and walked in another direction while screening her with his body.

        Andromeda lifted her hand to aim at Perseus, but it took forever for her to launch an attack. In the end, she just watched as the two figures disappeared into the gate of the realm of gods…

        ‘Still, I can’t bear to hurt you even though you’ve gone the opposite way to me…’</p>
