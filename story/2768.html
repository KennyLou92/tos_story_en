        <h1>Nohime the Willowy Sublimity</h1>
        <p>Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 5

        In order to escape the pursuit of the assassin organization, Nohime came to an unknown island under a mysterious man’s instruction. On this island full of mad men and danger, she met a young man, Nobunaga, and together the two of them struggled to survive. Later, they ran into Hideyoshi, a young man, and Akechi, who was a friend of Nobunaga.

        And so, the four continued their journey as a group. Unexpectedly, they encountered Honda, a man who attacked them straightaway and knocked Hideyoshi and Akechi out. Seeing themselves at a disadvantage, Nobunaga and Nohime decisively retreated.

        Fortunately, they managed to elude Honda’s pursuit and took Hideyoshi and Akechi to a safe cave through collaborative efforts.

        However, Nohime’s instinct that had been developed over years of assassination told her that there would be some crucial clues in Honda. So she told Nobunaga about her plan to follow Honda after putting Hideyoshi and Akechi in the cave.

        ‘So it was not just me. I also found it strange. That man was clearly delirious…’ Nobunaga, whose face looked abnormally pale under the sunlight, rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then he said with a nod, ‘I’ll go with you.’

        ‘Stop joking around. Who will take care of them if you and I are both gone?’

        ‘But it’s dangerous for you to go alone——’

        ‘At least it’s safer than following that man with an injured.’ Nohime looked at Nobunaga with a frown—the latter’s forehead was already beaded with cold sweat, which was obviously a reaction to the agonizing pain in his body.

        ‘Uh… Of course you knew it.’ Sensing Nohime had noticed his injury, Nobunaga stopped acting tough and slumped against the cave wall with his right hand pressing his left arm that was wounded by Honda.

        Seeing as Nohime stood up to leave, Nobunaga knew that he could not stop her, so he could only warn her, ‘Remember that your own safety should come first no matter what. Just retreat when you see any danger. I will come to find you if I don’t see you back here by dusk.’

        ‘...Mm.’ Nohime responded softly; there was a note of tenderness in her normally cold voice. Then with a kick of his leg, she disappeared into the woods.

        Following the special smell of the smoke bomb, Nohime soon found Honda and witnessed a shocking scene—Honda slid into madness at his daughter’s death. A man took the moment of Honda’s vulnerability to control the weapon on the latter and let it take over him completely.

        “He must be the man behind all of this. I have to follow him.” Despite the foreseeable danger, Nohime still decided to take the risk and follow the man, Tokugawa, quietly for her desire to know the truth.

        Tokugawa and Honda kept walking forward until they arrived at a lake. As Tokugawa took out something from his chest and clinked it against the air, a gust of strong wind suddenly blew and startled the birds that they flew away immediately. Then, a three-story building appeared on the limpid lake as if it had been there all along.

“This house… So it was hidden by some kind of tricks just now?” thought Nohime. “Nevertheless, I can’t rashly go in there. Let me just go back and meet Nobunaga and the others to make a detailed plan first.”

        However, the man took a step ahead of Nohime—Tokugawa, who was standing in front of the lake, turned around and looked at where she was hiding.

        ‘Since I have gotten my final product, I was in such a good mood that I was going to spare you, given that all of you will be killed by my magic circle in the end anyway. But you just have to come to me and that left me no choice,’ said Tokugawa, who then tilted his chin at Honda. ‘Go play with her.’

        Nohime had already begun her escape when she heard the first word from Tokugawa. While swinging through the air in the woods with her wires, the only thought in her mind was just to run away from Tokugawa and Honda as far as possible.

        Seeing the fleeing Nohime, Honda did not chase after her immediately, but silently took up a punching stance in her direction instead.

        Chuff——a jet of steam came out from the suit of armor on Honda’s body. The gears in his metal arms were spinning and rolling, emitting a sound similar to a beast’s groan. As Honda twisted his body and swung a punch at the air, a monstrous shock wave roared like a rumble of thunder.

        Following the sound, all the trees around collapsed and Nohime was flung far away by the shock wave. She fell to the ground and tumbled over several times before she stopped.

        By that time, Honda had already come to somewhere a few steps away from Nohime. The latter alertly jumped backward while waving her hands to shoot countless wires at Honda with immense killing intent. However, all her wires were blown away by the swirling air around Honda before they could even get close to him.

        Seeing the metal arm coming at her slowly, Nohime felt like everything before her eyes had slowed down hundreds and thousands of times.

        “I… don’t want to die yet…” Nohime clenched her dagger. “I have to live!”

        A burst of blinding light came from Nohime’s body—countless wires wrapped around her and formed a white full armor, cocooning her from Honda’s punch.

        As the white cocoon was shattered, Nohime adroitly leaped out of it and moved around Honda at a high speed. Her dagger and wires grazed the latter’s armor, striking sparks everywhere. Meanwhile, Honda kept swinging his metal arms, raining down punches one after another. However, all his punches missed—they were either dodged or softened by Nohime with her wires.

        Like a beast, Honda let out a low wail with a jet of steam coming out from his right arm again.
　　
        “No! I can’t let him land that blow again!” Nohime inserted numerous wires into the gaps in Honda’s armor, leaving the gears in his metal arms incapacitated.
　　
        Unexpectedly, Honda stopped his punch and pulled the wires hard, drawing Nohime directly to him. The next moment, wind-breaking punches began to fall on the latter’s body like a shower of bombs.

        Coughing out blood, Nohime was knocked flying to the air and hit a tree trunk badly. Honda only walked away slowly after he saw her lying on the ground with no breath like a piece of rag.

        It was only until Honda had receded did Nohime start gasping for air. With the wires wrapping her abdomen, she looked as though she had put on a silk garment from a distance, which kept her alive from the verge of death. Just then, he heard familiar footsteps.

        “It’s him…” Just as she had anticipated, it was Nobunaga, who anxiously came to hold her up as soon as he saw her after walking through the bushes.

        ‘...I’m still alive…’ After taking a deep breath, Nohime grabbed Nobunaga’s collar and said desperately, ‘You have to stop him immediately… Or else everyone is gonna die on this island.’

        Nobunaga’s face darkened and grew more solemn as Nohime recounted what had happened.

        ‘Anyway, they are very dangerous, so bring Hideyoshi and Akechi with you.’ Nohime’s attentiveness was greatly impaired by her injury that she did not notice the dimmed eyes of Nobunaga when she mentioned the names of the two other men. Yet, Nobunaga suppressed his emotions right away. Thumping his chest, he said, ‘No problem. I’ll handle it. You just go hide in a safe place and stay put.’

        After Nohime had responded with a feeble nod, she watched as Nobunaga walked into that building on the lake alone…</p>
