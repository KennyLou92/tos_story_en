        <p>
        She is the Ancestral Elements. Raised by Seth, Shu, Ra and Tefnut, she is given the name, Atum, which means the evening sun.

Before growing up, she was an energetic and compassionate girl who was also courageous to try new things despite the fear she had at first. She later becomes a tough and persevering woman who decides to carry on her parentsâ€™ dream and protect the land that was created by the primordial dragons.</p>
