        <h1>Unwholesome Roots - Pan Jinlian</h1>
        <p>        In a tranquil mountain, far away from the bustling city, stood a modest and unassuming temple. Despite the serene countryside, the temple was now thronged with people, from commoners to nobles, from poor to rich. All of them had come together to listen attentively to the man seated on the raised platform reading the sutra.

        The man was none other than the esteemed monk, Wu Yu, the foremost Zen master of the Danxuan school. With his right hand raised, moving the mala beads through his fingertips, he spoke with a warm and soothing voice, “In the past, our ancestors, Tang Sanzang and his disciples, embarked on an ascetic journey. After enduring numerous hardships and obstacles, they finally made it to the West where they found the celestial solution to the world’s chaos. To guide all beings to the great path that leads to the end of suffering, they founded the school and this temple. And now, I, Wu Yu, shall carry forth their teachings to impart the principles of the great path.”

        Mu Yu gently hit the singing bowl at his feet, producing a profound and melodious tune that sent shivers down the spines of the audience below. A palpable, intangible force seemed to delve into their beings and stir their spirits.

        “Avalokiteshvara, while practicing deeply with the insight that brings us to the other shore, suddenly discovered that all of the five Skandhas are equally empty, and with this realization, he overcame all ill-being…”

        Wu Yu began to recite the Heart Sutra, his voice soft yet compelling, captivating every audience in the temple. Their souls found solace in his recitation, even though they were still far from attaining enlightenment.

        It was until the sun dipped below the horizon, and the world embraced stillness, that Wu Yu finally concluded his reading. After he bid farewell to the audience, he returned to his chamber amidst the twilight. However, as he stepped inside, he was suddenly held in a soft and warm embrace. In the dim candlelight, he discerned the figure of a naked woman, her skin immaculately white, emanating an unfamiliar fragrance.

        “Ximen Qing, where have you been?” the woman pouted in the dim corner, her voice dripping with a seductive charm, and complained, “I’ve been waiting for you for so long! I almost fell asleep.”

        “Miss Pan, Ximen Qing is the former name I have left behind. I am now known as Wu Yu,” the monk replied.
　
        “Oh dear, I don’t care about that. Wu Yu, the name of a desireless man, how dull and uninteresting. So I’ll just call you Ximen Qing,” Pan Jinlian said while her hands caressed Wu Yu’s firm chest and abdominals, teasingly brushing his skin.

        “A name is nothing but words. Call me anything as you wish, Miss Pan,” Wu Yu remained unmoved and ignored the woman’s touch, following the teachings on facing temptation. He calmly removed her hands from his body and distanced himself. Clasping his palms together respectfully, he asked, “Miss Pan, what brings you here tonight?”

        “You know exactly what brings me here.” Pan Jinlian flicked her hair, paying no mind to her completely naked form. She even gave Wu Yu a seductive wink, and said, “I have seduced you so many times, and you should know the reason: I want to know what a monk tastes like.”

        As Pan Jinlian spoke, she took the opportunity to pounce on Wu Yu. Yet, the man, sensing her intentions, effortlessly evaded her, letting her fall back onto the bed.

        With his hand running the mala beads, Wu Yu sincerely advised, “Sensual desire only brings about distractions and turmoil. It would be best for you to refrain from indulging in it, Miss Pan.”

        “Tut! I can’t believe you just told a succubus who lives by sensual pleasures to give up on desire. What you said was nothing but asking me to throw myself against a wall and die!” Pan Jinlian was a succubus, a demon who lived by consuming desires. She caught sight of Wu Yu gathering herbs the last time she ate. She was immediately mesmerized by the monk’s appearance, and thus attempted to seduce him repeatedly, but she never succeeded.

        Nevertheless, the monk’s rejection had not dampened her desire, but quite the contrary. The more Wu Yu remained detached and uninterested, the more she longed for him, especially when she sensed that he was not entirely unaffected by her presence. Every time he looked at her, she saw a flicker of desire and intense affection in his deep and enigmatic eyes. Yet, there seemed to be an inexplicable karmic tie that constrained him, forcing him to suppress and abandon his feelings.

        Normally, Pan Jinlian would have never wasted her time like this if it were another man. However, it was Ximen Qing, a man who had captivated her so deeply that she could not resist but repeatedly attempted to seduce him.

        “There’s no way you’re truly desireless!” Pan Jinlian lightly bit her crimson lip in contemplation. 
        As unintentional as her movement seemed, it was more enticing than simple and direct seduction. Even an abstinent man like Wu Yu could not help but lay his eyes on her enchantingly fiery lips for a second, but he quickly lowered his eyes so she did not notice his unusual gaze.

        Only Ximen Qing knew that he was no longer desireless.

        Pan Jinlian lifted her gaze, cunningly looking at Wu Yu, and flashed a flirtatious smile, “You avoid desire because you have never experienced its wonders. But I can show you how delightful it can be!”

        After speaking, Pan Jinlian clapped her hands twice. Two muscular naked men emerged from the shadows. One embraced her from behind, leaning down to kiss her earlobe, while the other knelt at her feet, starting to kiss his way up from her instep. The atmosphere in the simple chamber instantly became imbued with pure sensuality.

        A glimpse of ferocity flashed through Wu Yu’s eyes as he witnessed the erotic spectacle, but he quickly suppressed it. To calm the sudden surge of resentment in his heart, he clasped his palms together and began reciting the profound canonical scriptures.

        Form is no different from formlessness;  formlessness is no different from form.
“Listen Sariputra, form itself is emptiness, and emptiness itself is form. Form is no different from formlessness; formlessness is no different from form. The same is true of feelings, perceptions, mental formations, and consciousness. Listen Sariputra, all phenomena bear the mark of emptiness; their true nature is the nature of no birth no death, no being no non-being, no defilement no purity, no increasing no decreasing…”

        As Wu Yu chanted, he infused the power within him into his voice and channeled it into the bodies of the two men, forcefully suppressing their burning desires.

        “Why aren’t you two aroused?!” Pan Jinlian, unsatisfied with the men’s lack of reaction, became enraged and kicked the two flustered men away. “You useless idiots!”

        The two men, fearing Pan Jinlian’s wrath, fled the chamber in a panic.

        “Miss Pan, please refrain from foul words and violent actions for they result in bad karma,” Wu Yu calmly advised in a gentle voice. However, only he knew that his composure was merely a mask. Nonetheless, Pan Jinlian, who was unaware of his swirling emotions, was once again infuriated by his abstinence. Her eyes burned with rage, her teeth clenched.

        “Dang it! He still rejects me after I’ve put so much effort into seducing him… No! I won’t give up! I swear I will make him mine, even if it means to risk my life!”

        “I, Pan Jinlian, only obey my desires, may it be doing evil deeds or indulging in debauchery! I will get what I want even if I have to sacrifice everything!” Before Pan Jinlian finished speaking, she opened the pendant on her neck and swallowed the pill hidden inside. Wu Yu, sensing something amiss, tried to stop her, but it was already too late.

        Pan Jinlian’s action shattered Wu Yu’s mask of composure, bringing his rare ferocious and menacing side to the light. With his eyes narrowed and filled with anger, he sternly questioned her, “What have you swallowed?” 

        “Mmm…” Under the effects of the pill, Pan Jianlian’s face flushed, her body moistened, and her voice became tender, like a delicate and enticing flower waiting to be fertilized. “What I’ve swallowed… Mmm… is a specially crafted love potion from my family. The only way to heal me is to satisfy my carnal desires. Otherwise, I will perish within a day… Haha, you stupid monk! If you don’t save me, you become a murderer. But if you save me, you break your rules of abstinence. How would you choose?”

        “You—” Wu Yu felt his anger intensify upon hearing Pan Jinlian’s answer. He silently recited sutras to calm his mind, only to find it was useless. Suppressing his emotions, he asked once again, “Why would you do that? You want to die?”

        “Yes.” Pan Jinlian walked up to Wu Yu and stopped at a distance so close that their breaths intertwined. Her warmth lingered around Wu Yu’s robes, provoking the desires and wicked thoughts buried deep in his mind.

        “That’s who I am—arrogant, licentious, unrestrained—a witch who embodies all forbidden fruits… Now, do you want me?”

        Wu Yu remained silent, his gaze locked with Pan Jinlian’s. Ripples began to spread across his emotionless eyes, and eventually transformed into mountainous waves that submerged his rationality and beliefs.

        “...You will regret this,” Wu Yu hoarsely spoke as he forcefully grabbed Pan Jinlian’s wrists and pushed her against the wall. He hungrily kissed her detestable yet tender lips, releasing all the torment he had endured, and unleashing his repressed desires.

        With a snap, Wu Yu’s mala beads broke amidst their osculation, scattering over the floor. The temperature in the chamber rose as their shadows intertwined in the faint candlelight while falling into the whirlpool of sensual enjoyment.</p>
