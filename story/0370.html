        <h1>Court of Scorpio - Alma</h1>
        <p>
                Alma was always certain about herself.  She killed numerous warriors with her scorpion tail and rejoiced over her victory every time she saw the agonized face of the warriors controlled by Demons.  The blade of the executioner never ceased to kill, not until Alma met a warrior with beast claws like her.  He surprisingly fended off her deadly blow.  It was then that Alma learned the conspiracy behind it — the general was not only purging demons, but also ousting their dissidents.  Alma did not believe in the warrior’s words, yet he dodged the attack of her scorpion tail, knocking her down with his giant claws, and disappeared in the shadows.

        Alma reported to the Gods about what she had seen, and asked about what the warrior had said.  However, the general suddenly attacked her, claiming that she had fallen into the hands of Demons.  Though Alma managed to execute him later, her scorpion tail was snapped off, leaving her on the verge of death.  Without knowing the truth, other Gods regarded her as a traitor.  Only the Astralists of the Scorpio Court were aware of her twinge of guilt within her hatred.  Attracted by Alma’s strong emotions, the Astralists reconstructed her scorpion tail with the power of constellations.  Then, Alma fought with the power granted by the Astralists, and was given the title as the Court of Scorpio.  The Astralists asked Alma to continue her mission with her undying will, that she would annihilate all corrupted ones of the realm of gods.</p>
