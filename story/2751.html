        <h1>Divine Maiden - Idun</h1>
        <p>        In flying snow, a scrawny orphan was stumbling down the street with a rag being her only clothing. Starved and cold, she walked on the ground barefoot; every step was a prickle for her. She thought that she might just as well collapse and let the wind and snow burry her. Just as she was about to fall, a pair of warm arms caught her.

        ‘From today on, you’re Idun.’

        After taking the orphan home, Angrboda gave her the name Idun and took care of her. This was the first time Idun knew the warmth from others. The two lived in a chalet. During their stay, Angrboda taught her all kinds of knowledge.

        However, the more Angrboda taught Idun, the more she felt that something was wrong. Until one day, Idun found Angrboda packing.

        ‘Are you… leaving me too?’ Hanging her head low, Idun said in a low voice that broke Angrboda’s heart.

        ‘I have to leave, to find a power from ancient times. This is my fate… It is the only way to keep my clan's people from war.’

        Idun tugged at Angrboda’s sleeve and said that she wanted to go find the ancient power with her. Yet, she was still reluctant to bring Idun with her, even she put on the weeps. The journey to finding the ancient power was too dangerous that Angrboda couldn’t even ensure her own safety, let alone bring a little girl with her.

        For Idun’s desperate pleas, she finally relented and stated that Idun could go with her on the condition that she passed her trial: she must walk through a road called the Path of Trial and pick a purple flower that only grew at the end of the path.

        At first, Idun thought that it was an easy test. Yet, she could only return to the starting point no matter how hard she try. She still wasn’t able to pass the test until the day when Angrboda took her backpack and set off. Watching Angrboda leave, Idun swore that she would catch up with her one day.

        On the Path of Trial, where trail marks would disappear the next day, one could only return to the starting point if he or she walked blindly. To find the clues about how to pass the Path of Trial, Idun started reading Angrboda’s notes and her library. She began to understand the world bit by bit through books; through her notes, she knew that the Path of Trial was actually a giant and magical maze.

        In order to pass the test, Idun went to the Path of Trial every day. Since there was no shortcut, she tried time after time and learned all the changes and patterns little by little from every mistake she made on the road. With her encounter on the path, Idun gradually integrated all the knowledge she had learned…

        As the days went by, Idun grew up—from a little girl to a maiden. Every year, Angrboda would come back to the chalet and spend the winter with her. Then she would leave by the time the snow melted. It was a gracious time that the two enjoyed and treasured. Idun’s heart wrenched when she saw Angrboda’s wounds she got from her journey alone, so she worked even harder to solve the Path of Trial.

        For years Idun had not talked about accompanying Angrboda on her journey, she thought that she had given up. That year, Angrboda packed up alone as usual when the snow melted. Just as she was about to set off, she found Idun standing before her with a backpack on her back and a bouquet of purple flowers in her hands.

        Looking at each other, the two simultaneously laughed. Then they went on their journey to find the ancient power.

        That memory was the only one that Idun had never forgotten no matter how long time passed. Perhaps it was also the thing that kept her on the right track in the torrent of time.

        Just then, the only wish Idun had was to follow Angrboda closely. Little did she know that Angrboda would still leave her for good one day…</p>
