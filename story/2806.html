        <h1>Claws of Shades - Lynx</h1>
        <p>        Obeying Khaos’ order, Lynx went to assassinate John, the Court of Cancer, whom she found in a volcanic field. She seized the moment and tried to kill him, only to be captured by the latter. Lynx attempted to beg John to free her by giving him a guilt trip with her adorable eyes, yet he brought her up to the volcano instead.

        There were various powerful beasts living in the volcanic field. As they avoided the beasts, the climb took more days than they had expected. Being hog-tied by a rope and carried on John’s shoulder, Lynx had silently cursed John a thousand times during the bumpy trip.

        ‘I really don’t know anything. I’m just a victim of Khaos so it’s pointless to take me with you. How about you just let me go?’ Lynx said pitifully.

        ‘Shut up. I don’t trust a word from you,’ said John coldly without casting her a glance.

        ‘But I’m no use to you, so just let me go, please.’ Lynx persuaded John with her round watery eyes and flattery. 

        ‘No, that’s not exactly right—at least I can use you as a decoy when I encounter a beast.’

        ‘You!’

        “This man is impossible! What is wrong with him?! How could he be so unfeeling to my cuteness… Anyhow, I am going to find a chance to kill him!”

        So Lynx began to observe John carefully along the way. The longer she observed, the more she felt frustrated. John knocked down the beasts in the volcanic field easily with his excellent fighting skills; not even the most menacing beast could leave a scratch on his black armor. However, there was one thing that Lynx found ludicrous—John only repelled the beasts and hardly killed any of them.

        To Lynx, the world had always run by the law of the jungle—weak prey never lived long. Showing mercy to the beasts could lead to retaliation in the future. Nonetheless, that would work in Lynx’s favor since she had been hoping for nothing but John’s death. It was just that her wish never came true.

        The closer they got to the top of the volcano, the more anxious Lynx was. Although Khaos never told her the reason why he wanted John dead, her instinct told her that it was all connected to the machine on the top.

        “I don’t have much time left. Khaos is gonna kill me if I fail my mission. Holy—— Why is it so hot in here?” thought Lynx with sweat running down her forehead, which fell to the ground and evaporated. As Lynx looked around from John’s shoulder, she found that they had come to a small cliff where she could see the flowing lava down below.

        “Oh right, the lava! No matter how hard his armor is, he surely can’t survive the lava!” With a sinister grin flashing across her face, Lynx began to come up with a plan to make John fall into the lava.

        After putting up a tent to rest, John took out that unmelting ice again and started examining it.

        “He has been holding on to that ice along the way… If that ice falls, he will definitely try to catch it and that will be my chance to kill him.” Picking the right moment, Lynx summoned the chaotic power inside her and attacked her own body! Then blood spurted out of her mouth.

        ‘Arghhh! It hurts!’　

        Hearing the Lynx’s groan and seeing her rolling on the ground, John walked to her with a frown, only to find an energy running amok in her body.

        Just when John put down his guard to help her, Lynx broke away the rope with all her might and snatched the ice from his hand. Then she leaped toward the edge of the cliff with the ice in her arms.

        Just as Lynx had expected, John immediately jumped off the cliff. Falling to the lava with the ice in her arms, Lynx could not help but feel triumphant when she saw the anxious look on his face which brought a wicked smile to her face.

        ‘Die!’ Lynx let go of the ice, forcing John to catch the ice in mid-air. As she conjured her power, a blinding purple light appeared around her legs. Like a flash of purple lightning, she then leaped in the air, stepped on John’s back, snatched the ice again, and climbed back up to the cliff.

        After Lynx had gotten back to the ground, she looked at the ice in her arms and thought, “If I bring this cube of ice with me, maybe Khaos will reward me with more power or even set me free…”

        Recalling the taste of freedom she had as the leader of the stray cat group, Lynx could not help but dream about her future. Just as she was about to turn around and leave, a blade of wind attacked her from the rear——

        Someone kicked the ice in Lynx’s hands into the air and caught it before it fell to the ground. Lynx looked back, only to find that John was standing behind her composedly.

        ‘You—— How could this be possible?!’ Lynx exclaimed.

        ‘I have never let my guard down over you from the beginning, so of course, I was well prepared for your scheme after seeing you jump off the cliff.’ John nonchalantly showed her the grappling hooks in his hands.

        ‘Dang it! Give that ice to me!’ Filled with rage, Lynx conjured a giant cat’s phantom with her chaotic power to attack John.

        “I wanted to see if it could change, but it seems impossible now.” Letting out a soft sigh, John no longer hid his power. As he channeled his astralist power into his right hand, he tore apart the phantom with a wave of his hand and a burst of radiant light. Then, he charged at Lynx with his other hand.

        By quick reflex, Lynx kicked her feet and jumped to the edge of the cliff to dodge the attack. Then she said victoriously, ‘Humph! You missed—— Hmm?”

        When Lynx was halfway through finishing her sentence, she suddenly felt a tremor under her feet, which gave her a sense of foreboding. However, it was already too late—the cliff edge began to collapse at the unbearable impact of their fight.

        Lynx fell into the boiling lava with the debris and disappeared into the vivid burning orange before she could even let out a scream.

        ‘What comes around goes around, huh?’ Looking at the flowing lava, John showed a derisive smile. Then he walked away, heading toward his destination…</p>
