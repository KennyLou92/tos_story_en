        <h1>Fugue of Silence - Bach</h1>
        <p>
                Severed limbs and shattered remains lay scattered across the dry grass. The dead’s eyes remained wide in eternal horror as countless grotesque, misshapen creatures feasted ravenously on their bodies.

        It was a battlefield of utter carnage. Amidst all the sprawling corpses, however, a lone boy survived, holding a bloodied instrument in his arms, his eyes wide with shock as he blankly surveyed the gruesome devastation around him.

        “How… How did we come to this…?”

        The boy was a Consonia, a young Melodist who had gone on his very first mission with the orchestra to exterminate ferocious monsters that had invaded a border planet.

        It should have been an easy assignment, one that was common to the Melodists. However, something went terribly wrong this time, and at the heart of this tragedy was none other than the conductor himself.

        The conductor had long grown weary of the orchestra’s unchanging musical style. He had petitioned the principal conductor many times, begging for reform, but his requests were repeatedly denied. Determined to prove his point, he chose to adopt a new style during this mission. The results were, of course, catastrophic.

        ‘I… I only followed the Conductor’s instructions… But why did we end up like this?’ The boy’s mind spiraled into the depths of confusion and despair. The conductor’s whimsical decision threw the entire orchestra into chaos. The sudden change of style disrupted the Melodists’ rhythm and affected their performance, which eventually weakened the magical barrier they conjured with their music. Like a swarm of bees drawn to the scent of honey, some ravenous monsters poured in through the cracks in the barrier and attacked the defenseless Melodists.

        With each Melodist’s demise, the barrier fractured further. More monsters surged through the gaps and began their hunt, chasing and slaughtering the remaining Melodists one after another. Although the conductor fought desperately, trying to turn the tide, his efforts proved futile. In the end, he sacrificed his life to protect the boy.

        With the conductor’s death, the orchestra fell apart, and the battlefield became the monsters’ feast. Miraculously, the boy lived thanks to the conductor’s dying efforts. He survived as the last member of the orchestra.

        However, miracles are ephemeral. The monsters eventually discovered the boy. They encircled him, closing in from all sides. In that moment of bleak despair, the boy closed his eyes and surrendered to his fate.

        Yet death did not come. Two summoners from the Heptara Unies—who happened to pass through this desolate planet—saved him from the clutches of death.

        He survived, but at a cost far worse than death. The terror of that day had been etched on his memory forever, festering into a fear he could never dispel.

        For years afterward, the once confident boy continued to live in terror and confusion. Eventually, he grew up and turned into a withdrawn and taciturn man who madly indulged himself in music—a desperate attempt to flee the cruel and hopeless memories haunting him.

        The tragedy of the conductor’s failed reform scarred the boy and shaped him into a stubborn and uncompromising Melodist who only obeyed tradition. After paying an immeasurable price, he became the principal conductor, entrusted with the fate of the Court of Music.

        ‘Reforms only invite catastrophe. Preserving harmony is the only and absolute principle we should follow.’

        The boy—now the principal conductor—Bach,  blinded by the fear of his haunting past, clung stubbornly to this belief. He refused to face the mistakes of history. Little did he know that his extreme rigidity would lead the Consonias into an even greater calamity…
