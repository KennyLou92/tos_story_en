        <h1>Skull-culating Masseuse - Lady White Bone</h1>
        <p>        As the sun descended behind the towering mountains, its waning glow bathed the mountainous landscape in a soft and ethereal radiance. A weary woodsman, shouldering bundles of firewood, hastened his descent from a mountain. His mouth, covered by a full beard, moved as he muttered to himself.

        “Gosh! If only I hadn’t fallen asleep after eating so much! It’s getting dark. I have to hurry, or else that wretched woman will surely scold me!”

        A shudder coursed through the bearded man as he thought of his fierce wife, prompting him to quicken his pace. Yet, an agonizing pang gripped his lumbar region when he had only gone for a few steps, causing him to grimace and stop.

        “Ouch! My back! It’s killing me!” The bearded man hurriedly leaned against a boulder and began gently kneading his aching back. “It must be from that time I strained my back chopping the firewood. I really have to ask my wife to give me a massage when I get back… Huh? Why is there a massage parlor?”

        The bearded man raised his head, only to see a wooden cottage in the middle of the forest. As twilight draped its dusky veil, a candle flicked inside the cottage, casting a warm and amber radiance that set the cottage aglow amidst the lush greenery. Compelled by an irresistible sense of curiosity, the bearded man walked toward the cottage stealthily until he reached the window and peered through it—

        “Are you looking for something, Sir?”
        “WOAH! A-a ghost!”

        Suddenly, a melodious voice sounded behind the man, eliciting a startled cry from him. Recoiling in fear, the man tumbled backward and fell to the ground. Quivering, he turned and looked only to be mesmerized by the woman before him. She held an unparalleled allure,  her form graceful as a swan, her complexion reminiscent of snow, her features a tapestry of enchantment, and her very presence exuding an ethereal aura.

        “Are you alright?” the woman asked.

        “I-I’m fine, just startled,” the bearded man replied, rising to his feet while dusting off the soil on his clothes. Hoping to redeem his image, he continued, “But I never thought someone would be living in such a remote forest.”

        “I find solace in solitude,” the woman chuckled, “Besides, opening a shop in the city is quite costly. That’s why I moved here.”

        “A shop?” the man asked, puzzled.

        “Yes. I’m actually a masseuse, specializing in relieving body pain through massages… Oh! How about you be my first customer? I can give you a free massage as an apology for startling you earlier,” she suggested, her voice tinged with sweetness.

        “But my wife is waiting for me at home…” the man hesitated, yet his gaze involuntarily wandered toward the captivating woman. It was clear that he was wavering.

        “It won’t take long. I promise you will get home soon enough,” the woman reassured him, putting her hands on his arm. Her supple bosom brushed against him, accompanied by a subtle fragrance that enthralled his senses. Unknowingly, the man followed her into the wooden cottage.

        “Please lie down on the bed, and let me ease the tension in your muscles,” she cooed.

        “Alright, alright,” said the man, who obediently positioned himself upon the bed, exhilarated by the woman’s dulcet tones. He felt the gentle touch of her hands gliding across his body, relieving the tightness in his muscles with just the right amount of pressure. The man could not help but hum in contentment, showering her with fervent praise, “You’re really good at this… Mmm… So good… oh… Why am I feeling… drowsy… so tired…”

        Gradually, the man began to feel an overwhelming weariness, as if the essence of his vitality was being drained away. His eyelids grew heavy and he struggled to keep them open. It was then that he finally sensed something amiss. Summoning his waning strength, he turned his gaze only to behold a horrifying sight—the enchanting beauty that had stolen his heart moments ago had been replaced by a skeletal frame.

        “Wh… A… A… mon…monster!” the man gasped, his voice trembling in fear, yet weakened to feeble murmurs.

        “Excuse me? Did you just call me a monster?” said the skeleton, her mouth spewing sharp rebukes, “I am Lady White Bones, the demon with the fairest bones of all.”

        “Please… Please…don’t kill me…” the man tearfully pleaded, his sorrowful eyes contrasting sharply with his rugged and wild countenance.

        Lady White Bones disdainfully spat, her words filled with scorn as she spoke, “Don’t worry. Not only will I spare your life, but I will also take good care of you. That way, I can have a constant supply of yang energy to nourish my bones.”

        With every word spoken, Lady White Bones greedily absorbed nearly eighty percent of the man’s yang energy. Carrying the feeble man, she took him to the farthest corner of the wooden cottage. As she opened the door, several men were revealed, some seated, others reclining, all on the verge of exhaustion, much like the bearded man.

        “Take some rest. I will see you tomorrow, at the same hour,” she said, tossing the man inside the room before sealing the door. Yet, as the latch clicked shut, a young man’s shout came from outside.

        “Oh, a massage parlor! That’s fantastic! I could really use a good massage to relieve the pain in my body since that wicked He Xian’gu forced me to do the heavy work for her two days ago,” the man said.

        ‘So many men are here today… Well, one more prey means one more source of yang energy, and that will only make my bones even more beautiful,’ Lady White Bones thought. Then, she tapped into her powers, conjuring flesh to enshroud her body. In the blink of an eye, the skeleton transformed back into her original form as a beautiful woman.

        “Hey! Is anybody here?” the young man implored, thumping on the door impatiently.

        “Coming,” Lady White Bones responded with haste, opening the door to reveal a tall and comely young man. Her heart fluttered with anticipation as she thought to herself, ‘Oh, another exquisite prey.’

        “Are you here for a massage? Please, come right in,” Lady White Bones walked forward, intending to put her hands around the young man’s arm. However, the young man, disregarding courtesy, halted her advance with a palm against her face, “Keep your distance. You…kind of smell.”

        “You—” Lady White Bones’s anger surged as she heard the young man, yet she suppressed it. Forcing a smile, she said, “Oh, you have a keen nose.  I happened to step on dog excrement just moments ago. I rushed to cleanse myself, but alas, a trace of the scent may still linger.”

        “Dog excrement...” The young man cast a disdainful glance upon Lady White Bones, then waved dismissively. “Never mind. Since a massage only involves the use of hands, I shall reluctantly endure it.”

        “…How forgiving, Sir,” Lady White Bones beamed, her smile distorting her features in an enigmatic way. She gestured to the wooden bed inside the cottage, her voice coy. “Please, lie down on the bed, Sir.”

        Before Lady White Bones could finish her words, the young man swiftly strode over and positioned himself on the bed, then turned his head to look at her and implored, “Hurry up. Don’t keep a Xian… I mean me waiting.”

        “Yes, yes, coming right up,” Lady White Bones replied, upholding her facade of smiles. She hastened to the bedside, and as the youth turned his head, oblivious to her presence, she relinquished her smile, glaring malevolently at his back as she thought, ‘I didn’t want to kill anyone, but this insolent bastard’s words were just so distasteful. I shall drain the very essence of his yang energy!’

        Unleashing her powers, Lady White Bones revealed her true form. She stretched all her bones to seize the youth upon the bed, yet unexpectedly, they collided with something hard—several long swords materialized, their blades suffused with Xian energy.

        “Humph! I knew you were the wicked demon that has been capturing men nearby,” said the man, controlling the swords to repel Lady White Bones with a wave of his finger.

        “You’re not a mortal!”

        “Indeed, I’m Lü Dongbin, a Xian from the Heavenly Kingdom. I have been tasked with subduing the demon that kidnaps innocent men.” As soon as Lü Dongbin snapped his fingers, an array of swords manifested and surrounded Lady White Bones. He then continued, “How dare you use massage as a means to ensnare those who suffer from bone pain. Yet, in deference to your abstention from bloodshed, I shall punish you with the same torment so that you know the pain that gnaws at the core!”

        Afterward, Lü Dongbin sealed Lady White Bones within the crevices of two large stones and released all the imprisoned men. Little did he know that his punishment would trigger a peculiar inclination of Lady White Bones in the days to come…</p>
