        <h1>Timid Prodigy - Sapphire</h1>
        <p>Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 12

At lunch break, Diamond rushed to the library adjacent to the campus. Entering the building, he climbed up the ladder to the top of a bookshelf.

Curling herself up, Sapphire was slumbering inside a narrow space. When the sunlight shone over her, it became a captivating azure reflection. Diamond was carried away, and he didn’t even realize that Sapphire had woken up already.

“Why are you standing here?” Sapphire was being bossy as always.

“What? Oh right!” Returning to reality, Diamond gave a book to Sapphire and said, “I’m here to return the book you lent me yesterday.”

“You’ve finished it already?” 

When Sapphire was reaching out, a gentle male voice spoke down on the ground, “Sapphire? Are you here?”

The expression on Sapphire changed in a split second. Her gaze was filled with joy, which was a completely different attitude towards Diamond.

“I’m here!” Sapphire shouted out loud rarely. Next, she kept her voice low and yelled at Diamond, “get out of the way!”

As soon as Diamond stepped aside, Sapphire dashed to Aquamarine, the boy standing at doorstep, as if a bee was drawn to honey.

“I figured that you’re here,” said Aquamarine, scanning Sapphire with a smile. “I’m happy to know that you’re doing great.”

Aquamarine, who looked younger than Sapphire, was actually her uncle. All minerelves were born to have a mature body. Minerelves’ body pieces would peel off during their aging process, causing the decrease in body size as they grew older. That explained the opposite aging appearance of minerelves in the human perspective.

“Uncle, do you wanna have lunch with me today?” Hope was sparkling in Sapphire’s eyes , but it went in vain very soon.

Shaking his head, Aquamarine replied, “I’m sorry. I have something to do later, and I’ll be leaving soon.”

“Is that so…” Sapphire dropped her shoulders out of disappointment, but she hadn’t given up yet. “Then when will you be free?”

“Mmm...I can’t be sure either. I’ve been occupied by preparation work of my wedding. Rhodochrosite was too impatient for that and she left all the work for me——Ouch!” Aquamarine was cut off by a strong elbow blow. He turned around and scowl at the attacker——Rhodochrosite, his fiancee.

“You lunatic! Why did you hit me?”

“When I came here to fetch you for the teachers’ meeting, I heard you talking behind my back! Of course I need to teach you a lesson.”

“I was telling the truth, not gossip.”

“What!” Rhodochrosite attempted to hit him again, but Aquamarine didn’t fall for the same trick twice. Restrained by Aquamarine, Rhodochrosite failed to break free no matter how hard she struggled.

“I’m leaving,” said Aquamarine. He freed a hand to stroke Sapphire’s head, pampering her like a caretaker to a youth. “Don’t push yourself. Tell me if you ever have a bad day.”

Sapphire nodded. As she watched Aquamarine and Rhodochrosite leaving, the two elves were still fighting, but their hands never let go of each other too.

“Why is my heart hurting like hell? Am I dying?” Tears swelled up in Sapphire’s eyes. As she dropped the tears, they left a vague trail on her face.

It hurt Diamond to see her in heartbreak, but he was clueless to help.

“She’s devastated...I wanna do something, but I’ll throw up whenever I have body contact with girls...Maybe I can do it indirectly...Let’s take a shot!”

Standing next to Sapphire, Diamond pulled her close to let her lean on his shoulder, who didn’t reject. Even with the school uniform between the two, the warmth of Diamond did help soothing Sapphire’s heartbreak a little.

“This is brilliant. I won’t feel sick with a layer of clothes between us,” Diamond thought. 

Glancing at Sapphire who shut her eyes, Diamond asked cautiously, “Do you...like him?”

“Like...It’s not that simple...He is my world,” Sapphire mumbled in trance, and she continued, “my parents were distant in my childhood because of work. It’s uncle who have always been there for me. When I was sick in bed, he read me bedtime stories. He takes care of me, holds my hand when I was in pain...I feel happy whenever I’m with him.”

Sapphire lifted her head up, with her lucid eyes after cleansing by tears. 

“Can you tell me what is the feeling I have towards him?”

“...I don’t know either…” Diamond, who had no romantic experience, answered honestly, “but I’m sure that he’s very important to you.”

“Important...You’re right...Even if it’s not the way I want, I still wish nothing but the best for him.”

Sapphire bitterly smiled and continued, “maybe this is my karma after my nasty attitude to everyone, including you. I think I’ll never be happy ever again.”

“Impossible!” Diamond disapproved loudly. Suddenly, an idea swept across his mind, and he said it out loud immediately, “how about joining my club?”

“Your club?”

“Yes. The voyager club.” Diamond spread his arms wide, as if hugging the air. 

“A big world is lying outside the walls. There must be something that can make you happy.”

“How can I find it on my own——”

“You’re not alone. I’m with you,” said Diamond as he pointed at himself. “Let’s find it together!”

At this moment, a ray of sunlight shone onto Diamond. The dazzling reflection carried Sapphire away, who smiled genuinely this time.

“Sure. Let’s do it!”

Since that day, Sapphire had escaped from the narrow world she used to live in, to the boundless horizon...</p>
