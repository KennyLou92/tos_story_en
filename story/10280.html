        <h1>Intrepid Liberator - Caesar</h1>
        <p>
        Date of Birth: 12 Jul

An Elemental Beast.
He was once the inspector of beasts.
He died thirty years ago in the Rust Plague incident with his name going down in history as one of the great Heroes of Rust.

As an inspector, he had a strong sense of justice and zero tolerance of wrongful machinations. Placing a high value on friendships and his clan, he often put himself in a dilemma of loyalty and righteousness.

Yet, he later changed his way of looking at things after the House incident, in which he learned to hide his true feelings with artful words.</p>
