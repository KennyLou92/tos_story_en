        <p>        [b][i]Battlecruiser Ohio Log Entry: Day 183 of the 101st Year

        Encountered an Eldus who wandered across the cosmos. Initiating communication. Extending an invitation to become the dedicated Guide.

        Result: unsuccessful. Rejected for the 99th time. Initiating the 100th Guide search operation.[/i][/b]

        A majestic battleship sailed through the vast expanse of the universe. It was Ohio, a battle cruiser, flying on her routine patrol, tirelessly searching for someone who could become her Guide.

        “Distress signal from another battle cruiser detected,” an emotionless female voice suddenly echoed in the empty control cockpit, “A potential Guide identified in the battlecruiser, proceed to rescue.”

        Ohio altered her course, heading toward the source of the distress signal. As she sailed on, she came across a ship similar to herself, seemingly teetering on the brink of imbalance for unknown reasons, perilously close to colliding with a celestial body.

        “Unstable magnetic fields detected. Execute rescue operation at maximum distance,” Ohio’s commanding voice resounded. As Ohio came to a halt, six sturdy metallic cables were swiftly ejected from her sides, their sharp hooks precisely latching onto the floundering battle cruiser, effectively preventing it from colliding with the celestial body.

        Realizing Ohio’s assistance, the distressed battleship promptly shut down all power systems to ensure they would not hinder the rescue, which allowed Ohio to guide it away from the magnetic fields and avert a catastrophic accident.

        Once they reached a safe zone, Ohio opened her boarding ramp, signaling for the rescued crew to disembark.

        A moment later, an energetic young girl emerged from the rescued battleship. Her name was Scáthach, the dedicated guide of the battle cruiser, Montana.

        Over a hundred years ago, a series of battlecruisers and their assigned Guides were created for the sake of universal security, only to be deemed too powerful and advocated for destruction. Though they managed to escape with the help of a researcher, they were subsequently hunted down and remained fugitives until recently, when the Heptara Unies overturned the decision and granted them basic rights.

        However, there were still voices in the world calling for the eradication of battlecruisers. In response, Scáthach and Montana embarked on a journey to safeguard universal security, hoping to prove their worth and change the world’s perception through their actions.

        Their journey was fraught with danger, but fortune seemed to favor them, as it did on this occasion.

        Since Montana’s android was not allowed to leave the battleship, he wired Scáthach up with a mini communication device to provide her support.

        “Monty, I-I’m going in,” Scáthach said nervously, swallowing hard as she gazed at the empty cabin. She then cautiously stepped into the vessel. 

        Fortunately, the cabin was safer and more aesthetically pleasing than she had imagined. It was adorned with greenery, thriving under the battlecruiser’s small-scale provision of elements.

        “Monty, Monty, this is fascinating! The leaves close when I touch them! Can we have some on our ship?” Scáthach played with a clump of foliage in a corner, marveling at how its leaves folded upon contact, captivated by her new discovery.

        “Thank you for liking it,” Ohio’s voice responded, preempting Montana.

        “Woah!” Startled, Scáthach stood upright and expressed her gratitude toward the empty cabin, “Th-thank you for saving us earlier.”

        “No need to thank me.  It was a small effort on my part. Besides, I have a favor to ask.”

        “Huh? What is it? We’ll do our best to help!” said Scáthach, clenching her fists and brimming with enthusiasm.

        “It’s simple,” Ohio said. Instantly, a female android appeared before Scáthach. She opened her eyes and looked at Scáthach with a tranquil and unwavering gaze as if what she was about to say was an ordinary request.

        “Can you be my Guide?”

        “...What?!”  However, in Scáthach’s eyes, Ohio’s request appeared as tumultuous waves crashing upon her. “No! I can’t! I already have Monty! How can I become the guide of another battlecruiser? That would be a dereliction of my duties as a Guide!”

        “Is that so? What a pity,” Ohio replied, though her reaction and tone were absolutely calm, devoid of any disappointment as if she had known the answer.

        “But… You saved us. I’m so sorry that I can’t return that favor.”

        “No, there’s no need to apologize. You’re not the first to say no. In fact, you’re the hundredth one who refused to become my Guide.”

        “The hundredth?!” Scáthach exclaimed, then tilted her head in confusion, pondering the situation. “Wait a minute, every battlecruiser should have a dedicated Guide, right? What happened to your original Guide?”

        “My original Guide… Error… Error… Error… Error…”

        “Wh-what’s happening?” Ohio’s android suddenly became unstable, glitching uncontrollably. Scáthach grew panicked, but fortunately, Montana urgently spoke up, “Her program is malfunctioning! Quickly, connect my terminal to hers!”
　
        “O-okay!” Scáthach hurriedly removed the device hanging from her neck and connected it to Ohio. Immediately, a burst of light shimmered frequently, but it gradually calmed down as Ohio’s android stabilized, reverting to its original form as a young girl.

        “Ar-are you okay?” Scáthach asked, her face filled with concern.

        “Yes, thanks to Montana’s assistance in terminating the erroneous program.”

        “Haha! I know! Monty is just amazing!” Scáthach giggled.

        “...Why are you the one celebrating?” Montana sighed. He spoke to Ohio earnestly, “When I linked with your system just now, I discovered that someone has overwritten your memory database. It should be the reason that caused your program error.”

        “...My memories have been overwritten?” asked Ohio, whose expression revealed confusion.

        “Yes, and I can help you restore them. The only problem is do you want me to?” Montana asked seriously, “Those memories may not be safe, perhaps it is why someone deleted them.”

        Ohio fell silent for a moment, then lifted her head resolutely and said, “Please restore them. Regardless of the risk, I want all my memories back because they’re still a part of me, even if they are dangerous.”

        “Alright, leave it to me,” Montana agreed, once again connecting to Ohio’s system. It took more time to recover Ohio’s memory database, but eventually, Montana managed to retrieve the erased memories.

        Battlecruiser Ohio Log Entry: Day 309 of the 58th Year

        Loading visual records— 

        In the greenhouse on Ohio, a handsome young male machina sat in an armchair by the floor-to-ceiling window, surrounded by blooming platycodon grandiflorus. Complemented by the twinkling stars outside the window, they created a mesmerizing and enchanting scene.

        The young machina gazed at the breathtaking view, a bittersweet smile tugging at his lips. Yet, his graceful features were now marred by the peculiar purple discolorations on his face—a symptom of cosmic magnetic contamination.

        “How beautiful…” the machina murmured, intoxicated by the sight. He attempted to rise from the armchair, longing to approach the window. Yet, he stumbled forward due to his corroded legs. Fortunately, an android, in the form of a young girl, steadied him before he fell onto the floor.

        “Thank you, Ohio.”

        “Cichol, you shouldn’t be walking given your physical condition,” Ohio said with a strained voice.

        “But I won’t have another chance to walk if I don’t do it now,” Cichol replied, gently brushing his hand against Ohio’s cheek, his voice filled with a sense of sadness, “Yet, of everything that I’ll miss, you’re the one that I’ll miss the most, Ohio. The rest of this journey will be yours alone.”

        “...No, my journey will come to an end as well if you’re gone.”

        “Ohio, you’re still as stubborn as ever,” Cichol sighed with a bitter smile. He then placed his hand on the connection endpoint at the back of Ohio’s neck, and whispered, “But I want you to live on, taking care of the flowers in my place and see the world, even if it means you’ll completely forget about me.”

        “Cichol! What are you doing—”

        Visual records ceased—

        …

        Battlecruiser Ohio Log Entry: Day 310 of the 58th Year

        Memory database modification: Successful. All records pertaining to Guide Cichol have been removed. Emotional system exhibiting signs of backlash. Deleting harmful components, successful.

        Mission revised to “Find a new Guide”.

        …

        The immense surge of emotions collided within the Ohio system, causing her to feel the pain as every component tightened as if she was being consumed by an aching void. The indescribable wave of emotions finally transformed into a liquid that cascaded down Ohio’s cheeks, shaking Scáthach, who was standing by her side.

        “Y-y-you’re crying!” Scáthach exclaimed.

        “I…”  Ohio tried to speak only to find that her language system was unable to function properly under the tumultuous waves of emotions. It took her a while to collect herself and say, “I remember, I remember everything now.”

        Ohio turned and walked toward the depths of the cabin while Scáthach silently following behind. Together, they passed through one door after another, until they reached the very end of the upper deck. At first glance, it appeared to be an ordinary wall. However, when Ohio reached out her hand, the camouflage was lifted, revealing a tightly sealed mechanical door.

        Under Ohio’s command, the door slid open with a swish, and a gentle fragrance wafted out, captivating Scáthach’s senses. As she curiously peered inside, she was immediately mesmerized by the beautiful sight in the room: countless platycodon grandiflorus of different colors—pure white, vivid purple, soft yellow, and tender green—bloomed vigorously with their vibrant colors reflecting the brilliance of the galaxy, creating a world of kaleidoscopic hues.

        And at the center of this riot of colors, a young male machina lay peacefully on an armchair with a peaceful smile on his partly discolored yet handsome face. It was as if he were merely taking a dreamless slumber rather than being trapped in eternal rest.

        Ohio approached the armchair, her eyes filled with a mixture of endless grief and affection. She gently caressed the young machina’s cheek as she whispered softly, “Cichol, his name is Cichol. He was my first and only Guide.”

        “So he’s the one who altered your memory database,” Montana’s gentle voice was tinged with a hint of sorrow.

        “Yes,” Ohio nodded and continued, “He did it so that I could live without him.”

        “So…what do you plan to do now?” Scáthach asked cautiously, afraid to upset Ohio.

        “Don’t worry. I’m not going to self-destruct,” Ohio smiled, a smile that held both relief and nostalgia. “If I disappear,  then Cichol would truly cease to exist.”

        “Phew…” Scáthach placed a hand over her chest, relieved, and said with a heartfelt smile, “That’s good to hear.”

        “And I will stop seeking another Guide. Instead, I will continue my journey alone to seek out different types of flowers and bring them to Cichol.”

        Afterward, Ohio bid farewell to Scáthach and Montana, venturing once again into the unknown expanse of the universe.

        “Cichol, time will prove that only you are my Guide, and that you are my only one, unique platycodon grandiflorus in the whole universe.”</p>
