        <h1>Urd, Valkyrie of Past</h1>
        <p>
                Urd felt drained after mounting the Tower with her sisters again and again. When she was taking a break, the power of the elements showed her a vision that was remarkably realistic…

        Before putting on the Armor of Runes, Odin looked at Urd with inquisitive eyes.

        “You should have known that I never stop anything from happening,” Urd answered.

        “You said you never prophesy. It’s just because you never utter a word nor participate in anything.”

        The amiable smile on Urd’s face quivered a little as she sensed Odin’s reproach and ridicule of her.

        “You can’t always be a bystander,” said Odin with a smile, his gaze filled with determination.

        Urd had been always watching. To her, human history was nothing but a series of repeated tragedies. She knew exactly why Odin was smiling assuredly—he thought he had found the key to peace.

        Suddenly, she had a melancholy feeling, followed by a pang of sympathy for Odin, who was standing before her. There was an inexplicable wave in her placid heart when she thought of the tragedies the North and Odin might face.

        “If I have the power to rewrite tragedy, why should I leave it on the shelf?”

        Urd’s heart no longer lay tranquil at this thought. Instead of just looking on, she wanted to be a part of it, longing to be a pebble dropped in the great river of time.

        “Maybe the best I can do is just set off a small ripple, but at least I won’t be the bystander who stays on the shore unspoken. I’ve seen enough tragedy.”

        Gazing at Odin, Urd slowly spoke, ‘Maybe… you’re right.’

        From that day on, Urd became one of the North Alliance of her own free will, throwing herself into the war against demons. With her wisdom and prescient words, the North saw through all the demons’ schemes and got ahead of the game.

        Wind began to blow and stir the water, like a swan flapping its wings on a lake. As the war continued for years, the scale gradually tilted in favor of the North.

        On the ice field, Urd and the North’s army were rushing the base of the demon army.

        The North’s cavalry stormed the demon’s base, harvesting their enemies’ souls. Desperate to turn the tide, the demons released the Dragon of Poison that even they could not control.

        Standing on the land, the Dragon of Poison rampaged everything and perished every creature around with its virulent breath that inflicted nothing but excruciating pain polluting the air and earth.

        People died one after another. With Gungnir, the spear of eternity radiating indigo lightning, Odin charged at the nightmarishly overpowering enemy with all the warriors and cavalry of the North. Together, all of them conjured their godly powers to attack the Dragon of Poison.
 

        Screening Odin, Urd summoned a blizzard to numb the limbs of the Dragon of Poison. As Odin hurled the Gungnir into the dragon’s head, blinding flashes of lightning began to burst.

        Under the continuous attack of the lightning, the Dragon of Poison kept swinging its head in pain; its attacks became more and more frantic. After it let out a roar that echoed through the sky, it opened its mouth and spewed another venomous breath, sweeping over everyone——

        Just in the nick of time, a gigantic shield of indigo lightning rose from the frozen land as soon as Odin channeled his godly power and held out his arms.

        After a moment of stalemate between the lightning and the poisonous breath, Odin and the Dragon of Poison eventually fell to the ground with a howl, bringing a flurry of snow along with the silence of demise.

        “His purpose has been fulfilled…” Urd walked to Odin. Like a close friend, she put a hand over his eyelids and closed them so that he could forever rest in peace.

        However, the earth suddenly shook before she had a moment to grieve. Dark clouds gathered and bolts of lightning flickered across the sky like silver snakes. Then, a male voice emanated from the air.

        ‘Humans, you did great,’ said the man in a pompously arrogant tone.

        Urd and the others lifted their heads, only to find a large crack in the sky, from which numerous god soldiers slowly descended, wielding their swords at the North Alliance.

        ‘We shall rule the realm of humans!’ the man declared loudly.

        Arrows flew and blood splashed. The North Alliance, which had just defeated the demons and the Dragon of Poison, was too frazzled to withstand the god’s onslaught and their swords.

        As Urd saw the one-sided massacre in front of her, her hands could not help but shake with boiling rage. The peace that she and Odin had fought for the North over the past years had now turned to dust. Under the rapacity of the gods, everything she had done seemed like a joke; all her struggles were futile.

        Odin lost his life to the demons; the North Alliance was fatigued. Now with that threatening Dragon of Poison gone, it was surely the best time for the gods to conquer the realm of humans.

        It totally made sense to the gods, but not to her.

        After knocking down an attacking god, Urd walked to the front of the bodies of Odin and the Dragon of Poison.

        “Since I have chosen not to be a bystander, I shall be one of the humanity in my own way—”

        Holding the sword backhanded, Urd thrust it into her abdomen with strong conviction. Blood gushed out as the sword pierced through her body, forming a bewitching pattern like the most beautiful blooming red flower.

        “—even if that only brings temporary peace to this land.”

        Amid the howling wind in the North, Urd fell on the corpses of Odin and the Dragon of Poison. Her blood spread across the frozen land along with the magic circle.

        ‘Stop her now!’ Hovering in the sky, the god who noticed her unusual behavior shouted in exasperation.

        However, it was too late. With her own blood and the bodies of Odin and the Dragon of Poison as the offerings, Urd created a magic circle that could disconnect the whole realm of humans from the gods, blocking the tunnel between the two lands.

        Just then, an illusory gate appeared in the sky and drew all the gods around into it. Unfortunately, Urd was not able to see that since her body had gradually dissipated with Odin’s…

        “Tragedy never ceases to repeat itself. No matter whether I’m watching or participating, I’m still nothing but a ripple in the great river of time.”</p>
