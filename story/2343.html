        <h1>Lan Fan </h1>
        <p>
        A girl born to a family that has served the Yao family for generations, who swears absolute loyalty to Ling Yao and serves as his bodyguard. 

Usually hides her face behind a mask and looks after Ling Yao from the shadows.

Badmouthing Ling Yao is taboo in front of her. In battle, she usually uses hidden weapons such as kunai blades and depth charges. She corners her enemy using martial arts peculiar to Xing. 

Like Ling Yao, she can read people's "chi" as well.
