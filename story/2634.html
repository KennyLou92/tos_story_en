        <h1>Ruler of Scorching Flames - Pompeii</h1>
        <p>
                “Come. No matter if it's good or bad, I’ll seal everything into the depth of the world.”

        Since the seal of the Mechanical City, Pompeii fell into a deep slumber with Monesis in the depth of underground. A long time passed. His consciousness sank in the dream, blending with the power of creation of Monesis and occasionally recalling his good old memories...

        Laughter of different races came one after another; everyone was immersed in Zana’s singing. Awakened by the music, the very first thing that caught Pompeii’s eyes was iridescence of vessels, with brilliant colors all over the earth. The feeling was like he had just had a nightmare but completely forgotten. Pompeii immediately got up and walked towards his fellows. Bahamut and Behemoth were waving, waiting for him to come to the center of the celebration.

        “Did my longing dream finally come true?”

        Suddenly, a crack appeared in the air between Pompeii and his fellows. Crack! It prolonged, followed by the sound of shattering glass. A dark breach was opened in the air.

        “Destroy...Follow your instinct…” The ominous purple aura overflowed from the breach, coiling around Pompeii. The terrifying voice reached deep into his consciousness. He knew that it was not Monesis, but the call of another sinister power!

        The surrounding scenery changed in response to the noise——Shamash the eldus attacked Pompeii's fellows with a magic blast. The sound of explosions and screams overwhelmed the music. Pompeii saw himself using a flame wall to protect the people, but Shamash went away...The injuries of his fellows once again appeared in front of him, and Pompeii could not help blaming himself.

        “Back then I chose giving in and redemption…”

        “It’s because you don’t understand...Plunder and destruction are the instincts of all beings…” A strange voice sounded again.

        “No, not like that! As long as we don’t give up the connection, we’ll understand each other one day!”

        A strong hatred surged from his heart, wrestling with his will of protection. Mush as Pompeii was unwilling to succumb to that power, the more he struggled, the more cracks appeared in front of him...In order to resist that trembling voice, he spontaneously casted the fire around. However, everything was unaffected. He could not intervene...nor could he drive away that voice.

        Phi’s beauty was distorted into an expression of consternation. Her kinetic core was pierced through by a purple blade. With an ear-piercing sound, the attack approached ferociously; a silhouette stood before him to take the strike, who was burnt to a crisp. White smoke rose from the scorched body with the scent of burnt metal, but that face was trampled in front of him…

        “Because you’re too kind...Your kind-heartedness will get everybody killed…” Schnauzer’s last words were like a curse haunting his mind.

        An uncontrollable rage shattered Pompeii’s kinetic core, tearing his body apart like razor-sharp claws. Sadness, self-blame and powerless emotions seemed to stab him like a knife. The sense of dominance began to erode him, constantly demanding and corrupting his will…

        “So it’s my fault isn’t it...I did this…” Pompeii stopped struggling with his eyes closed.

        The crackling sound spread to all directions...Finally, all the scenes shattered and collapsed, making a huge noise. Memories were scattered like glasses, turning into silver dust, eventually nothingness...

        Everything came to dead silence. In the boundless darkness, a pair of crimson eyes filled with desire for destruction opened...
