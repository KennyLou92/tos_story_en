        <h1>Scourge of Purge - Circe</h1>
        <p>
                Since Circe had obtained the texts of magic from the foreign Ithaca tribe, she had immersed herself completely in them all day long until she tired herself out and fell asleep on the desk. In her dream, the elements showed her an illusion of another choice she could have made…

        Circe was completely heartbroken after learning that her daughter killed her own brother, and she put all the blame on the king. Sitting on the throne, Circe looked at the scowling king and felt an inciting hatred flare up inside her, yet she paused at the silver glint on her hand.

        As Circe lowered her head and saw the shining ring on her left hand, she recalled the vow she and the king had made on the day of their wedding as well as the sweet days after that and the peaceful moments of them taking care of their children together… Every bit and piece of the past melted the sudden fit of rage inside her.

        “Even though he has made mistakes, he is still my husband whom I have spent years with. I can’t do this… Forget it. The most important thing now is to find our daughter.” So Circe gave up the idea of poisoning the king and chose to run away to find Medea, her daughter alone instead.

        However, never would have Circe known that the king had no thought of sparing her despite her mercy on him. The king was enraged when he knew that Circe had run away, thus he sent troops to search for her and soon found her.

        The king set off with his soldiers in pursuit of Circe as soon as he learned Circe’s whereabouts, and he finally intercepted her in a forest.

        ‘Go back with me now, and I can pretend that nothing happened,’ the king commanded egotistically, with his chin raised in a proud gesture.

        Circe looked at her husband who had not shown a sign of remorse; her heart was as calm as a stagnant pond. Then she said indifferently, ‘There is no way back between you and me. It is best for us to part.’

        ‘Circe! So even you are going to betray me! Fine… Great! If that’s so, then don’t blame me for this!’ With his eyes filled with resentment, the king waved his hand and gave an order, ‘Knights! Queen Circe has turned her back on our kingdom! And now it is my decree that she shall be executed immediately!’

        At the king’s order, all the knights unsheathed their swords. The cold glint of their blades froze Circe’s heart.

        While the knights charged at Circe, the latter opened her arms with her mouth chanting. A flash of green light emerged and the earth shook. Then countless tree roots sprouted from every corner of the forest and attacked the knights like snakes, hanging hundreds of them in the air in a second.

        When Circe was about to turn around and leave, the king hurled the long sword in his hand with all his strength, which ripped through the air, aiming at her throat——

        Just then, a spear suddenly darted at the sword. Sparks flew, and the sword thrust into the ground.

        Malphas the demonic spirit slowly descended from the sky and stood beside Circe, warning her, ‘You must never let your guard down, my Lord.’

        ‘Malphas, what are you doing here?’ Circe was surprised. In the past, she set Malphas free despite the backlash of the pact so that he could escape from the king’s torture. She never thought that he would come back.

        ‘You’re still my master even without the pact. As your demonic spirit, of course, I have the responsibility to protect you when I know you’re being hunted by that idiot king.’

        ‘Thank you.’ Circe gratefully thanked Malphas with a nod. When she looked back at the king, the latter’s face had already twisted into a frigid grimace. She then slowly walked to the king and looked down at him. The love, kindness and forbearance she once had were now completely gone.

        ‘Your Majesty, I was going to spare your life, considering all those years of our marriage, yet you just keep getting on my nerves, so foolishly…’ Pulling the sword out of the ground, Circe controlled the tree roots to tie the king up and hang him high in the air like crucifixion. The king struggled to break away from the tree roots but their grip only got tighter.

        ‘I-I was wrong… Please—— Argh!’ The king did not get the chance to finish his sentence—Circe stabbed at his throat with the sword. Her eyes narrowed, exuding a compelling aura.

        ‘It’s too late for repentance, your Majesty,’ Circe whispered softly. Just like that, the king breathed his last with his eyes widened and bitter resentment.

        “He doesn’t deserve to be the king. If that be so, I shall take his place.”

        And so, Circe returned to the palace with Malphas. She used his power to clear all the opposing voices in the kingdom and became the queen of Sarmatia. Then, she even took control of the 72 demonic spirits one after another with overpowering magic and stratagem, and eventually became the master of all demonic spirits…

        “Humans never change, and thus I shall never show leniency for my personal feelings.’</p>
