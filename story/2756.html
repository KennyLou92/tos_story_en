        Origin of Demons - Supreme Reckoning Story Ch. 5

        For Mastema’s discontent with Belial, she conspired to revolt against him yet failed as Belial saw through her attempt and captured her soul. However, her soul was soon taken by the traitorous Abadon and Beelzebub.

        Even though Azazel chased after them immediately, he lost them so he could only beg for Belial’s forgiveness. Instead of blaming him, the latter said with a sarcastic laugh, “Mastema’s body has been destroyed. It is useless even if they have taken back her soul so don’t bother to trace them.”

        “...Yes.’ Azazel could only respond respectfully. Yet, there was an inexplicable bad feeling lingering in his heart, which soon came true.

        In an afternoon when the sky was obscured by a dense gray cloud, Azazel was about to leave the barracks and head to Belial’s house with some documents. He stepped out of the camp, however, five demon soldiers stopped him.

        Azazel asked with a frown, “What happened?”

        “Please come with us, sir,” said one of the soldiers.

        “I’m busy. I have to report the investigation results to Master Belial.” Azazel adamantly refused. When he planned to go around the soldiers, a soldier grabbed him by his shoulder and pulled him back.

        “I’m sorry but we’re not asking you, sir.” As the soldier made eye contact with his comrades, the other soldiers immediately stepped forward, attempting to subdue Azazel with force. However, before their hands even touched him, a burst of strong power flicked them off.

        At the same time as Azazel unleashed his power, he flung off the hand that had been holding him. The moment he regained his freedom, he went ahead with his attack before the soldier could even realize it, knocking the four soldiers unconscious in the blink of an eye.

        “Who sent you?” Azazel callously asked the only soldier who was still awake.

        The soldier struggled to utter a few words, ‘It’s… Mas… Master Mastema.”

        “What?!” exclaimed Azazel. The anxiety that crept in on him since Mastema’s soul had been stolen now grew rapidly and eventually turned into a sharp thorn in his heart.

        Azazel no longer dealt with the soldier. After battering the soldier unconscious with a hand chop, he immediately rushed to the mansion of Belial. When he saw that mansion sunk in damp gloom, he dashed inside, putting his own safety behind him. The moment he pushed open the door, he saw Baal, Belial’s older brother, grabbing Belial’s hair and forcing him to lift his head.

        “Master Belial!” Azazel felt his heart stopped beating at that moment. Luckily, his body moved instinctively and unshackled a burst of water elements which then turned into a water dragon and attacked Baal. Dismally, his attack didn’t waver his enemy, not even a bit.

        Lifting his arm, Baal wiped Azazel’s dragon off with just a wave. The unusual noise awakened Belial, who propped his blood-soaked body up and looked at Azazel.

        “Go… Azazel… Go” said Belial weakly.

        “No! I’m not leaving!” Azazel shouted though he knew clearly in his heart.

        ‘With my current power, I can’t protect Master Belial… I need a stronger power…’ Gritting his teeth, Azazel took out a sphere containing dark power, which he took from the dragonkin. He had no idea what it was, only that he knew the sphere was the only bargaining chip he had.

        As Azazel shattered that sphere, he took all that gloomy and despairing darkness into his body. Then, an agonizing pain of being destroyed shot through every part of his body.

        “AHHHH——” The second Azazel let out a hysterical scream of pain, countless tentacles broke out from his body and attacked Baal in an earth-shattering manner. Baal, who could not brush off the attack as easily as the last time, could only let go of Belial and took a step back.

        Seizing this chance, Azazel controlled the tentacles and snatched Belial. Then, he ran out of the door, leaving a bunch of demons that were stunned by his power. Just then, Mastema walked forward and came to the side of Baal.

        “Lord, should I send people to pursue them?”

        “No need.” Baal wasn’t provoked by the fact that Belial had been rescued; instead, he gave an intrigued smile and whispered softly, “That power is the same as his… No, they’re different. It is much more stable than his… How interesting it is. I knew this world would be more compelling than what I had imagined.”

        Since his escape from the mansion, Azazel desperately fled in one direction, running tremendously as if he would be caught once he paused for a second. However, his body soon reached its limits. As the heart-racking pain suddenly befell him, his movements stopped, and fell hard to the ground together with Belial.

        “Azazel!” Pressing the wound on his chest, Belial walked towards where Azazel fell. For the injuries on his leg, his stumbling steps made him look ignominious. Still, he made his way to Azazel, who had scars all over his body. Dark blood was oozing from his wounds, which seemed to indicate the fact that the power of darkness was gnawing Azazel’s body.

        “Mas… Master Belial… Are you alright?” Despite the excruciating pain, Belial was still the first and most important thing that came to Azazel’s mind.

        “Humph, these are just scratches.”

        “That’s a relief… Cough!” Coughing up blood, Azazel could feel that his mind was reeling so he spoke with the last bit of his strength, “Master Belial, I’m afraid Baal will send pursuers after you. Please just leave me here… and go as soon as possible… Hm!”

        “Azazel!” yelled Belial, yet no one answered him. He smacked his tongue displeased, looking into the boundless wilderness. At last, he carried Azazel’s body with the latter’s hand over his shoulder and walked toward the unknown...</p>
