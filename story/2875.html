        <h1>Wicked Scars - Baldwin</h1>
        <p>
                Dark clouds loomed over the sky, casting an ominous shadow over a tranquil village.

        The clang of armor reverberated through the tense air, heavy and foreboding. Baldwin, the Paladin King of Darkness, consumed by the malevolence of his cursed blade, swung his sword toward the young villagers who dared to resist him. His strikes were swift and ruthless, precisely beheading each opponent until no one dared to defy him.

        Baldwin was once an innocent boy who lived in a village, where women constantly gave birth to deformed children. As the only able-bodied boy in the village, he shouldered the responsibility of caring for the elderly, catching the attention of a demon who carried a cursed blade. The demon murdered his parents, forcing the boy to take up the evil sword and become the inheritor of its malice.

        The will of many generations of paladins housed in the evil sword slowly distorted Baldwin’s mind, rendering him cold and merciless. He became deranged—even more than the demons he had fought against—as he sought the pinnacle of swordsmanship. However, the flow of time was unsparingly cruel, and thus Baldwin began to search for a successor—a strong and vengeful boy. Bloodshed befell numerous villages as he pursued his quest, and tonight another village, unfortunately, became his target.

        As always, Baldwin slaughtered all the robust men in the village, leaving only survivors lined up in a row. After plunging his cursed sword into the ground in the front of the line, he proceeded to behead each person taller than the blade, forcing the children who stood behind to witness their loved ones’ decapitated heads rolling down the square. Their cries of terror and sorrow filled the air. For a moment, the village seemed to have become a living hell.

        It was not until Baldwin beheaded a woman that a young boy ran to her lifeless body and burst into tears disregarding the the approaching blade of the evil sword. The sight of the fragile boy triggered a sense of familiarity within Baldwin, causing him to slow his sword’s momentum.

        ‘He…he’s me in the past… Back then, that demon slaughtered my parents and forced me to choose between death or becoming a puppet of the darkness… But I always wanted to be a great hero, someone who saves others... Why have I now become a merciless devil, reveling in bloodbath... Why...’ Baldwin thought.

        Suddenly, his thoughts cleared from the grip of the cursed blade’s influence. Memories of his childhood dream flooded his mind, accompanied by a dreadful sense of guilt and shame. The weight of guilt was so heavy that his grip on the sword slightly loosened. He stumbled and ran away from the village, straight into a nearby forest, where he leaned against a towering tree and slumped to the ground.

        Under the tree, Baldwin looked up at the sky where the dark clouds had lifted, revealing a full moon hanging over his head. As the gentle moonlight beckoned, he removed the helmet that had concealed his face for a long time. His weathered features, now clearly visible, no longer held the youthful vigor, and his eyes were no longer filled with a thirst for bloodshed but rather with confusion and remorse under the moonlight.

        “Senseless slaughter and the pursuit of ultimate swordsmanship were never what I desired,” he whispered, “My life was bound by the elders’ attachment to the village when I was young, and later, I became ensnared by the will of the evil sword… I don’t want this; I want to live my own life!”

        And so, Baldwin discarded his armor and buried the cursed sword in the forest. Then, he sought a prosperous town and found an ordinary job, living a peaceful life. There, he even met a woman who stirred his heart, someone he would like to start a family with.

        However, the ghosts of Baldwin’s past eventually got back to him. His massacre of the villages had stirred the wrath of both humans and gods, leading to a wanted notice being issued. As fate would have it, Baldwin’s lover happened upon the notice and noticed the resemblance to his features. Driven by the lure of the reward, she secretly reported him, conducting a covert operation with Baldwin’s enemies surrounding his home.

        Refusing to accept his demise, Baldwin fought back with all his might and managed to break free from the encircling pursuers. Still, outnumbered, he found himself trapped in a dead-end alley. Yet, something in the alley left him stunned—the evil sword he had buried in the forest was now impaled at the end of the alley alongside his discarded armor. It was as if fate had made it clear that he would never find solace in a peaceful life and he was destined to set foot in the vicious cycle again.

        “Heh... hahaha!” Baldwin let out a sorrowful laughter, resembling a cry. “So, I never truly escaped after all. Right, my hands are already stained with blood. What an idiot I am to expect that I could absolve myself of guilt and sins…”

        The sound of approaching footsteps grew louder, and soon a dozen figures appeared at the entrance of the alley, blocking Baldwin’s only escape route. Among them was a figure who had once evoked Baldwin’s tenderness, but now, only seething resentment remained, followed by an eruption of his long-suppressed murderous intent.

        In truth, Baldwin was aware, despite his desire to deny it, that an indescribable thrill surged within his heart every time he thrust the cursed blade into living flesh. It was the fleeting moment of unparalleled satisfaction—as if he held absolute control over the lives of others—that mesmerized him.

        For the past few days, he thought that a simple and contented life would fill the void within him. Yet, he was wrong—tranquility had never brought him happiness. Coming to the realization, without hesitation, he pulled out the cursed sword from the ground and drove its blade into the body of the woman who had once tugged at his heartstrings.

        With blood spattered across his face, he cracked a deranged grin, sending shivers down the spines of the humans and gods present. The momentary terror rendered them defenseless against Baldwin’s onslaught. They all fell victim to his blade, their lives extinguished, painting the ground with vibrant splashes of crimson.

        After catching his breath, Baldwin redonned his armor, hoisted the evil sword on his back, and left the town he once believed could be his resting place. He continued his journey of slaughter, even more frenzied and ruthless than before, leaving behind countless terrifying legends in the realm...

        “Now that I can never reclaim a pristine life, I shall sink into the depths of darkness, immersing myself in hatred and slaughter until they fester!”</p>
