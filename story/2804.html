        <h1>Crusader of Justice - Perseus</h1>
        <p>
                After seeing the unpardonable tyranny and depravity of gods, Perseus chose to turn his back on his kind and embark on a journey of escape in the Tarones until he met Giemsa, who saw his dedication to justice and gave him the astralist power, guiding him to help the Zodiacs.

        However, Zeus, who noticed Giemsa’s plan, came in the way. Luckily, Perseus and Giemsa were able to move on thanks to the help of Orlos, one of the Mach-Forces.

        On the way, yet, they met a troop of god soldiers in a ruin. What shocked Perseus even more was that the love of his life and his friend—Andromeda and Hercules—were the ones leading the troop.

        ‘Perseus! You…are alive! Thank god… Boohoo.’ While Andromeda was weeping tears of joy, Perseus was having extremely mixed feelings.

        “They must be here to arrest Giemsa. I must not hand her over to them, but I don’t want to fight against them either… What should I do?”

        Without knowing how ambivalent Perseus was feeling, Andromeda wanted to run into his arms but Hercules stopped her by grabbing her by the wrist.

        ‘Herc, why are you stopping me?’ As much as Andromeda wanted to free herself from Hercules’ grip, the latter held her hand even tighter. She then asked him in bewilderment, ‘What is it with that sullen look on your face? Aren’t you happy to see Perseus alive?’

        ‘Didn’t you see?’ Hercules stared at the person behind Perseus.

        “..He saw. I knew I couldn’t keep her long from Hercules.” As Perseus knew that his attempt to hide Giemsa was of no avail, he stopped doing so.

        ‘That is Giemsa…’ A ripple of disquiet spread across Andromeda’s heart. Yet, she still tried to make excuses for Perseus and talked to him with a smile, ‘Perseus, you must have captured her since you knew her disloyalty. That’s excellent. Master Apollo has sent us to capture her, so hand her over. I’m sure that Master Apollo will reward you justly.’

        Instead of answering Andromeda, Perseus looked at the circle of god soldiers around him more vigilantly, as if he was looking for an escape route. 

        ‘Perseus! Please!’ Without getting any response from him, Andromeda began to beg anxiously.

        Seeing Andromeda in agony, Perseus could feel a lump in his throat. Still, he swallowed all the bitterness and anguish, and said with a deeper voice than usual, ‘...I’m sorry.’ 

        The bright eyes of Andromeda dimmed and tears began to well up. On the contrary, Hercules, who was standing aside, was not much surprised. Looking at Perseus, he calmly said, ‘Then don’t blame me for this.’

        Hercules kicked his foot and raised his fist to punch Perseus. Even though Perseus vigilantly lifted his arms to block the attack, he was still knocked a few steps back. Seizing the moment to press home his advantage, Hercules lifted his legs to give Perseus a hefty kick.

        Just when Hercules’ kick was about to land on Perseus, the latter did a backflip and dodged it, which led him away from Giemsa. Sensing Hercules’ purpose, Perseus tried to run back to her immediately but Hercules blocked his way.

        ‘Do you really think you still have the time to care about someone else?!’ With a roar, Hercules summoned his astralist power that draped over his fists and turned into a pair of glowing gauntlets. Then he threw a spate of powerful jabs at Perseus.

        Bang! Hercules’s punches landed on Perseus’ crossed arms before his head with such brute force that even paralyzed his arms for a moment.

        “His power has grown much stronger than before. My arms would have been fractured if I didn’t guard with my astralist power. But I won’t stay beaten!” Perseus suddenly lowered his body and swept his leg at Hercules. However, his opponent seemed to have expected his attack—Hercules forcibly took the attack while keeping his footwork as steady as a mountain.

v‘You can’t beat me in strength! Ha!’ With a twist of his waist, Hercules swung a right punch at Perseus and hit his shoulder. Unable to dodge the attack, Perseus was knocked flying and fell to the ground after leaving a trajectory in the air.

        As Perseus struggled to stand up, a metallic taste suddenly welled up in his throat and turned into a cough of blood. However, instead of smiling with victory, Hercules’ face darkened even though his punch landed successfully.

        ‘Why didn’t you draw your sword?’ Hercules questioned Perseus, squinting his eyes.

        ‘...It’s none of your business.’ Perseus refused to answer the question, yet his averted gaze confirmed Hercules’ suspicion.

‘Are you going easy on me?’ Hercules sneered, ‘Stop it. You have become our enemy since the moment you refused to turn Giemsa in, and you should never show mercy to your enemy. Or is it that you don’t think I’m qualified to be your enemy?’

        ‘No, it’s not that…’ Perseus closed his eyes and thought to himself, “Yeah, he’s right. Since I have made my choice, I should no longer hesitate as it would be nothing but an insult to me and Giemsa as well as to Hercules and Andromeda.”

        When Perseus opened his eyes, the perplexity and uneasiness inside them were gone and replaced by conviction. As he unsheathed the long sword on his waist and summoned his astralist power, scorching flames spread on his blade with thriving vitality.

        ‘Come.’ As soon as Perseus looked at Hercules, the latter immediately knew that he was going to end the fight with this final blow. So Hercules returned him a smile while conjuring his astralist power that made the gauntlets on his fists shine even brighter.

        The next second, the two flexed their legs and charged at each other at the same time——Boom! The clash of powers brought a wave of booming sound and stirred up a cloud of sand and dust.

        Everything became blurry for a while; only two standing figures could be vaguely seen. A moment later, the slightly burlier one fell forward while the thinner one dropped to his knee.

        ‘...I lost… Go… My brother…’ Hercules passed out soon after he finished speaking. Perseus was overwhelmed by mixed emotions, but a male voice suddenly pierced through his head before he could sort out his feelings.

        “Protect her!” Filled with anxiety and impatience, the voice shouted, “Protect Giemsa!”

        Enduring the pain, Perseus abruptly stood up and looked in Giemsa’s direction, only to find that the latter was kneeling on the ground with blood seeping from the corner of her mouth, while Andromeda walked to her and raised the water blade in her hands——

        “No! NO!” Like a shooting arrow, Perseus dashed toward Giemsa while brandishing his sword horizontally.

        The sword knocked the water blade away, which cut Andromeda’s wrist as it flew past her. Blood gushed out with a dreadfully vivid red that pierced into Perseus’ eyes and gave him a terrible squeeze in the heart.

        ‘You used to take care of me in every possible way. You couldn’t even bear to see a wound on me, but why…’ Andromeda sobbed with agony and tears falling from her eyes, ‘How could you hurt me so ruthlessly now… My heart is aching… and I feel so hurt… Why… Tell me why!’

        “Yeah, we can never go back to the old days. No matter how my heart aches, she will always be my enemy.” Perseus could feel a throbbing ache in his chest, but instead of groaning in pain, he took a deep breath and said in a low voice, ‘...Because this is the justice I have to uphold.’

        After gazing at Andromeda deeply for a moment, Perseus then helped Giemsa up and walked in another direction. However, the moment he turned around, he failed to hold back the grief in his heart which turned into scorching tears that rolled out of the corners of his red-brimmed eyes. But even so, it still did not stop his steps forward…

        “I will still keep my faith even if that means I have to go against the one I love.”</p>
