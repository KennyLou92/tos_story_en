        <h1>Puzzle Renovator - Morse</h1>
        <p>        In front of a national college in Tarones, a group of children gathered around a man who was in his fifties. The man, despite time having left its marks on his face, possessed handsome features with a sophisticated charm. Clad in dignified scholarly attire, his eyes shimmered with profound wisdom.

        The man’s name was Morse. He was a sage whose name had spread across the nation, known for unraveling various enigmatic puzzles for the king. His wise insight had strengthened the country and shielded it from the ravages of war.  Yet, he requested to serve as a teacher at the national college after being inspired by some children’s innovative mindset, and this day marked his official retirement from his teaching career of almost twenty years.

        Morse’s engaging and lively teaching style had won over his students who, of course, were reluctant to bid him farewell knowing his retirement. A girl even burst into tears, tugging at Morse’s sleeve as she pleaded, “Mr. Morse… Are you really leaving… I don’t want you to go… Can you stay? Please…”

        “Don’t make things hard for Mr. Morse,” a woman interjected, gently guiding the weeping girl away. At the same time, a man approached Morse and gave him a beautiful bouquet. Both of them were Morse’s former students who had returned to the college and become educators, holding great reverence for Morse.

        “Thank you.” Despite all these years, Morse remained emotionally distant, perhaps because he had devoted most of his passion to solving puzzles.

        “What is your next plan, Mr. Morse?” the woman returned and asked curiously after soothing the children.

        “I haven’t made any. I guess I’ll just see if there are any interesting puzzles out there,” Morse replied absentmindedly. He still had not quite grasped the reality of his retirement which somehow seemed unreal.

        “You haven’t changed a bit, Mr. Morse, still so passionate about solving puzzles,” the woman chuckled.

        “Just the thought of not hearing Mr. Morse’s riddles makes me sad,” the man chimed in, “Your riddles were so interesting that all my drowsiness disappeared when it was your class.”

        After bidding farewell to the other staff at the college, Morse left with a few bags of gifts in his arms. However, instead of heading home, he made his way to a coffee shop at the end of a small alley, following the same old routine he had after work.

        It was a cozy and modest coffee shop with only five tables. Four of them were already occupied, leaving the one by the window vacant.

        “Mr. Morse, you’re here. I’ve saved the window seat for you,” the coffee shop owner, an old lady, greeted Morse as she heard the bell chime. She welcomed him enthusiastically with a warm smile in her eyes.

        “Thank you,” Morse nodded politely in gratitude and took his seat by the window. The old lady walked to his table, a gentle smile spreading across her wrinkled face.

        “The usual, right? A cup of hot coffee, no milk, double sugar,” she inquired.

        “That’s correct,” Morse confirmed with a nod. Then, he caught a glimpse of a new notice on the wall which rarely surprised him, and he asked, “You’re closing the coffee shop next month?”

        “Yes, I am. I’m getting old and I don’t have that much of stamina. My children want me to retire and rest,” the old lady sighed, touching her cheek in reflection, “Time is truly unforgiving. Many things fade away with time and eventually disappear from everyone’s memory.”

        ‘...So, does it mean that all the puzzles I’ve seen and solved will be forgotten and abandoned just like the coffee here?’ Morse closed his eyes and entered the palace of thoughts—a realm he had created in his mind in his childhood to escape the hurtful words and people around him.

        At the center of the palace, a compass with elongated limbs sat atop a stone pillar, looking down at Morse, who had aged. Yet, the compass did not seem to have changed.

        “Yes, I too will be forgotten like all those past puzzles one day. That’s just the way of things, Morse. You realized it just now?” the compass shrugged with a small sigh.

        “Perhaps everything does eventually fade with the passing of time, but I still want to do my best to preserve these memories so that they can last a little longer,” Morse smiled. The experience of spending nearly two decades with innocent children had softened his rough edges.

        Morse opened his eyes as he withdrew himself from the palace of thoughts. He looked at the old lady with a glint of eager determination in his eyes, “Would you mind if I take over your coffee shop?”

        And so, Morse took over the coffee shop from the old lady. He renovated the place, transforming it into a space filled with puzzles he had once tackled, open for the public to solve. It quickly became a sensation in the country and even spread to other parts of the world...</p>
