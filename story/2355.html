        <h1>Envy</h1>
        <p>A mysterious individual with a tattoo of Uroboros on his right thigh.

His true identity is the homunculus of “envy.”

He has the special ability to instantaneously transform into something he has seen just once.

He maintains a genderless appearance, but it's not certain if this is his true form.

His usual personality is facetious, always making fun of others. But when he snaps, he can be terrifyingly cruel.
