        <h1>Hideyoshi the Whizzing War Fan</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 3

        ‘...I never thought of you as my brother. You were just a dog that entertained me whenever I gave you some money. How humiliating it is to be saved by my own pet!’ said the young master with disgust, whom Hideyoshi used to think of as a close brother.

        ‘If you don’t have the money, then I’ll have no choice but to marry that landlord… Hideyoshi, I’m sorry, but I don’t think I can be the mistress of your shop.’ His former lover, Yukiko, wept at him.

        Both of them resolutely turned and walked away after leaving those words. 
        ‘No… Don’t leave!’ shouted Hideyoshi, who stretched his arms with the vain hope of stopping them, only to find that his body was kept down. He desperately struggled and finally broke free from that invisible shackle. However, by the time he sat bolt upright, the two figures were already gone and he saw a young handsome man instead.

        ‘Hideyoshi, you’re finally awake!’ Nobunaga, the young man, cheered in a low voice, which jogged Hideyoshi’s memory. “Right… I came to this island to acquire more wealth…”

        In order to get his wish, Hideyoshi followed the mysterious man’s instructions and came to the island. On the way, he met Nobunaga, the young man, and Nohime, the young girl. He tried to kill them with a trap, but things turned out to be the other way round—he was saved by Nobunaga. Later, they ran into and were joined by Akechi, who was a friend of Nobunaga. Together the four of them began to find a way out of the island.

        Just when Hideyoshi was contemplating his next move, the group encountered Honda, a delirious burly man, who knocked him and Akechi down with just one blow. Luckily, they managed to flee to a safe cave—their current location—with the help of Nobunaga and Nohime.

        But Hideyoshi soon noticed that someone was missing.

        ‘Where’s Nohime? Where did she go?’ As Hideyoshi looked around, he saw Akechi lying on the other side of the cave. It seemed that he had not recovered from Honda’s attack yet.

        ‘She went to follow that man to see if there is anything useful——Hm!’ Nobunaga suddenly let out a groan of pain.

        ‘What’s wrong?’

        ‘No-nothing, it’s just a small wound I got from the fight with that man just now.’

        It was until then did Hideyoshi notice Nobunaga’s unnaturally pale face. Nobunaga’s right hand was pressing his left upper arm wrapped under the sleeve that was soaked in crimson. Apparently, the wound was not as “small” as he had claimed.

        ‘Ha… I’m okay. It’s great that you’re awake. I’ll go get us some food. Can you watch Akechi for me? Just shout my name if anything happens.’

        ‘How can you go outside when you’re seriously injured like this?’ An inexplicable rage welled up inside Hideyoshi. He abruptly stood up and said before thinking it through, ‘I’ll go get the food!’

        ‘Huh? But——’

        ‘Don’t worry. I don’t wanna die yet, so I won’t go too far.’ Hideyoshi walked out of the cave right away before Nobunaga could say another word. Suffering from the aching wound, Nobunaga soon fell asleep with his back leaning against the wall.

        Meanwhile, Hideyoshi scouted around near the cave just as he had promised. He then headed back after he had found some fruits and wild mushrooms. When he walked near the cave mouth, he unexpectedly saw Akechi standing in front of the unconscious Nobunaga. The sword that was supposed to be on his waist was now in his hands, pointing at Nobunaga obviously not with good intentions.

        However, Nobunaga, who had been vigilant the whole time, was still deeply asleep and failed to sense the danger before him because of his injury. Seeing Akechi raise his sword, countless thoughts ran through Hideyoshi’s head in a fleeting second.

        “It does me no good to save Nobunaga. Even if I save him, all I get is just an intangible friendship. Besides, I may get killed if I fail to stop Akechi; even if I manage to stop him, he may still call himself a victim and make me the scapegoat… All I want is just more money. Why should I get myself into such trouble anyway?” As Hideyoshi lowered his head, the scabbed snake bite on his calf came into his peripheral sight. His body stiffened; his hands suddenly clenched into fists. Then he lifted his head while shouting aloud, ‘AHHHH——!’

        Hearing that shout, Akechi froze, then he was tackled to the ground by the sprinting Hideyoshi. The two of them rolled over the ground because of the impact force. Akechi instinctively clasped the sword in his hand tightly.

        ‘You bastard! Let go of me!’ When Akechi found that the saboteur was Hideyoshi, who once derided him, the boiling rage inside him grew even stronger and erupted, staining his eyes with crimson. He raised his sword and stabbed Hideyoshi in his flank.

        Hideyoshi could not even utter a cry of pain but only let go of his hands with a little grunt while Akechi immediately retracted his sword and stood up. Then he kicked the injured Hideyoshi to the side. Powerless to fight back, Hideyoshi could only lie on the ground vulnerably with his hands covering his bleeding wound on his waist.

        ‘Ouch! It freaking hurts! Why… Why do I have to suffer like this… Why did I make such a stupid choice to save that guy…’ thought Hideyoshi while gasping, his eyes still fixed on Akechi.

        Akechi, who did not give up his plan to kill Nobunaga, walked toward his target and raised the sword again.

        A smile suddenly tugged at the corner of Hideyoshi’s mouth. “Nevermind. Since I’ve decided to save him, I shall stick to it till the end, or else I’ll just die for nothing.”

        The golden paper fan on Hideyoshi’s waist gave out a burst of dazzling light and flew into the air as if it was responding to his thoughts. The next second, it split into pieces like it was dismantled by someone. In the blink of an eye, all the sharp leaves and sticks of the fan swished through the air and plunged into Akechi’s body when he held his sword up high.

        ‘Argh!’ Akechi turned around in disbelief and looked at Hideyoshi with his eyes widened. Strenuously, he uttered his last word with bitter resentment, ‘No… I… I can’t die yet… I should be the… Mmm…’

        Much to Akechi’s dismay, he breathed his last before he could finish his words and fell right on Nobunaga, which belatedly awakened the latter from his deep sleep.

        ‘Ouch! That hurts. Why are you lying prone on me?!’ Nobunaga grimaced with pain as Akechi’s body accidentally pressed on his wound, so he pushed the latter away with his uninjured hand. What he did not expect was that Akechi’s body rolled aside defenselessly at his push. Only then did Nobunaga realize the anomaly. He immediately grabbed Akechi’s shoulder and yelled, ‘Hey! Akechi! Wake up!’

        ‘It’s…no use… He’s already dead…’’ Hideyoshi said shakily. Nobunaga heard and looked over, only to see Hideyoshi, whose lower body was covered in blood. It did not take a second look for Nobunaga to realize that Hideyoshi was dying soon.

        Nobunaga could have never imagined that his world would be turned upside down after he took a nap. He was so dumbfounded that he only found his voice after a while and asked with a lump in his throat, ‘What happened…’

        ‘...What if I’m telling you that he wanted to kill you and I stopped him, and now he is dead and I’m dying too, will you believe me?’ said Hideyoshi with a hint of irony.

        ‘...I believe you.’ Nobunaga walked to Hideyoshi and gazed at him. There were no traces of disapproval or rejection but only sincere gratitude in his eyes. ‘Hideyoshi, thank you for saving my life.’

        Nobunaga’s words of thanks somehow brought tears to Hideyoshi’s eyes and blurred his vision. Even though he was on the verge of death, he was not scared, not as much as he had imagined. It was quite the opposite—he felt relieved as though he had finally reconciled with himself, a part of him that he had been denying all along.

        ‘Yeah, I kept saying money and power are the most important, but I just said that to deny my original self. In fact, all I ever wanted was just a simple word of thanks…’

        ‘...Nobunaga, live on…’ As Hideyoshi closed his eyes with a contented smile, scalding tears trickled down from the corners of his eyes. The moment his tears fell to the ground and seeped into the soil, his hands also dropped to his sides with a thud…</p>
