        <h1>Buzzing Bride - Beelzebub</h1>
        <p>Origin of Demons - Supreme Reckoning Story Ch. 2

        After Beelzebub confessed her feelings to Abadon and received the same answer, they decided to leave Belial and live an ordinary life away from power struggles. However, Belial wasn’t willing to let them go.

        Although they got rid of Belial’s pursuit successfully, they couldn’t escape from Baal’s coercion. 
        Baal poisoned Beelzebub and put her into a raging fever. Seeing Beelzebub on the point of dying, Abadon was pressured to help him take Mastema’s soul back.

        While Beelzebub's mind was in turmoil because of the boiling fever, she sensed that Abadon came to her bed, knelt down, and said softly with her hand in his, “Beelzebub, don’t worry. I will complete Baal’s task and come back to save you with the antidote.”

        “No...Don-don’t go!” As Beelzebub woke up, she propped herself up and looked around. Yet, Abadon was nowhere to be found. She realized Abadon had left when she was in a coma.

        ‘I need to find him… find Brother!’ Under the lead of flies that she summoned, Beelzebub went to the base of demons. All the demons that came in her way were gnawed by the flies with only their bones left. However, as the fever that might well melt her body went up again, Beelzebub could only keep going solely relying on her will to find Brother.

        ‘Mmm… So hot… So painful… Brother... where are you?’ Supporting herself with the wall, Beelzebub stepped forward slowly. Suddenly, she caught a smell of burning flesh that gave a hard squeeze in her heart. A burst of energy channeled through her frail legs out of nowhere. She then ran towards where the smell came from only to find a heartrending scene—

        With their backs towards Beelzebub, Azazel and Samael were facing Abadon, who was standing in front of a cabinet dispiritedly. The part below his left elbow was gone with charred skin at the stump. Beelzebub knew that Abadon had burned his wound with fire to stop his bleeding. However, she was still dumbfounded—perhaps the picture in her eyes was too traumatic for her.

        Besides Beelzebub, there was another person who was stunned by Abadon’s action—Samael, who wavered and asked, “Is it worth it just for her?”

        “...Humph, if it wasn’t for her, you think I would put my life at stake for Belial, who only sees me as his pawn?” Even Abadon’s severe injuries and the cold sweat on his forehead couldn’t stop his scornful words.

        “How dare you disparage Belial’s name! Prepare to die!” Once again, Azazel attacked Abadon with a water ball.

        Beelzebub’s mind instantly became clear as she saw Abadon in danger.

        “Don’t hurt Brother!” While Azazel and Samael were staggered, she ran and stood in front of Abadon, driving the flies to surround the water ball. Unfortunately, the continuous use of power eventually exhausted Beelzebub and her body swayed and fell forward.

        “Beelzebub!” The moment Abadon caught Beelzebub, he felt the raging heat from her body so he asked worriedly, “Why did you come?! You could’ve died!”

        Beelzebub murmured weakly, “I’m not afraid…as long as...I’m with you… Beelzebub…” A happy smile spread over her face because she had found her Brother.

        “Is that so? Then I shall grant you your wish and let you two die together!” Azazel said with a contemptuous laugh. Just as he was about to attack, a figure stepped before Abadon and Beelzebub.

        “Samael! What are you doing? You aren’t gonna betray Belial either, are you?” yelled Azazel loudly.

        “Just get her out of here now.” Samael didn’t answer Azazel but talked to Abadon in a low voice.

        Astonished at Samael’s help, yet, Abadon didn’t miss the chance. Holding Beelzebub in his right arm, he turned and ran to a safe forest. When he was about to contact Baal with the communication device, he heard footsteps from his back.

        Alerted, Abadon turned around only to find an unexpected man. “Baal..”
　
        “You got it.” As Baal got straight to the point, Abadon hesitantly took out the container.

        “Yes, that’s it.” After taking the container, Baal put his hands in front of Beelzebub and channeled his magic power. With deep purple energy flowing out of Beelzebub’s body and dispersed, Abadon felt the body temperature in his arms immediately go down to a normal one.

        “Beelzebub!” yelled Abadon nervously. As if she was awakened, Beelzebub blinked her eyes and looked at Abadon. Then she gave him a sweet smile and said, “Brother…”

        “Great, you’re okay…” Overwhelmed, Abadon choked up but soon he suppressed the excitement in his heart. Even though Baal undid the poison he put on Beelzebub as he promised, that didn’t change the fact that he was the man who started it.

        “Bezeelbub, let’s go.”
        “Wait,” said Baal.
        “...I thought we’re even now.”
        “I can heal your arm.”

        “Really? You can heal—” Beelzebub asked in desperation as soon as she heard Baal, but Abadon stopped her.

        “No, I don’t want to owe you anything. I just want to spend my life with Beelzebub alone.”

        “Is it so? What a shame,” said Baal yet his face showed no wavering at all. “Then I shall wish you all the best.”

        “Let’s go.” With a relieved smile, Abadon took Beelzebub’s hand and said, “To find our own home.”

        “Yes.” With Abadon’s hand in hers, she rubbed their hands against her face like a child, whispering words of happiness, “A home of Brother and me.”</p>
