                “Bro... I have been unable to do anything for you.  Not only am I unable to help forge swords, I even need you to take care of me all the time.  This time I can help you.  How wonderful... I am so happy... Brother, you have to take care of yourself... This Evil-Sealing Sword... is a present for you.”

        Having been reunited with the incarnation of her brother in the form of Jing Tian, Long Kui should be happy.  Yet, having been sealed in sword for the past millennium had condemned her to constant fear.  She feared that her brother would again leave her side and so, she would always follow Jing Tian, unwilling to leave his side.  Slowly, she realized that she no longer innocently viewed Jing Tian as her  brother.  The original love between siblings had undergone a subtle change. </p>
