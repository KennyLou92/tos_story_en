        <h1>Emilia & Pack</h1>
        <p>Emilia is a beautiful half elf who has silver hair and bluish-purple eyes, identical to that of the Witch of Envy, who once almost destroyed the world. She is kind-hearted and caring, but for some reason, she refuses to acknowledge that. Accompanied by a cat-like spirit named Pack, she is one of the Royal Candidates for the throne of the Kingdom of Lugunica.

Pack is a spirit whom Emilia is contracted with. As one of the four powerful Great Spirits, he governs fire. He usually appears in the form of a small cat with gray fur, round eyes, and a pink nose. Claiming himself as Emiliaâ€™s parent, he always keep her in company.</p>
