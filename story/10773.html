        <h1>Astute Diagnosis - Watson</h1>
        <p>
                On a quiet morning, a vigorous knock at the door shattered the tranquility of a residential neighborhood in Wellings, the capital of Rycaza. The loud raps continued relentlessly until the young man in the house awakened from his slumber. 

        With a tousled mop of hair and bleary eyes, the young man stumbled to the door and opened it. Standing on his doorstep was a man in a police uniform, his brows drawing together in a grave frown.

        “Oh, it’s you, Inspector Ron. What brings you here again?” the young man yawned.

        “Watson, I apologize for the early intrusion, but I need Holmes’ help,”  Ron said solemnly.

        “Huh? Another case at this ungodly hour? It’s truly tough to be a police officer. Let me go fetch her,” Watson said sympathetically while giving Ron’s shoulder a heartfelt pat. He then went to Holmes’ room and knocked, but no one answered.

        ‘That’s strange. She seldomly fell into a dead sleep… Is she…’ 

        Having a strange foreboding, Watson opened the door and found the room empty. Strangely, a note was pinned to the wall by a knife. Normally, one would have assumed that it was a scene of burglary. However, Watson, accustomed to Holmes’ peculiar habit, calmly took down the note.

        “Let me see… There is an intriguing mystery in Verdilles. I must go and solve it, Holmes…”  Watson read aloud and sighed, “Alas, why is she always like this? Chasing after mysteries one after another…”

        He then returned to the door and said apologetically, “I’m sorry. She’s sneaked out again. I’m afraid she can’t help you today.”

        “That’s bad news. The homeowner specifically requested Holmes...” Ron cudgeled his brains, trying to find a solution. He suddenly looked at Watson as an idea struck him. Watson, feeling uneasy under his gaze, could not help but ask, “What’s wrong?”

        “Well, since Holmes is unavailable, then you’re up!”

        “What?” Watson was confused, “But I’m a doctor, not a detective.”

        “Nobody will know as long as we say nothing. Time is running short, let’s hurry!” Ron grabbed Watson and pulled him along. Reluctantly, Watson followed him to a grand mansion in an affluent neighborhood.

        The servant quickly led them to the study. However, before they reached the door, they heard a cacophony of exaggerated and theatrical cries and wails devoid of genuine emotion.

        ‘This… seems overly dramatic,’ Watson inwardly remarked as he entered the study with Ron. There they saw three men and two women. The women were half-kneeling on the floor next to a corpulent man who lay motionless as if he had passed away.

        The man lying on the floor was none other than Elon, the owner of the mansion, also a renowned tycoon in the kingdom of Rycaza.

        The other two men stood behind the women, wearing a heavy expression. Still, there was a hint of excitement and uncontainable joy in their eyes.

        “Inspector Ron, finally, you’re here!” The woman with short hair ceased her lamentation upon seeing Ron. She stood up and hurriedly walked toward him, “Please, please help us find out who killed my father.”

        “Huh? So it has been confirmed that it’s a murder case?” Watson asked in surprise.

        “Yeah, the detective is right. We haven’t even examined the body yet, and here you are claiming someone killed our father. Perhaps you’re the one who did it, am I right?” the young man standing aside, Elon’s second child, taunted his sister.

        “Don’t you dare try to pin the murder on me!” the short-haired woman, also Elon’s third child, retorted loudly with a furious glare.

        “Stop it, you guys. Let the inspector and the detective do their jobs,” the middle-aged man, Elon’s younger brother, intervened with a friendly smile to ease the tension.

        “I agree. We just want to know what happened to our father,” the demure young woman with long hair, Elon’s eldest daughter, spoke softly.

        “Humph! You’re a bunch of hypocrites! Who knows what schemes you have— Cough!” The short-haired woman’s voice broke mid-sentence, perhaps because of the wailing and crying earlier. She instinctively grabbed a glass of water on the desk and took a sip, moistening her throat before continuing, “Anyway, I’m sure that one of them killed Father. Mr. Detective, You have to investigate—hmph!”

        Suddenly, the woman’s face paled as an ominous gloom washed over her, and before anyone knew, she spat out a mouthful of blood and collapsed to the ground as if she was drained of strength.

        “Ah!” the long-haired woman exclaimed as the short-haired woman continued to cough up blood, while the middle-aged man and the young man stepped back with a grimace of disgust.

        “Everyone, step back!” Hearing the scream, Watson finally recovered from the shock and rushed forward to help the short-haired woman. However, it was too late; the woman unable to bear the excruciating pain had breathed her last.

        “What on earth is happening? How did she just die all of a sudden?” Ron, stunned by this rapid turn of events, stood speechless for a moment before turning to Watson.

        “It’s poison,” Watson cautiously sniffed the glass of water that the short-haired woman had drunk and detected an unusual scent. “It’s potassium cyanide, a deadly poison invented by the demons. It can erode a person’s internal organs in an instant, and thus, it has been classified as a forbidden substance many years ago.”

        “But why would such a deadly poison be here…” Ron abruptly turned his gaze toward Elon, “Elon was supposed to drink the water, but he died before he could and she drank it by mistake…”

        “Brother, I recall you specifically asked the servant to deliver a glass of water to the study this morning,” the long-haired woman suddenly spoke, a gleam of calculation flickered across her seemingly gentle eyes.

        “I-I don’t know what you’re talking about! I have nothing to do with this!” The young man shouted nervously. However, before the others could ask further questions, a terrified scream sounded outside the study. Everyone exchanged looks in confusion.

        “Let’s go,” Watson broke the silence. They left the study and arrived in the living room only to find the butler sitting in front of Elon’s bedroom, trembling.

        “What happened?” Ron asked.

        “Th-there’s a body on the bed,” the butler answered, his voice involuntarily shaking.

        “WHAT?” Watson exclaimed. He bravely approached the bed and lifted the covers, revealing the grimacing face of a woman’s corpse.

        “She… She’s our maid!” the long-haired woman remarked.

        “But how did she get into Elon’s bed?” the middle-aged man questioned.

        “Humph, she’s been sleeping with that old lech for a while, so what’s so strange about her being in his bed?” The young man regarded the maid with disdain.

        “What was the cause of her death?” Ron inquired.

        “Suffocation,” Watson said after he briefly examined the maid’s body, “Someone smothered her with a pillow while she was asleep.”

        “But why?” Ron asked, but soon a realization dawned on him, “I got it, the killer must have mistaken the maid for Elon and killed her instead.”

        “Now we have a question,” Watson said, “Who killed her?”

        “...Well, I saw Master Elon’s brother enter Master’s room when I woke up this morning,” the butler hesitantly spoke out while shifting his gaze toward the middle-aged man.

        “Well, well, so it was you, Uncle. Who would have thought that a gentleman like yourself could be so unforgiving?” the long-haired woman remarked with a smile, clearly enjoying the dramatic turns of events.

        “I-I did go inside that room, but it doesn’t mean I did anything,” the middle-aged man stammered

        “Oh, really?” Watson looked at the middle-aged man, “Then would you please roll up your sleeves and show us your arms? The maid struggled before her death and should have left some scratch marks on the murderer’s arm. ”

        “Wh-what… No…” the uncle instinctively covered his left hand and averted his gaze.

        “What are you hiding, my dear uncle? Just show us,” the young man, wearing a gloating grin, stepped forward to grab the middle-aged man. However, his movement suddenly froze as numerous ominous black spots appeared on his skin accompanied by a searing pain spreading from his chest which almost robbed him of his breath.

        “Ahh… He-help me!” The young man cried for help, extending his hand toward Watson. Yet, the black mist spreading from his chest swiftly consumed him and turned him into a pile of bones that clattered to the ground before he could reach Watson.

        “Um…” Watson crouched beside the skeletal remains of the young man, his face showing mixed emotions. He did not need a close inspection to know the cause of the young man’s death, “He died because of a curse…”

        “A curse?” Ron asked in confusion.

        “Yes,” Watson answered with a heavy heart. He then removed the necklace from the young man’s neck and showed it to everyone, “He died because of the curse cast on this necklace.”

        “Where did he even get this from?” Ron took the necklace to examine it closely.

        It was until then that the middle-aged man broke the silence by pointing a finger toward his elder niece, “It was her. She gave this necklace to my brother. My nephew must have taken it without permission, thinking it was a valuable piece of jewelry, which unfortunately led to his demise.”

        “Yes, I did give it to him,” the long-haired woman admitted, her tone carrying a hint of derision, “But I have nothing to do with his death; he did it to himself for his greed.”

        “This case is just getting more compli—”

        “Woah! St-stay away from me!”

        Unexpectedly, Ron’s words were interrupted by cries from outside the mansion. Rubbing his aching forehead, he exchanged a look with Watson, who simultaneously let out a sigh, and said, “Let’s check outside.”

        Ron and Watson rushed outside the mansion only to see six fierce hounds circling a tree and snarling at the old man precariously perching on top of a branch that trembled as if on the verge of breaking.

        “He-help me!” The old man shouted for help as soon as he spotted Ron and Watson. However, his shout also deflected the hounds’ attention; they immediately sprinted toward their new prey, Ron and Watson.

        Yet, Ron and Watson, as two seasoned fighters, were not flustered by the hounds’ ferocious attack. Working together, they effortlessly subdued the hounds and rescued the old man.

        “Phew, you saved my life. I can’t thank you both enough,” the old man expressed his gratitude sincerely.

        “Not at all,”  Ron replied with a cheerful smile which turned into a frown as he asked,  “What happened to the dogs?”

        “I’m not sure. They suddenly charged at me when I was tending to the garden, so I climbed the tree to avoid them,”  said the old man, who turned out to be the mansion’s gardener, with a troubled look. “They are usually obedient and gentle, well-trained by Master’s second daughter. I have no clue why they turned aggressive all of a sudden…”

        “That’s because they were hypnotized,” Watson discovered the cause after a brief examination of the unconscious hounds. The truth started a spark of anger in Ron, “Who could be so malicious as to hypnotize innocent dogs?”

        “Perhaps the second daughter is the only one who could be responsible,” Watson pondered for a moment before asking the gardener, “Does Mr. Elon visit the garden regularly?”

        “Yes, Mr. Elon comes here for a walk every day,” the gardener replied, glancing at the sky, “It’s usually around this time.”

        The gardener’s words left Ron speechless.

        “What is wrong with this family? Everyone wants Elon dead!” Watson finally blurted out the question in his head.

        “Sigh, let’s head back and check on Elon—”

        “Ahhhh!”

        Ron’s words were once again drowned out by a scream. Rolling his eyes in exasperation, he turned to Watson and said, “I have no words to say. Let’s just go.”

        “Agree,” Watson nodded. Together they returned to the mansion where they found the middle-aged man lying on the ground with a dagger plunged into his chest. Blood kept gushing out, forming a puddle on the floor. His eyes were wide open, his face forever frozen at the last moment of his life, staring at the woman standing before him—his eldest niece, the long-haired woman, who held a blood-dripping dagger. It was evident that she had killed her uncle.

        The woman turned around upon hearing footsteps, a triumphant smile tugged at the corners of her lips as she said, “Now that everyone is out of the picture, I shall have everything!”

        However, Watson shook his head.

        “No, you’re wrong. There’s still one person alive. You can never claim the inheritance as long as he’s still alive.”

        “WHAT?” The long-haired woman shouted in agitation. “Who is it? Who is not dead?”

        Instead of answering the question, Watson walked over to Elon and placed his ear against his chest, from which he heard a faint heartbeat. He realized that Elon was still alive when he noticed a slight difference in his position when he ran to the garden. Both Ron and he made the wrong assumption because of the reactions of Elon’s family.

        “Your father was never murdered. He fainted due to low blood sugar and passed out after hitting his head against the desk. Ironically, none of you bothered to check on him, hence you didn’t realize he was still alive.”

        “Damn it… DAMN IT! I finally got every one of them out of the picture, and now you’re telling me that old rascal is still alive…” The long-haired woman, deeply in shock, shook her head erratically. She suddenly looked up, her mouth curled into a wide grin as she chuckled, “Very well, I guess I just have to kill him myself!”

        After saying those words, the woman lunged forward, wielding a dagger at Watson.

        “Watch out!” Ron yelled, attempting to stop the woman but he was still one step too late.

        Fortunately, the woman was no match for Watson.

        As an Akashic, Watson had the key to the Bibliotheca of Truth. Although his access was limited to the medical and combat section on the lower levels of the bibliotheca, the knowledge there had elevated him to heights beyond the reach of ordinary individuals.

        In a swift motion, he bent, spun, and swept the dagger from the woman’s hand. He then seized her with both hands, effortlessly pinning her down while remaining unscathed.

        “Your combat skills are still as impressive as ever, ” Ron praised. 

        “It’s nothing,” Watson replied with a smile. 

        Later, Ron called for police support and had Elon taken to the hospital while his eldest daughter was arrested and sent to the police station.

        After the harrowing ordeal, Watson was utterly exhausted, yet he knew it was not the time for him to rest because he still had to find one person.

        ‘I’m begging you, Holmes, don’t stir up trouble before I find you,’ Watson silently prayed to the Bibliotheca of Truth.</p>
