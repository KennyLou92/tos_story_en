        <h1>Crescent of Tainted Flame - Iori Yagami</h1>
        <p>
        Iori Yagami is the heir of the Yasakani clan, one of the three clans that sealed the legendary snake entity, Orochi. His family's treasure is the Yasakani Jewel and his family crest is the crescent moon. Tempted by Orochiâ€™s power, the Yasakani made a blood pact with Orochi. After gaining the forbidden power,  the Yasakani renamed themselves as the Yagami clan. As a side-effect of Orochi's curse, the once crimson flames of the Yagami now have a bluish tint. The curse also causes each heir to die young. Traditionaly, the heirs of the Yagami and the Kusanagi fight for their blood feud. But with Iori, he fought Kyo solely because he despised him.</p>
