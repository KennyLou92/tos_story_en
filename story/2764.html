        <h1>Honda the Ironclad Fist</h1>
        <p>Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 1

        Honda felt a sharp stabbing pain in his head. Before his eyes were the corpses of elves and mad men sprawled across the ground.

        Earlier, Honda found Komatsuhime’s sachet in a pool of blood. His memory of what happened after that was just tumultuous and vague. He only knew that Tokugawa had said something next to him, although the latter was now nowhere to be seen.

        The mere thought of Komatsuhime getting injured stirred up negative emotions inside Honda, just like an unstoppable drop of ink that spread and absorbed over a piece of white paper.

        Tokugawa, who was watching all this in the woods, wore an eerie smile and waited for the fierce fight to break out soon——

        “Those people ahead… They may know where Komatsuhime is.” Trying his best to maintain his consciousness, Honda looked over to where three men and one woman were coming. He immediately recognized the woman’s face—she was the assassin who once tried to kill him.

        Back then, Nohime was sent to assassinate Honda. Luckily, Honda was saved by a retainer, yet at the cost of the latter’s life.

        His steps were stumbling; his head was spinning.

        As Komatsuhime’s face gradually overlapped with the traumatic dying look of the retainer in Honda’s mind, he snapped and his heart filled with a boiling yet murky emotion.

        ‘It’s you… You killed Komatsuhime! It must be you!’

        Honda glared at Nohime in rage. He flexed his muscles, then leaped over to where Nohime and Nobunaga were with his metal arm slamming down at them with a storm.

        Perhaps it was Nohime’s years of fighting on the line between life and death, she immediately pulled Nobunaga over and jumped aside as she had a foreboding.

        With a boom, a deep hole was made on the hillside where the four people had just stood in the blink of an eye. An indistinct figure was moving amid the clouds of flying sand and dust.

        Without a second thought, Akechi drew his sword and slashed it right at Honda in the dust cloud. However, Honda also charged and knocked him flying with a spinning back fist. Akechi passed out as he fell onto the ground.

        The shockwave of Honda’s punch also blew Hideyoshi to a tree not far away and the impact of his body hitting the tree trunk paralyzed him for a while.

        After getting the two people out of his way with one blow, Honda promptly lunged at Nohime. The latter swiftly avoided his attack, knowing that she couldn’t fight against him head-on. Yet, Honda just kept chasing after her relentlessly.

        Nobunaga drew his sword and parried the sudden metal fist for Nohime. The sound of metal hitting echoed around the space. Nobunaga could feel incredibly great power from the fist which even caused the tingling between his fingers and numbness in his hands.

        Seeing the destructive power and insanity of Honda, Nobunaga came to a judgment that it would not be a wise choice to keep fighting Honda so he gestured at Nohime to retreat.

        Nohime immediately followed—she raised her hands and shot steel wires toward the unconscious Akechi and the badly injured Hideyoshi, trying to pull them away. Unfortunately, Honda noticed her movement and rushed over to stop her.

        However, Honda failed to do so because Nobunaga came to intercept him and left a wound on Honda’s arm with his long sword. Just when Nobunaga was about to press home his advantage with another attack, Honda abruptly held out his hand and grabbed Nobunaga’s sword despite the pain of the sharp blade cutting through his skin with blood gushing out from his palm.

        ‘Don’t try to run away! AHHHHH——!’

        Honda roared as he forcefully pulled the blade toward him and swung a punch at Nobunaga. Just when his punch was about to hit Nobunaga right in the face, a steel wire of Nohime wrapped around Nobunaga’s waist and carried him to midair.

        With a thundering boom, a blast of wind created by Honda’s punch swept through the woods, flipping both the soil and trees over. The space was shrouded in clouds of sand again.

        Even though Honda’s punch didn’t directly hit Nobunaga, its shockwave still inflicted some damage on him, causing blood to ooze slowly from the corner of his mouth. Yet, Nobunaga’s eyes were still fixed on the vague figure of Honda in the clouds of sand.

        Grasping his sword backward with one hand, Nobunaga held it up high horizontally, close to his face.

        ‘Nohime!’
　　
        When Nohime saw Nobunaga’s movement, she immediately knew his intention, so she speedily created a net between the trees with her wires to serve as a foothold for Nobunaga while controlling other wires to wrap around his limbs——

        The wires helped Nobunaga spin and strengthened his force like springs. Nobunaga took aim at that madly overpowering figure in the dust cloud, then threw the sword in his hand with all his strength. Ripping through the air like a thunderbolt, the sword cut through Honda’s right shoulder and pinned him on a tree trunk.

        Just then, a teenage girl’s shout sounded.

        ‘Dad!’

        That was a voice that Honda would never forget no matter what, not even when he was swallowed by madness.

        ‘Komatsuhime!’ As Honda’s sanity slightly returned from the state of turmoil, he no longer kept pursuing Nobunaga and his companions. He turned around and climbed up the hill towards where the sound came from while shouting frantically.

        ‘Take Akechi and Hideyoshi! Go!’ At Nobunaga’s shout, Nohime’s wires flew again and lifted the two men. Then she promptly retreated with them after throwing a smoke bomb.

        In a nearby forest, Tokugawa, who had been secretly watching everything, saw Honda walking toward the hill.

        ‘It’s almost there. It’s almost complete. I must not miss this chance!’</p>
