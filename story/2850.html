        <h1>Prolocutor of Earth - Duncan</h1>
        <p>        After myriad battles, Duncan and the power of Earth had fused. The earth elements brought him into an illusionary land…

        Born in times of war, Duncan was raised by a group of druids in a forest. Believing that Duncan was blessed by the earth, the druids had always wanted him to be the priest of the forest but the young druid would rather be a cleric instead.

        One day, the elder of the druids came to persuade Duncan. He said, “Duncan, you have the earth’s blessing. Why don’t you put this gift into use?” 

        “Elder…” A look of puzzlement crossed Duncan’s face. Despite his extraordinary powers, he was still an innocent teenager at that point, so he could not help but ask, “I don’t understand… We protect the sheep but we also slaughter them and feed ourselves with their meat. Isn’t that an act of destroying nature?”

        “You’re a kind child, Duncan.“ With a gracious smile, the elder stroked Duncan’s hair which was as soft as the fur of a newborn lamb. He then continued in a gentle tone, “Death is also a gift from nature. It is a part of the circle of life. Life and death are inseparable. They form a balance that no one should break.”

        “...I still don’t get it,” said Duncan in dejection, unable to figure out what the elder meant.

        “Don’t rush, my boy. Be the priest, and time will tell you the answer.”

        “But I…”

        As reluctant as Duncan was, he finally compromised when he lifted his head and saw the gleam of expectation in the elder’s eyes. He agreed to be the priest of the forest instead of a cleric and began his learning under the elder.

        One day, a young earl came with a troop of soldiers when Duncan was studying some herbs with rapt attention. Since the elder had gone out to collect herbs, the duty fell on Duncan’s shoulders to receive the uninvited guests as the representative of the druids.

        “...You are the leader of the druids?” Although the earl was surprised by Duncan’s young age, he recovered his composure in the blink of an eye. Then he explained his purpose of visit to Duncan sincerely, “The demons’ invasion has become more rampant after the gods’ withdrawal from the human realm, and we would like you the druids to join us, the Human Forces.”

        Unfortunately, the young earl’s speech did not move Duncan but aroused his aversion—the young druid hated war since it had taken his parents. With such prejudice to violence, Duncan answered in a deep voice with his face darkened, “We the druids have no intention of participating in any wars. We only want peace in the forest, so please go back to where you come from, Your Lordship.”

        Duncan’s attitude enraged the soldiers who stepped forward to teach him a lesson only to be stopped by the earl. Remaining calm, the earl looked at Duncan composedly, “We respect your wish, but please allow me to say this: fate won’t spare anyone. You will also be forced to take up weapons one day.”

        The earl left after leaving Duncan a word of warning. Later, the elder came back and learned about what had happened. From the disappointment in the elder’s eyes, Duncan knew that the elder was not happy about his decision to turn down the earl even though the elder had not said a word to blame him.

        At that time, Duncan did not understand why the elder was disappointed at his decision of rejecting violence, but he soon understood because the demons attacked the druids for no logical reason.

        The devious and cruel demons tormented all the druids they captured to death no matter how they begged for mercy.

        As the earl had said, Duncan picked up a spear in desperation trying to kill the demons to protect his clan. However, the elder stopped him by knocking him unconscious. Although the elder managed to elude the demons’ siege while carrying the unconscious Duncan on his shoulder, he was seriously injured.

        By the time Duncan woke up, the elder was already lying in a puddle of blood. Tears overflowed Duncan’s eyes as the overwhelmingly cruel fact struck the young druid. On the verge of death, the elder looked at Duncan graciously just like the way he always did.

        “Duncan… Don’t harbor resentment… Think about where life comes from, where it grows from, and what it grows into… You have to understand what damage killing truly does to us… And then, if you find it is necessary, then it should be a death determined by nature…”

        After giving Duncan his final lesson, the elder closed his eyes and returned to nature and the earth where Duncan buried him. The unsparing reality forced the young druid to grow in one day and he finally understood the law of nature that he had found incomprehensible.

        “Elder, now I know. War is a part of nature. It is a disaster staged by the earth to filter out those who can’t survive. The suffering of life and death makes lives grow, and I won’t run away from violence and death again.”

        After bidding his last goodbye to the elder, Duncan took his spear and joined the young earl’s troop with regrets so as to maintain the circle of life…

        “I’m not powerful and I don’t understand the true meaning of nature. It is my best option to become a shepherd who travels around the world to experience different kinds of emotions.”</p>
