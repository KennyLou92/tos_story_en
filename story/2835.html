        <h1>Irreplaceable Gift - Cilantro & Jabir</h1>
        <p>
                On a vast prairie, a gigantic beast was running. However, it seemed to be running out of stamina as its speed gradually slowed down. Eventually, it fell on the grass with a bang after a few stumbling steps. Then, its colossal body began to shrink while trembling, and finally transformed into a petite girl.

        The girl was named Cilantro. She was once a tool of Copernicus, the headmaster of Lomond Manor, but she later broke free from the oppressive laboratory after Jabir had given her his power.

        However, Cilantro’s human body was not designed to take in such immense power all of a sudden. As the discomfort in her body grew after the escape, she eventually turned back to her human form and slumped onto the ground from fatigue. In a state of clouded consciousness, she heard footsteps that came with two huge shadows lying across her body.

        ‘I did smell an Elemental Beast. How come it turns out to be a human?’ A boy’s voice sounded with puzzlement. Then, a girl’s voice responded, ‘It is strange… Let’s take her with us and ask her when she’s awake.’

        ‘Okay!’ said the boy energetically. He then bent down to hoist the paralyzed Cilantro onto his shoulders. The bumpy movement sent Cilantro, who was already at the end of her strength, into a dead sleep.

        Cilantro’s slumber lasted for two whole days as though it was to make up for the nights that she had not slept. It was a heavy feeling in her chest that woke her up from the prolonged sleep.

        When she opened her eyes, she found that her sight was occupied by a fluffy ball. She immediately sat up straight in astonishment only to find that the fluffy ball was actually a little chubby cub’s bottom.

        ‘Yip!’ The little cub yipped at Cilantro enthusiastically as if it was happy that she was finally awake. The unfamiliar warm reception befuddled the girl. Just when Cilantro was at a loss for reactions, someone walked in and grabbed the cub by its neck, lifting it in mid-air.

        ‘What are you little rascal doing here? Didn’t you learn the lesson?’ A male beast—more precisely a boy—gave the cub a gentle nose flick. The cub thought that the boy was playing with it so it tried to bite his hands which caused the boy to yelp.

        ‘Enough!’ A female beast came in and kicked the boy’s bottom with her leg. The painful kick made the boy let go of the cub which nimbly landed on the ground and ran outside to play with other cubs.

        ‘Tut! You know no beast would like a violent mate like you… Ouch! You hit me again!’

        ‘Humph! That’s because your mouth is full of nonsense.’ The female beast gave the boy a cold glare before she turned her eyes to Cilantro, who had remained quiet all along. Giving the human girl a big grin, she said, ‘You’re finally awake. How are you feeling? Everything’s alright?’

        ‘I’m feeling fine…’ Cilantro shook her head. As strange as it sounded, Cilantro found the two beasts incredibly amiable even though she had never met them before. The strange feeling made her lower her guard and soften her voice to ask, ‘Sorry but who… are you?’

        ‘I’m Nolan, and this is Ivy, my sister. We’re both Elemental Beasts,’ Nolan hurriedly introduced himself before his sister did.

        ‘Elemental Beasts?’ Bewildered, Cilantro could not help but ask the question that popped up in her mind, ‘But I thought all the Elemental Beasts had been massacred… Why are you…’

        ‘Our parents used their own lives to fight a way out so that Nolan and I could take the cubs away. We have been living in this town secretly ever since.’ Putting away her smile, Ivy looked at Cilantro solemnly and asked, ‘What about you? Why would a human like you possess the power of an Elemental Beast?’

        ‘I… Jabir gave me his power…’ And so, Cilantro told Nolan and Ivy everything that had happened between her and Jabir. Nolan, who was candid and undisguised, exploded with rage soon after he heard the story. He could not help but stomp around while cursing loudly.

        ‘Darn it! I know humans are no good!’

        ‘Nolan!’ Ivy yelled at Nolan while glancing briefly at Cilantro. It was then that Nolan realized what he had said. With his ears drooping, he muttered an apology to Cilantro, ‘I’m sorry. I wasn’t talking about you…’

        ‘It’s okay.’ Cilantro did not feel provoked. Instead, she comforted Nolan and said, ‘ I understand.’

        Having a low tolerance for her embarrassing brother, Ivy decided to brush him aside. She then turned and asked Cilantro, ‘Do you have any plans?’

        ‘I… I don’t know.’

        ‘Why don’t you stay with us then? I can tell you haven’t gotten used to Jabir’s power and we can help you with that.’

        ‘Well… I guess we’ll be roommates then.’

        And so, Cilantro stayed with the Elemental Beast siblings who then taught her how to use the Elemental Beasts’ power. Her talents were soon revealed as she mastered the power in a short period of time—she could turn into a beast like Jabir. In one of their lessons, she skillfully dodged Nolan’s attacks in her beast form and went around his back to give a power kick that sent the boy flying.

        ‘Haha, I give up!’ Lying on the ground with his belly exposed, Nolan said while catching his breath, ‘Cilantro, you’re incredible. You’ve grown so much stronger in a short period of time.’

        ‘Humph, that’s because you’re too lazy.’ Ivy then continued after giving her younger brother a warning glance, ‘Since Cilantro has mastered Jabir’s power, it’s time for us to leave.’

        ‘Wait, where are you going?’ Cilantro asked in surprise.

        ‘We’re leaving this human town to an uninhabited place,’ Ivy explained. ‘We only stayed here to save our kind who also survived the massacre. Now that we’ve saved all we can save, it’s time for us to leave.’

        ‘Yeah,’ Nolan sat up straight and continued the conversation with a grin. ‘Humans are really scary. My sister and I may not be able to keep those cubs safe solely by the two of us if those hateful bastards find us, so leaving here is the best solution.’

        ‘Cilantro, come with us.’ Ivy extended a paw to Cilantro, who hesitated.

        “It was Jabir’s dream to live with his people, but is this what I want?”

        ‘I… Please let me think about it.’ Still, Cilantro was unable to make up her mind.

        ‘I know how you feel. This is still your birthplace no matter what happened before. Leaving here rashly is not an easy decision to make. We plan to leave in three days so take your time and sit on it.’ Ivy ended the conversation lightheartedly. She even went out with Nolan to gather food and daily necessities for their journey so as to give Cilantro space to think.

        For the next two days, Cilantro stayed in the cave with countless thoughts racing through her mind. On the third day, she decided to clear her head with some fresh air—she turned into her beast form and galloped around the prairie for a few laps. When she went back to the cave, she heard a shrill cry before she stepped into it.

        “It’s the cubs! They’re in danger!” Cilantro’s face darkened in an instant. She rushed into the cave only to see something that racked her nerves—a chimerical monster that had the body of a giant beast and the head of a human was grabbing an Elemental Beast cub, trying to crush it with its huge claws.

        ‘Stop!’ Cilantro shouted while pouncing on the monster as fast as she could. Her unexpected tackle forced the monster to loosen its grip and the cub fell to the ground.

        ‘ROARRR—!’ With a furious roar, the monster swung its claw at the girl who had interrupted its hunt.

        ‘Argh!’ The monster’s sharp claws ripped through Cilantro’s stomach. Unguarded, she failed to avoid the attack for her eyes were fixed on the cub in its claws. The pain of tearing flesh made her groan. Still, she put up with it and yelled at the other cubs that were cowering in the corner, ‘Run!’

        ‘Yip… Yip!’ The cubs listened to Cilantro and all ran outside the cave. As much as the monster wanted to chase after its escaping prey, a force dragged it back into the cave—it was Cilantro!

        She refused to fall despite the bleeding wound that was about half her arm long on her abdomen but pounced to hold the monster down.

                ‘I… I won’t let you hurt them!’ Just when Cilantro lifted her head to bite the monster’s weak spot, she felt a menacing gaze behind her. Although she immediately moved her body after detecting the strange gaze, it was still too late—two other disfigured monsters that had been lurking on the top of the cave jumped down with two blades in their hands plunging into Cilantro’s hind legs!

        ‘AHHHHH—!’ Cilantro’s scream of pain echoed around the cave. The excruciating pain made it impossible for her to hold down the monster beneath her body. The monster ran away with its eyes on the evading cubs; it would not take long for it to catch its prey. As much as Cilantro wanted to break free from the monsters’ control, the terrible wounds on her body made it impossible. What even worse was that her mind began to fade due to the excessive loss of blood.

        “Am I going to watch the ones I care about getting hurt and die miserably again… I don’t want that…” Cilantro muttered silently with her heart in ache. Just then, a familiar voice sounded with a crimson light glowing on her chest, saying, “Don’t cry… Here, let me help you…”

        ‘Jabir…’ Cilantro whispered the beast’s name in surprise as she recognized the voice. At the same time, a warm but scorching energy welled up from her heart and quickly circulated through her veins, healing all her wounds. The blood left on her skin turned into bewitching blue flames that draped around her body—

        ‘Arghhhhhhh—!’ The two monsters that were holding down Cilantro let out screams of terror as the blue flames engulfed their unsightly bodies and burned them into ashes in an instant.

        “Here, Cilantro. Fight! Fight for your freedom!”

        ‘Jabir… Yeah, I will fight while carrying your dream!’ As soon as Cilantro regained freedom, she resumed her stance and arched her muscled body to aim at the monster that was hunting the cubs. Aggression stained her eyes red. With a mighty howl, she dashed toward the monster like a flying arrow and opened her mouth to bite off its flesh, causing a spurt of blood.

        Even though the monster struggled desperately, it could not get away from Cilantro but only took in her attacks helplessly until it breathed its last.

        It was only until all enemies were defeated that Cilantro loosened her taut nerves. Without the strength to maintain her beast form, she turned back to her human form. While she gasped for air, she caught a glimpse of a bright orange shade on the monster’s body. Out of curiosity, she propped herself up and slowly walked to pull out the orange object, only to find that it was a strand of orange hair tied with a red string.

        It only took a glance for Cilantro to recognize whose hair it was because it had the same color as the hair of the only friend she had back in the days when she was in the laboratory; it was a light orange shade that was as bright as the sun.

        “It’s Doya’s hair… So he sent these monsters… It’s Copernicus… He is sending me a warning.”

        ‘Cilantro!’ From a distance came Nolan’s shout. He and Ivy asked Cilantro nervously soon after they ran to her side, ‘Are you alright? What happened?’

        ‘I’m fine. There were several monsters attacking the cubs just now, but don’t worry. I’ve taken care of them.’ 

        Cilantro then looked at Ivy. The puzzlement in her eyes three days ago was cleared and replaced by resolution, ‘Ivy, I’ve made up my mind. I’m staying here.’

        ‘...So you’re going to end things with those guys,’ said Ivy in a low tone. ‘But the path you’re going to take will be very difficult and it will be full of dangers. Do you still insist on doing so?’

        ‘Yes. I have to take down Copernicus, destroy those labs and save those who have the same fate as me. Only by doing so can I be truly freed.’

        ‘You... You’re all grown up, Cilantro.’

        ‘Yeah. It’s all thanks to Jabir. He taught me what freedom is and who I am.’ Cilantro smiled nostalgically.

        Later, Cilantro bid farewell to Ivy and Nolan as well as the Elemental Beast cubs. She watched as their figures receded into the depths of the woods. It was not until sunset that she finally moved and ran toward the town where machinations and dangers were hidden…</p>
