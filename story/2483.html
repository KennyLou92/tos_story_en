        <h1>Fox of Thousand Faces - Inari</h1>
        <p>Finale of Yamato - Ch.8

        The lives of Izanagi and the others returned to ordinary as all the misunderstandings were cleared, but everyone was not living as the same before.

        After a period of recovery, Susanoo resumed his journey again, saying that he still had a promise to deliver. A bit worried, Amaterasu decided to put her faith in him and let him go.

        Izanagi quitted his Onmyōji career as he had lost his spiritual energy and eyesight. He became a teacher who taught children magic theories. By sharing his experience, he hoped that he could enlighten the children to become a righteous person.

        After the reconciliation, Izanami had been taking care of Izanagi closely. She took his place to pray and exorcise for the people in the town. The two never left each other alone, becoming the model couple in everyone’s eyes.

        Tsukuyomi had stopped dreaming of her dead parents, and her trauma was healing day by day. 

        Later Tsukuyomi worked harder on her magic, hoping to become an Onmyōji even greater than Izanagi in the future. One day when she was capable of living on her own, she’d repent her sins by travelling the world to help the people in need. Ever since her return, the relationship between her and Amaterasu had become even better than the old times. The sisters stuck together all the time, and Inari was not very comfortable with it.

        Ever since that battle, Kagutsuchi had never lost control of his spiritual energy again. He became a renowned taoist working hard on becoming an Onmyōji. Sometimes he would work on a quest on his own. If Amaterasu got a job request, he would come back and accompany her no matter what.

        As for Amaterasu, she spent more time at home than before. One day when Inari asked her why, she said, “I hope everyone remembers that someone’s waiting for their return whenever they’re on a quest or a trip. And someone will greet them with “welcome home” when they return. That’s it.”

        Looking at the delightful and contented look on Amaterasu, Inari responded happily, “then you’ll have my company so that you won’t be bored.”

        “Thank you, Inari,” said Amaterasu, smiling.

        This day, Amaterasu received letters from Susanoo and Kagutsuchi respectively.

        “Wait what!? Since when did Susanoo have a wife? And he’s bringing her home! Kagutsuchi said he had something important to tell me. What’s happening? Nonono, the important part is that they’re coming back. I gotta cook something they like...But it’s too late to shop now! W-What should I do?”

        Amaterasu’s panic was witnessed by Tsukuyomi and Inari.

        “If Amaterasu has no time to do the shopping, then let’s help her!” Tsukuyomi suggested.

        “Hmm...But do you know their appetite?” Inari doubted.

        “Humph, of course. I’m everyone’s favourite!” The confident Tsukuyomi then pulled Inari out of the house.

        Arriving at the market, Tsukuyomi was carried away by the various goods. Inari, observing aside, spoke to bring her stray mind back, “hey, we’re here to do grocery shopping for Amaterasu.”

        “Oh...right. I almost forgot about it. The market is such a dangerous place…”

        “You’re the dangerous one here...How can you forget your purpose that soon…”

        Although Tsukuyomi remembered the favorite dishes of Amaterasu and Susanoo, she became frustrated when she couldn’t recall those of Izanagi, Izanami and Kagutsuchi…

        “The three of them have similar preferences, something spicy. Hmm...what’s that spicy food…” Inari reminded Tsukuyomi by raising a question.

        “Curry!”

        Reminded by Inari, Tsukuyomi recalled their favorite food immediately.

        They were planning to go back as they had bought all the needed ingredients, but then they were attracted by all sorts of intriguing stuff in the market——street performers, snacks, mini games and etc…

        Unable to resist the temptations, the crowd-loving Tsukuyomi and Inari spent the whole afternoon in the market. By the time they got home, the sun was already setting and Amaterasu was waiting for them at the doorstep grumpily.

        “Gosh, where have you two been? Do you know that I’ll be worried when you’re gone for this long!”

        “Sorry Amaterasu...But we’ve bought the food that everybody likes!” 

        When Tsukuyomi opened her shopping bag in a thrill, she realized that everything in the bag was either broken or melted...Tsukuyomi and Inari began to cry as their effort went in vain.

        Their tears had softened Amaterasu, who went over to give them a hug.

        “Thanks for the effort anyway, and welcome back, Tsukuyomi, Inari.”

        “Right! We’re back!” They wiped the tears away and responded to Amaterasu with a smile.

        At this moment, Kagutsuchi came out of the house and asked, “Tsukuyomi, Inari, where have you been? Why the late return?”

        “Kagutsuchi!”

        Their frustration was cleared as Kagutsuchi went over and rubbed their heads.

        “Oh! Susanoo is back too,” said Amaterasu, pointing behind Tsukuyomi and Inari.

        Turning around, Tsukuyomi and Inari saw Susanoo coming over with Kushinada hand-in-hand. All of them went back into the house while Izanagi and Izanami were waiting at the dining table already. Then the family started the dinner prepared by Amaterasu.


        Inari smiled as it saw the joyful smile on everyone’s face. This was the “home” that brought her peace, and the people surrounding her were her “family”...
