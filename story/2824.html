        <h1>Guide of Souls - Osiris</h1>
        <p>        One day, Osiris, who roamed around Tarones, came to a village that had been bloodbathed because of war. Seeing the myriad of lost souls, the kind Osiris felt sorry for them so he led them to the magic circle.

        Under Osiris’s guidance, it took quite a while for all the dead souls to go to where they belonged through the magic circle. Yet, a little girl’s soul stayed behind. Standing in front of Osiris, she looked scrawny and fragile.

        Osiris lifted his left hand and said in a gentle and calm voice, ‘come with me.’

        ‘No! I’m too hungry to walk!’ The girl closed her eyes and pouted, tilting her face away. With her arms and legs crossed, she sat on the ground and threw a tantrum, showing no intention to move on.

        He knelt down to the little girl and asked, ‘Then what should I do… so you’ll come with me?’

        Stealthily, the little girl opened one of her eyes and took a glance at Osiris, who was waiting patiently. Only then did she turn around and say excitedly while clenching her fists, ‘I want to eat a lot, a lot of food!’

        “What a wilful soul… Well, since it’s my decision, I’ll help her to the end,” thought Osiris. He then put out a hand, held her bony little hand, and took her to the bustling town.

        The town was even more buzzing in the night—there were dancers dancing along the main street to the accompaniment of piano and flute; the vendors on the sides were clamoring for attention. With the fragrance of flowers and spices filling the air, the astonishing variety of goods and delicacies on the street made a feast for the eyes.

        As the fat oil of the roasted meat dropped on the griller, tongues of flame rose, adding a more tempting glow to the meat. The fruits were ripe and fresh. The little girl drooled at the sweet smell of their juice.

        Her eyes alight with excitement immediately, she flung off Osiris’s hand and pounced on the table of gourmet food before her. Putting her face close to the enticing food before her, she closed her eyes and took a deep breath without reaching out her hand and picking up the food the entire time.

        It was because souls couldn’t eat.

        Watching her from the back, Osiris found the little girl flashed a smile of satisfaction, as though her gaunt face had retrieved its liveliness. Whenever she finished looking around a store, she would raise her head to find her next target, then she would rush to it elatedly.

        A faint smile flickered across Osiris’s lips when he saw the delighted look on the little girl’s face, just as if he could also taste the delectable food. He slowly followed as he watched that little figure bouncing between the stalls.

        Suddenly, a short figure bolted before them. A man was startled that he lifted his barbecue plate and yelled, ‘Beat it! You filthy kid!’

        That figure disappeared at the end of an ally. The little girl’s expression abruptly changed; she stopped in the middle of the street and gazed at the depths of the ally. Darkness was no obscuration to Osiris’s sight. As he followed the direction of her gaze, he saw a skinny kid squatting in a corner and nibbling on rotten food hastily. With a madness of hunger, his hollow eyes darted them a baleful glance.

        The little girl averted her gaze right away back to the fancy food on a stall on her left. She then skipped lightly forward again. As though Osiris understood something, he followed her quietly again with a sigh.

        After passing through the humming street, they came to the gate of the town’s border, where they saw a vast and boundless desert. Under the moonlight, sand swirled like a layer of silvery tulle fluttering in the wind.

        Finally, the little girl stopped. Hanging her head low in the gentle breeze, she whispered softly, ‘I… can go with you now.’

        ‘Okay,’ Osiris replied gingerly. His eyes were filled with inexplicable sorrow and distress. Yet, the little girl gave him a radiant smile in a reassuring way—like the full moon in the sky, bright and complete—as though she sensed his despondency.

        ‘I’m okay. Don’t feel sorry for me.’ The little girl voluntarily took Osiris’s hand and followed him back to the magic circle. As she hopped her way lightly to that sparkling magic circle, her body glowed with the unique blue light of dead souls and gradually dissipated into dust.

        ‘For my whole life… I’ve never felt well-fed and contented.’ Her hair drifting in the breeze soon shattered into pieces of light. Turning her head, she looked back at Osiris and said softly, ‘Thank you.’

        With a smile, Osiris watched the deceased go in solemn silence. As that chapped fingertips and that little figure all turned into flickers of light, they gently touched Osiris’s face like falling petals.

        ‘May you have a better life after reincarnation.’ Reaching out his hand, he held one of the light pieces, which slightly wobbled on his palm. Soon, it was blown away again and immersed into darkness, turning into little starlight…</p>
