        <h1>Trapping Jaws - Armand</h1>
        <p>A felon who has been sentenced to 553 years in prison. 

As an expert at hunting, his favorite hobby is making jawed traps since he believes that the most beautiful sound in the world is the one when the trap closes and catches its prey.

He once hid in a forest and took pleasure in hunting passers-by. He would use a machete to dismember his prey after catching them. It is said that more than a thousand people have fallen victim to his gory desire.</p>
