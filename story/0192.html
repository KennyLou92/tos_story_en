        <h1>Poseidon, God of the Sea</h1>
        <p>        In the south was a peninsula watched over by two Gods.  Almost entirely surrounded by water, it had the advantage of abundant hauls in the seas; the plains at the shore was so fertile that it guaranteed substantial annual harvests.  The residents of the peninsula had migrated there from the cold and deserted north.  Their ancestors, upon realizing that the land possessed blessing from two Gods, decided they could establish a town in the middle of the south and the north.  There, they could enjoy both fishing advantages in the south and farming edges in the north.  Two temples worshipping the two Gods were respectively built on an embankment in the south and on a cliff in the north, in hopes that the Gods would bless the place forever.

        A few generations later, the land suffered from a drought, while the fish hauls drastically diminished; the townsmen were left unable to live.  One morning, a man led the fishermen of the town to the temple by the shore to recite their prayer.  “Oh, God of the Sea, we are your most faithful followers.  We pray that the deep sea can be free from poisonous plants, so that the fishermen can earn a living.”  As the man left his home with the fishermen, his wife also led the farmers to the temple on the cliff, reciting: “Goddess of Wisdom, you are our mistress.  We only wish for an everlasting supply of rainwater to fall on the earth, so that crops will never fail.”

        The fishermen and farmers ran into each other on their way back to their town.  With their rakes and harpoons pointed at each other, they criticized the opposing Gods, each claiming that the other God was casting evil to destroy the town.  They each insisted upon their own ways, declaring that the relationship between the two sides would end if the other side would not change their religion. 

        Already enraged, Poseidon slammed his trident on the sea; a horse rose from beneath the surface and galloped toward the country.  The fishermen knelt before the miracle; yet, as they saw a flood following closely behind the horse, they charged at the farmers with their harpoons in hand.  At the moment, a spear plummeted from the sky before thrusting into the ground, which then grew into an enormous olive tree.  The farmers held onto the trunk of the tree, steadying themselves while retaliating against the fishermen with their rakes.

        The residents in the town fought each other, taking pride in punishing the supposed traitors among friends and family alike.  However, the dispute between the two parties soon ended as all was consumed by the flood.  The Gods, left with no Humans to fight over, were forced to seek believers elsewhere.  Gods fought among themselves in the realm of Humans; the war was perpetual while intermittent.

        Before the war between Gods and Demons, Gods had inadvertently found the realm of Humans.  Coveting after the power of the Elder Gods, Zeus sent Gods to garrison the realm.  The Gods endowed blessings upon the people with their godly powers, bringing order to nature and ample harvests.  However, the comfortable life caused Human kings to deteriorate, and they left everything for the Gods to handle.  The Gods were infatuated with power and physical gains, so wars erupted between their worshippers claiming to be fighting on the Gods’ behalf.  Exploiting this opportunity, Demons developed their strength, forebodingly setting the stage of the later war between Gods and Demons.
