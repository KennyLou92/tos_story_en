        <h1>Line of Inspiration - Haydn</h1>
        <p>
                According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        From the moment of the Consonias’ birth, music had been everything to them; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        As the morning sunlight fell onto the bustling and elegant capital of music, Groove, the warm rays filtered through the curtains of a three-story house and gently roused a man from his slumber just as any usual day.

        The man, Haydn, calmly opened his eyes and began his daily routine—washing up, dressing, tidying his hair. Every movement was so perfect as though he were a pre-programmed machine. After smartening himself up, he opened the door and left his room. A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips as he detected a familiar scent—the smell of freshly brewed coffee drifting through the air, which brightened his mood and even made steps lighter.

        He went to the dining room and saw a woman placing two plates of hearty breakfast on the table. She turned to greet him upon hearing his footsteps, her captivating features brightened by a warm and affectionate smile.

        “Good morning, Haydn.”

        “Good morning, Paganini.” Haydn walked over and kissed her on the cheek before taking his seat. As usual, everything on the plate was his favorite: sourdough bread with cheese, a few rashers of crispy bacon on the side, and a steaming cup of freshly ground coffee.

        Paganini was Haydn’s lover. She always came to his home to share breakfast three days a week before they headed off for their usual orchestra rehearsals, and they would meet again for dinner at their usual restaurant at the end of the day.

        [i]What a perfectly stable and contented life.[/i]

        Haydn thought as he smiled and waved goodbye to Paganini before the auditorium. He then began another usual day as the conductor of the Chelidonian Winds Orchestra.

        Born from the seed of music, the Consonias held music in the highest regard, thus they had allocated a significant portion of social resources to support the operations of the Court of Music, a revered governing body formed by nine orchestras. While the court usually refrained from interfering in administrative affairs, it commanded absolute power when it came to major decisions.

        At the top of the Court of Music was Bach, the principal conductor of the Saint Fleur Orchestra, the Court’s first and most prestigious orchestra. Haydn, on the other hand, served as the conductor of the fourth orchestra, the Chelidonian Winds Orchestra. 

        Haydn assumed this day would be like any other—guiding young melodists, pointing out their mistakes, suggesting improvements, and eventually bringing his latest composition to life.

        However, something was different today.

        After the orchestra finished their first rehearsal of Haydn’s latest symphony, most of the melodists praised the beautiful and intricate composition, except for one who stood up, her unwavering gaze fixed on Haydn standing on the conductor’s podium.

        “Maestro Haydn, I find this new piece lacks a soul.” The bold critique came from a young and strikingly charming girl—Mozart. Her words sent a ripple of gasps and whispers through the hall.

        “Mozart… St-stop, okay?” a petite girl, younger than Mozart, timidly pleaded, tugging at her sleeve. It was Beethoven, trying to diffuse the tension. However, Mozart simply shook her hand off, undeterred as she continued, “The first to seventh measures of the violin section are identical to the twelve to eighteen measures of your sixth sonata. The eighth and twelfth measures resemble the thirty-six to forty-one measures of your twelfth symphony…”

        The sound of whispers gradually died down as Mozart gave her critique. Everyone was stunned by her photographic memory of Haydn’s works and her extraordinary ability to identify those similarities after hearing the latest piece just once.

        “...This isn’t a new composition at all,” Mozart concluded sharply. “It’s a patchwork of your previous works. It has no central theme, no soul—just emptiness!”

        Her conclusion plunged the entire hall into a dead silence in which one could have heard a pin drop, her words echoing around the room. No one dared say a word, fearing they might get caught in the invisible war between Mozart and Haydn. Meanwhile, Haydn, the subject of Mozart’s critique, remained silent, as though lost in thought.

        Finally, one melodist, finding Mozart’s statement rather unbearably audacious, broke the silence. “And so what? The music sounds good, and that’s all that matters! All you said was nothing but theoretical critique. Can you do something about it? You can’t, can you? ”

        “Can I do something about it?” Mozart repeated, finding the melodist’s question ridiculous. A smirk tugged at her lips, her tone dripping with sarcasm. “Let me show you.”

        She raised her violin and placed it gently on her shoulder. As she moved her arms, the bow touched the strings, and music began to flow in the hall. At first, no one understood her intention. However, it became clear after several measures—

        —Mozart was rewriting Haydn’s symphony on the spot!

        She restructured the symphony by removing redundant phrases and reordering the mismatched segments, strengthening the main melody with harmonies and deleting chaotic dissonance. Now with a more lively and dynamic rhythm, the music is infused with passion and energy. She had successfully recreated the piece and offered an innovative interpretation without losing Haydn’s signature style.

        Even those without a deep understanding of music could hear the stark contrast between the two versions; the Consonias, who revered music above all else, of course, could see the improvement. All melodists in the hall felt a rush of conflicting emotions—while they resented Mozart’s arrogance, they could not help but admire her unquestionable talent.


        Unable to confront their emotions, no one clapped when Mozart finished her performance and set down her violin. Silence reigned in the hall for a moment until someone clapped.

        Clap, clap, clap!

        To everyone’s astonishment, the applause came from the composer himself, Haydn. With a gentle smile, he gave Mozart genuine praise, “Bravo. Your performance was perfect, Mozart.”

        “We don’t have much time before next month’s performance,” Haydn said calmly. “Everyone, revise your scores according to Mozart’s version and we shall continue our rehearsal practicing afterward.”

        Haydn adopted Mozart’s version of the symphony, quietly diffusing the tension in the room. While some melodists felt the adoption was an imprudent decision, they had no grounds to judge or express their anger since the composer himself had said nothing against Mozart’s rearrangement. 

        The rehearsal ended uneventfully under a slightly awkward atmosphere. When Haydn pushed open the hall’s doors, Paganini, who had been waiting for him outside, approached him with a soft smile, “You’re late today. Was there a problem with your new composition?”

        “...Nothing. I’ve taken care of it,” Haydn replied with a smile, yet somehow he felt a void inside him. It was as if a layer of ice had formed around his heart, sealing his emotions, ever since Mozart had called his work soulless.

        He involuntarily shut down all his emotions to protect himself from falling apart. His mind seemed to have detached from his body. He watched himself joining Paganini at their usual restaurant and ordering their usual dishes, wearing a hollow smile throughout their conversation.

        Soon, their food arrived. The food was plated beautifully and tasted just as it always had.

        Delicious, yet devoid of surprise.

        Comforting, yet lacking excitement.

        Stable, yet uninspired.

        Everything that had once pleased him now felt bland, tasteless like wax.

        “The food here is just as delicious as it always is,” Paganini said cheerfully, oblivious to Haydn’s inner turmoil. Little did she know her words had struck a nerve with him.

        Everything they did was nothing but a re-experience of their past; nothing was new.

        ‘Everything is the same… same… A word that would be a compliment in other contexts perhaps—but in music, it’s an insult.’

        ‘Is this a reminder that I’ve lost my connection to music? That I’ve become an ordinary, uninspired musician?’

        ‘No… I won’t accept this… I can’t…’ Haydn struggled to breathe as the distressing realization dawned on him. It was as though he were drowning in an ocean, chased by a deadly wave called “despair.” He felt exposed, stripped bare like a man without armor, or perhaps like a fool, blissfully lost in the lie of happiness.

        ‘I’ve given my entire life to music. Without it, I’m nothing… And I can’t live without it!’

        Bang!

        Haydn’s suppressed frustration erupted as soon as he was back in his room. He slammed his fist into the mirror on the wall, causing cracks to spread across the surface.

        His distorted reflection stared back at him, red-rimmed eyes, clenching teeth—so pathetic, so foolish—an image that he desperately wanted to erase.

        From that day onward, Haydn, who realized the depths of his crisis, decisively threw himself entirely into music, locking himself away and devoting every waking moment to composing outside rehearsals. Yet music, cruelly unfair and indifferent, offered no rewards for his dedication. The more he tried, the deeper his despair grew, eventually turning into chains that held him down.

        ‘Why… why can’t I write something new?’
        ‘Mozart… She’s the real deal. She is who music has chosen…’
        ‘I can’t write anything… I’m nothing but a failure…’

        The more he failed to break through his creative block, the more he withdrew into isolation. The once well-groomed conductor became a haggard and unkempt man, living in frustration and self-doubt as days turned into weeks.

        One day, after yet another sleepless night spent agonizing over his compositions, Haydn finally collapsed into a restless slumber. When he awoke late in the afternoon, his weary gaze fell on the calendar. His mind, sluggish and clouded, suddenly found clarity.

        ‘Paganini… It’s her birthday today… I haven’t seen her in so long…’ The thought filled Haydn with guilt. For the first time in weeks, he set aside his creative struggles. He cleaned himself up, stepped out of his house, and bought a bouquet of fresh flowers, hoping to surprise his lover.

        He arrived at her house. Instead of ringing the doorbell, he used the spare key she had given him and entered quietly. It was dark in the living room, except for the glow of light spilling from the bedroom.

        ‘Could she already be asleep? But it’s barely dinnertime. She’s never gone to bed this early…’ A sense of foreboding crept up on Haydn as he approached the bedroom door. From within, he heard noises—breathy gasps, the rustling of sheets, and the unmistakable rhythm of bodies intertwining.

        The sounds struck him like an invisible thunderbolt, leaving him frozen in place. Trembling, he crept closer and peered through the crack only to witness a dreadful sight. On the bed, his lover, Paganini, lay entwined with a younger man, their naked bodies moving with wild passion. It was a side of her he had never seen—raw, untamed—which completely shattered his perception of her.

        Haydn knew he should have burst it, showed Paganini his fury, and demanded answers, but some invisible chains bound his legs when he tried to step forward. All the courage he had summoned evaporated in an instant, so he turned and fled. Yet, what he did not see, as he ran out of the house, was Paganini pulling away from the man. Her gaze, filled with both affection and sorrow, followed his figure into the night. 

        He stumbled into the streets, running aimlessly through the city. His breath came in short gasps as he collapsed onto the ground in exhaustion. His chest burned with anger and an icy despair. A storm of emotions raged within him, pouring on him like blades that tore his soul into pieces.

        ‘Why… Why would Paganini do this to me? Does she not love me anymore?’ Countless questions clawed at his mind. The pain and confusion crashed over him like relentless waves, driving him over the edge. Finally, he reached for the sigil on his skin. An ethereal piano materialized before him, floating in the air, and then he began to play, turning all those churning emotions into notes.

        Not a thought of harmony, structure, or melodic consistency came into Haydn’s mind in his spontaneous creation. Guided by emotion, he abandoned all the rules he had once lived by and played purely on instinct. It was a desperate cry for salvation through music, hoping it could become his anchor and ground him amidst the storm of anguish that threatened to drown him.

        Every note carried the weight of his emotions. Some were bold and thunderous, screaming with rage and frustration. Some were soft and mournful, whispering of heartbreak and sorrow. The melody rose and fell, laying bare his fury, despair, and grief for the world to hear.

        When Haydn finished the final note, he opened his eyes to find himself surrounded by a crowd, greeted with ripples of thunderous applause. It was nothing he had ever experienced before. Everyone clapped as they felt the storm of raw emotions through his music and resonated deeply with the pain he had poured into every sound.

        For so long, he had believed his inspiration had dried up, that his journey in music had come to an end. But now, in this moment of pain and despair, he realized: 

        [i]...Only through turmoil can I awaken my emotions and create something new…[/i]</p>
