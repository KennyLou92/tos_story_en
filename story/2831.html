        <h1>Hatred Ender - Rose</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.6

        In order to crush the rebellion of the outcasts, Rose and Nepenthes made a plan with Cornflower to capture all of them once and for all on the day of the Century Feast. Unexpectedly, Papaver used Strelitzia to sneak her army into the palace. Since the situation had changed, Cornflower and May Lily decided to split into two teams.

        Following Cornflower’s team, Rose and Nepenthes went to rescue Hyacinth. However, Papaver had already led her troop into Blossomville so Cornflower went to stop her while Nepenthes stayed at the place. In the meantime, Nepenthes sent Rose to find May Lily for help immediately.

        By the time Rose arrived at Strelitzia’s palace, May Lily had already headed to Blossomville. After knowing that Rosemellow had locked Strelitzia in a room, she helped break the door and saved the princess right before she was about to fall off the window.

        ‘Go save Sakura! Rosemellow has sent assassins to murder her!’ The drug and the fight with Rosemellow had completely exhausted Strelitzia that she uncontrollably passed out after telling Rose the news.

        “Oh no… Now that Madam Mysorensis is dead, Sakura is the only guardian of the Mother Tree. I must hurry!” Knowing how serious things had gotten, Rose hurried to where Sakura was with the elite soldiers.

        As soon as Rose stepped into the courtyard, she met a group of the outcasts. Amid the clanking swords, Rose, who remained safe under the soldiers’ protection, caught a glimpse of two outcasts running away from the battlefield under the cover of their companions; they were going straight to Sakura’s bedroom.

        “They must be the assassins! I have to stop them!” Rose gritted her teeth and chased after the two floral-elves. As much as the soldiers wanted to follow her, the outcasts got in the way so they could only watch Rose disappear into the hallway.

        ‘Ha… They… They run… so fast…’ Even though Rose ran desperately while holding her dress, she was still unable to catch up with the elves but only watched them break into Sakura’s bedroom. By the time she made it there, an elf was already aiming her dagger at the sleeping Sakura.

        “Ding it!” Like a cat on a hot tin roof, Rose was so anxious that she rashly picked up a brick on the ground and threw it at the two elves. Miraculously, the brick hit the back of the male floral-elf’s head.

        ‘Ouch!’ The male floral-elf let out a groan of pain. He turned around to look who attacked him, only to see another stone flying toward his face. Luckily, the female floral-elf beside him was quick enough to deflect the stone with a dagger.

        Enraged by Rose’s attacks, the male floral-elf strode to her. As he swiftly grabbed her hands, he gave her a knee strike on her knees to make her kneel on the ground. Then he put his dagger against her neck and asked in a stern tone, ‘Who are you?’

        ‘Are you stupid?’ The female floral-elf sneered. She walked to Rose and pulled her waist-length hair violently, and said, ‘Look at her silky and shiny hair. That only belongs to those overly pampered noble elves.’

        ‘Tut!’ Smacking his tongue in disgust, the male floral-elf gave Rose a sharp slap so vigorously that made her face swell up immediately. ‘It’s all because the trash elves like you that we have to live in misery!’

        ‘No…’ Rose murmured softly with her head hanging low. Her voice was so weak that it sounded almost inaudible for the male assassin who reflexively bent over to hear her better without noticing how close he had gotten to Rose. That was why he failed to avoid Rose’s head-butt when she abruptly raised her head. The awful pain in his chin forced him to let out a shrill scream and loosened his grip on her with the dagger in his hand falling to the ground.

        ‘What… Ah!’ Taken aback by Rose’s sudden attack, the female assassin hurriedly grabbed Rose’s hair but her attempt was meant to be vain since Rose had already grasped the dagger and swung it upward—

        —Swish! Rose cut off her hair with the dagger to free herself from the female floral-elf’s restraint. Then she immediately grabbed the arm of the male flower-elf who was still groaning in pain. Putting her right foot forward, she flipped him over her shoulder so neatly and threw him precisely at the female elf, knocking the both of them down at once.

        With a flick of her uneven short hair, Rose victoriously looked down at the unconscious assassins on the ground and said aloud, ‘I am a noble elf but I’m not the trash you said, just as I know not all the outcasts are bastards like you two!’

        Afterward, Rose tied the two assassins up with some bed sheets in case they would attack her and Sakura again. Just when she was going to take them out of Sakura’s bedroom, she heard a grunt of pain from the bed.

        ‘Mm…’

        Rose hurriedly ran to the bed only to find that Sakura was tossing and turning instead of sleeping soundly. Her face was sickly pale and her forehead was beaded with cold sweat, as if she was suffering from great pain.

        ‘No… Everyone will sink into misery… I have to… Mm!’

        ‘Huh?! Wait! What… What is happening?!’ Rose paced the room nervously. When she finally decided to call the doctor , she saw something shining on the bedside.

        “That is… the guardian’s staff!” Rose took the staff which was made of intertwined vine with a gallery of pink cherry blossom petals on the top that held a handful of limpid water. In the center was a clear crystal that was shedding a scorching pink light.

        “I can feel the power of the Mother Tree from the light… Could it be Sakura calling for the Mother Tree’s power…? I can’t figure it out! What the hell! Things can’t be worse anyway, let me just give it a try!”

        Holding the staff, Rose walked to Sakura and poured the limpid water into her mouth…
