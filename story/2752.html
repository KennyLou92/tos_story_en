        <h1>Autocratic Pretensions - Ying Zheng</h1>
        <p>        In a golden hall of magnificence, where red beams were engraved with phoenixes and sandalwood was chiseled with dragons, spirals of smoke rose from an auspicious animal censer slowly to the dais high above.

        Leaning against the extravagant throne erected on the dais, Ying Zheng was looking down with his right hand fiddling with the glittering ring of white jade on his thumb. Yet, his leisurely posture made all the courtiers who were kneeling below even more nervous. 

        ‘How is the barbarian state in the west?” asked Ying Zheng unemotionally. 

        One of the courtiers replied respectfully, “Your majesty, our mighty army broke through the enemy’s palace five days ago and captured their ruler alive. He is now imprisoned, waiting for your judgment.”

        “I heard that the ruler of the west is a true hero with an unyielding mind. I would like to see him.” Ying Zheng lifted his head and said, “Bring him here.”

        Soon, a man was sent to the hall under guard by two soldiers. Although the man looked haggard, his eyes were still shining with unbending will. When they came to the end of the hall, the soldiers asked the man to kneel down yet the latter refused to do so. The soldiers still failed even after they tried to press him by force.

        Just when the soldiers were about to draw their swords and threaten the man, Ying Zheng stopped them with a wave of his hand. He then stood up from the dragon chair, walked down the stairs serenely, and came to the king of the west, ignoring the dissuasion from his courtiers.

        “No prostration?” asked Ying Zheng.
        “No.”
        “Good.” Instead of getting angry, Ying Zheng flashed him an intriguing smile and said, “Men, go gather all the children under ten in the west and off with their heads by tomorrow morning.”

        Ying Zheng’s order aroused exclamations of shock and voices of discussion around the hall. Yet no one dared to admonish him, except the king of the west state who dashed forward and grabbed Ying Zheng’s shoulders and growled, “You——You monster! Kill me as you like. Leave the children alone!”

        “By killing you, I would be just giving you what you want, but killing the children can drive you mad so it’s worth it.” As Ying Zheng pushed the king aside, he asked again after a deliberate pause, “Still no prostration?”

        “You—” With his eyes wide open, the king of the western state gritted his teeth as if he would rip Ying Zheng’s throat off the next second. Seeing his scowling face, the courtiers standing aside shrank in fear; whereas Ying Zheng stayed put with a sardonic smile and watched as the man’s mounting rage gradually subsided and eventually disappeared.

        Pop——the king of the western state went down on his knees, put his arms forward with his head against the ground, and prostrated himself to Ying Zheng. However, Ying Zheng still shook his head discontentedly and said, “Not enough.”

        “...Long live the emperor.” Losing its vigor, the king’s voice was weak and powerless like an underdog.

        The confrontation ended with Ying Zheng’s crushing victory. Nevertheless, the victory was not as gratifying as Ying Zheng had imagined but rather pale and insipid.

        ‘The so-called true hero is nothing greater than that.’ With a flick of his sleeves, Ying Zheng headed back to his bedchamber, leaving the courtiers and the kind of the west state. Yet, he stopped the moment he set foot in the door. There was nothing strange in his sight but the experience he had gained through years was telling him that something was off in the room.

        Stilly, Ying Zheng looked around the chamber. His whole body tensed up but soon relaxed when he caught a glimpse of the purple tail hanging behind the partition. He then looked up at the ceiling where a four-headed violet dragon coiled himself around the beams, looking down on Ying Zheng with a satirical smile. It seemed he wanted to see him embarrass himself but he failed his expectation. 

        “What are you doing out here?” asked Ying Zheng composedly.

        “I didn’t swallow souls for nothing through all these years. I was only trapped in your little white bottle because I was injured. Now that I’ve recovered, it can’t trap me anymore.” Violet Dragon—Xuan Huang the Runedragon—flew to Ying Zheng and squinted at him, saying, “But worry not. For the contract we’ve made, I won’t hurt you.”

        “Since you are healed now, why don’t you leave?”
        “Of course I’ll leave, but I still have some unfinished business.”
        “What is it?”

        “...I need pure souls to cure my Souliade.” Perhaps it was that his wound had been healed; or that he thought Ying Zheng was no threat, Xuan Huang surprisingly let his guard down and answered Ying Zheng’s question.

        ‘Souliade?’
        “To put it in the easiest way with human words, he’s kind of like my twin brother.”
        “What happened to him?”

        “He was seriously injured in a war against some powerful monster years ago. He could have healed himself with elements by taking ample rest. However, given the unstable flow of elements, it may take years for him to heal. That’s why I came to the human realm for pure souls to cure him but—” As if there was a lump in Xuan Huang’s throat, he paused and only continued after a moment, “It’s none of your business. You just keep getting me pure souls.”

        “...So your clan is very strong?”
        “Humph, of course, far stronger than the fragile humans.”

        ‘The world of the strong… What will it be like if I become the king…’ thought Ying Zheng, lowering his eyes. A thought was born at that moment. With the nourishment of time, it gradually grew and became a desire that Ying Zheng could not turn his back on; he eventually took action to achieve it.

        Dozens of little girls and boys were sent to the main hall, all tied up. Sitting on his throne, Ying Zheng kept a poker face, whereas Xuan Huang behind him could barely hide his excitement.

        ‘I will have enough power to awaken Bai Hu as soon as I swallow this batch of souls.’ Swaying his towering body, Xuan Huang wandered among the children while devouring the souls he had drawn out one by one. Then dozens of breathing lives turned into stiff corpses in the blink of an eye.

        “Finally… I finally made it… Ying Zheng, now it’s time we part…AHHHHH—!” Suddenly, an inexplicable and excruciating pain shot through Xuan Huang from his soul, so excruciating that he could not help but scream and fell to the ground for his lack of strength.

        ‘Something is gnawing at my soul… Could it be—!’ Xuan Huang raised his head and looked at the man on the dragon chair. With his eyes turning crimson in hatred, he clenched his teeth and yelled, “The Soul-eating Gu... You planted the gu poison on them!”

        “Bingo. Unfortunately, it’s too late,” said Ying Zheng with a pleased smile, who seemed to be happy about his successful plan.

        “You… You…bastard…” Xuan Huang struggled desperately. However, his soul was soon gnawed off by dozens of Soul-eating Gu. The brightness of his dragon eyes gradually dimmed as his mind began to fade.

        “You once asked me what I am, didn’t you?” Ying Zheng walked down from the throne and came to Xuan Huang, looking down at him for the first time.

        “Mon…ster… You’re…a monster…” At the very last moment, Xuan Huang uttered a few words as soft as a whisper. His voice was so weak that one could hardly hear but Ying Zheng somehow just knew what he was saying.

        “No, I… I will be the ruler of heaven that dominates everything.” The moment when Ying Zheng made his claim, Xuan Huang’s entire soul was devoured by the Gu and his eye lost their gleam completely.

        As Ying Zheng closed his eyes and started chanting the runes, his soul turned into dense dark smoke and went inside Xuan Huang’s body…</p>
