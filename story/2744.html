        <h1>Guide of Morn - Tristan</h1>
        <p>Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.6

        Following Tristan’s lead, Arthur and her friends found the temple where the holy grail was but they were blocked by the enchantment. Luckily, Merlin solved the problem and was given two Star Stones from the follower of the holy grail. 

        However, luck doesn’t always turn around. They were caught in the ambush of Mordred’s army. In the end, Lancelot was brainwashed and Arthur was seriously injured. To help the others defuse the crisis, Guinevere disguised herself as Arthur with the help of Merlin’s magic and surrendered herself to Mordred.

        Tristan and his companions survived. After they consolidated, they decided to sneak into the palace to stop Mordred’s evil deeds. Gawain and Tristan were responsible for finding the last Star Stone in the palace yet they encountered Lancelot, who was controlled by black magic, half the way. Gawain stayed and fought against Lancelot to make a way for Tristan.

        Tristan walked along the spiral staircase to the upper floor and found a difference between the map and the actual hallway-it was much narrower than the one downstairs. He observed and puzzled out that, ‘there must be a hidden space! Be it a secret tunnel or a secret room, there must be a trace of it!’ 

        Tristan immediately groped around the stone wall. Eventually, he found a switch and opened the hidden door, in which he saw a cavernous hall with pennants hanging on both sides. Next to the stone pillars stood a row of bookshelves and armor with portraits hanging on the wall. Under the stained glass in front of him, there was a round table on which laid a Star Stone.

        “It’s the Star Stone! I have to take it to Gawain as soon as possible!”

        Tristan ran towards the round table. On his way, suddenly, a magic circle appeared at the tip of his foot. A misty purple stream seeped out of the circle and ran through the hall. Then a disturbing metal grinding noise came from all corners. Tristan felt an inexplicable chill down his spine and instinctively stepped back.

        Crack! Flashes of sharp blades came and thrust into the spot where Tristan just stood!

        “It’s a trap. It attacks once I step into the magic zone… Darn it! I’m so close… I can’t just give up!”

        Suppressing his worries, Tristan looked around the hall calmly. The rapidly moving eyes eventually landed on a standing bookshelf. A thought crossed his mind. Then he ran over, got all the books off the shelf and cautiously pushed the shelf towards the direction where he just walked to.

        The magic circle engraved on the ground was activated again with the terrifying metal sound. Leaning against the shelf, Tristan moved with his eyes shut——Crack! The blades came again yet landed on the shelf this time.

        “I did it! I knew the trap was fixed! As long as I know the trap spot, I can break through it with the barrier made with the things in this hall!”

        Clenching his fists, Tristan no longer hesitated and tested the trap spots one by one speedily. Soon he made a small intricate maze by moving the bookshelves, sofa and armor.

        ‘I-I’ve made it…’ Tristan scratched the cloth on his chest nervously. He had been only studying the maps made by others in depth for the past years but now he was creating a word of his own.

        He took a deep breath and made a start. As the magic circle was activated again, various sounds traveled through the hall with different sharp weapons darting from each direction, which were all stopped by the tortuous maze. Under the protection of the maze, Tristan managed to get to the round table and hold up the Star Stone.

        Before Tristan could unwind his excitement, a deafening boom from the outside wavered his heart again.

        “That’s from the main castle! I have to hurry and take the Star Stone to Gawain!”

        Tristan bagged up the Star Stone and hastily left the room. The moment he stepped out of the room, a dark metal armored soldier came. Just as the soldier was about to wield his sword and gash Tristan, a figure rushed over and shoved the soldier away with a shield.

        ‘Tristan, are you alright?’ A familiar male voice let Tristan’s guard down. As he opened his eyes and looked, he let out a scream in surprise, ‘Lamorak!’

        ‘I just saw Bedivere and Arthur riding a lion to the palace hall. Something must have happened with that boom. Let’s hurry!’

        ‘Ok!’ Without further ado, Tristan followed Lamorak and ran towards the palace hall. Gripping the Star Stone above his chest with his right hand, he silently prayed in his heart.

         “Arthur! Don’t die before I give you the Star Stone!”</p>
