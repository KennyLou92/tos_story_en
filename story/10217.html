        <p>
        Sent as an emissary from space to rule over Strike World when she was still a baby.
After descending from space and finally accomplishing her mission to conquer Strike World, Nostradamus founded the Nostra Kingdom, anointing herself the "Great Queen of Fear" and reigned proudly as its ruler. After appointing Angolmois as her head minister, she had him read out the proclamation declaring the founding of the kingdom, which boasted of Nostradamus's prophecies regarding the founding of the kingdom, Nostradamus becoming its ruler, as well as a myriad of other fulfilled prophecies.</p>
