        <h1>Shroy Zagudy</h1>
        <p>His parents died in an accident during his childhood. Helpless, he was later placed in the "Blue Bird Orphanage". With an innocent face, Shroy has a much different personality from his appearance, crafty and sensitive. He is kind in nature, even though he is reluctant in words but he will still lend a helping hand when he sees someone in need.</p>
