        <h1>Vanquisher of Indulgence - Metatron</h1>
        <p>
                It had taken Metatron much effort simply to drive Indulgent Angeloid out of a mortal; but unexpectedly, he had not been able to seize the moment and catch her.  All he could do was watch on as she fled into the forest.  Threading his way through the forest, he carefully observed his surroundings.  Just then, a green light sphere flashed across his face; he agilely grabbed Indulgent Angeloid, who was  inside the sphere.  At the moment when their hands touched, everything in the surroundings faded into darkness.  He calmly walked towards the sole light in the darkness...

        Metatron saw the young “him” from his childhood and a lively little bird.  At that time, he saved an injured bird and looked after it with tender care.  To prevent its injury from getting worse, he directly fed it from his hands so that the bird did not have to move around to eat; he wrapped its wings with bandages so that it would not hurt itself again by flying.  Yet, the small bird suddenly died!  At that time, depression had consumed him; he had sat alone under a tree, crying in silence.  He also piled soils up to make a small dune.  

        “Why?  Everything I did was for the good of the bird!”  The young him had tears running down his cheeks.  He could not figure out why the little bird had seemed dispirited, and why it had suddenly died. 

        At that moment, Metatron abruptly realized that after the bird had recovered, he had indulged his overbearing love; this had caused the bird to lose all its foraging instincts.  Even when it spread its wings, it did not know how to fly.  His controlling nature had cost the little bird of its freedom.  It died from deep sorrow for it had lost its purpose to live!  Metatron felt guilt for the little bird’s death, for his way of “loving” the bird had been wrong.  Metatron approached the trembling younger “him,” crouched down and gently put the arm on his shoulder, said... 

        “In fact, overbearing attention does not signify love.  You cannot win the hearts with force.  This can only be achieved by your own virtue.” 

        The virtuality dispersed as he spoke.  At that moment, the younger “him” who Metatron put his arm around transformed into Indulgent Angeloid before fading into glittering lights which melted into Metatron’s chest.  He felt calm and warm from a gentleness spreading out from his heart.  Metatron smiled from the bottom of his heart as if his mind and soul was healed... </p>
