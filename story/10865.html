        <h1>Roswaal L Mathers</h1>
        <p>He is a noble who is known as the Margrave in the Kingdom of Lugunica, serving as the guardian of Emilia, one of the Royal Candidates.
As the Head Court Magician, he is one of the foremost magicians widely known in the kingdom. However, he comes across as an eccentric and flamboyant man due to his bizarre behaviors, peculiar comments, and clown-like makeup, which rather spoil his impressive title.</p>
