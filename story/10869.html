        <h1>Garfiel Tinsel</h1>
        <p>He is a young man with a fierce gaze and sharp fangs. He has a quick-tempered and barbaric personality that matches his menacing appearance. Having a distinctive way of speaking, he often teases Subaru with peculiar proverbs.
As the guardian of the Sanctuary, he initially opposes Subaru, but he later sees Subaru as an elder brother figure and joins Emiliaâ€™s party after they reconcile. Blessed with the Divine Protection of Earth Spirits, which enables him to draw power from the earth, he can transform into a giant tiger.</p>
