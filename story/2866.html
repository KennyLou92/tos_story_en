        <h1>Repentant Hero - Lan Caihe</h1>
        <p>
                Lan Caihe had a nightmare—he kept having flashbacks of himself blasting Guang Yangzi off the holy mountain. Yet, the strangest was that he saw Guang Yangzi again in his dream and the other had become the leader of a cult…

        Startled by the sound of footsteps and a faint glimmer of light, Lan Caihe was abruptly awakened from his dream. He groggily regained consciousness, only to discover a figure approaching him.

        Standing before Lan Caihe was none other than Guang Yangzi, whom he had believed to be long dead.

        Guang Yangzi stared at Lan Caihe with an icy gaze. His eyes looked different, replaced by a pair of unfamiliar golden vertical pupils that made Lan Caihe realize a fact—

        “You are not Guang Yangzi. Who are you? ” Lan Caihe questioned. 

        “I have long taken possession of his body,” said “Guang Yangzi”, rolling up his sleeve to reveal a vivid snake-shaped pattern on his arm.

        As Lan Caihe gazed upon the pattern, memories flooded back to him. He recalled an incident from the past where Guang Yangzi had been wounded by a snake monster while trying to save him. The wounds left Guang Yangzi a peculiar scar that was remarkably similar to the pattern now before his eyes. At that moment, everything began to connect in Lan Caihe’s mind.

        “You are the snake monster…”

        The question that had been lingering in Lan Caihe’s mind was finally answered. The realization that Guang Yangzi’s body had been possessed by the snake monster fueled Lan Caihe’s anger.

        The mounting rage compelled Lan Caihe to summon his golden fan. As he moved his fan, his inky Xian energy coalesced into a dozen arrows and shot at the snake monster. However, all the arrows vanished before reaching the prison door as if they were blocked by an invisible barrier.

        “Stop wasting your time. I have built a barrier around here. It is sustained by the life force of my countless followers. Even your godly weapon can’t break through it,” the snake monster sneered, pointing toward the magic circle surrounding Lan Caihe.

        “What exactly do you want?” Lan Caihe demanded. 

        “I want the Heavenly Kingdom,” said the snake monster with fanatical greed in its eyes. It then continued, “Why should you Xians live in the bountiful Heavenly Kingdom and do your spiritual self-cultivation, while we are forced to dwell in barren lands? It is unjust! I will conquer the Heavenly Kingdom and take back everything that rightfully belongs to our clan!” As the snake monster spoke, the madness in its eyes grew.

        “You will never succeed,” Lan Caihe responded calmly.

        “Don’t worry. I will let you live until you witness the demise of the entire Heavenly Kingdom, and I will kill you when you sink into the depths of despair, as a payback for what you did to me back then, deporting me to the human realm,” the snake monster said with a cold grin before it walked out of the prison.

        “Anyway, I have to get out of here. To do it, I have to break the barrier… Since I can’t break it from the inside, then I’ll find a way to open it from the outside.” A smirk appeared on Lan Caihe’s lips as an idea came into his head. Raising his golden fan, he twirled it around his body to conjure a cloak consisting of his Xian energy. When the cloak faded away, he assumed the appearance of Guang Yangzi.

        Then, Lan Caihe began to bump into the cell door repeatedly, creating a loud noise that eventually caught someone’s attention. Soon, a man approached the cell, and it was the man who had brought Lan Caihe here in the beginning.

        “What’s all the commotion—” the man questioned impatiently. However, as soon as he saw Lan Caihe’s appearance, the look on his face turned into one of astonishment, and he exclaimed, “S-Saint… How did you end up trapped in the cell?”

        Pretending to be weak, Lan Caihe leaned against the wall as he looked at the man. He spoke softly, “I fell into his trap… That Xian tricked me into the cell and knocked me unconscious… Just open the door first.”

        “Of course!” The man, mistaking Lan Caihe as the real leader, opened the cell door. He even stepped forward to help Lan Caihe only to be struck by the latter with a blow, losing his consciousness without letting a groan.

        “It’s time to make that monster pay,” Lan Caihe whispered under his breath. As calm as he appeared to be, the bloodlust and rage in his eyes revealed his true emotions.

        After casting a glance at the unconscious man,  Lan Caihe summoned his golden fan once again. As he slided it across his body, an murky radiance shone, and when it dissipated, he had taken on the appearance of the man. He then hid the unconscious man. With a single breath, he replicated the man’s demeanor.

        With his new disguise, Lan Caihe ran up to the hall and shouted when he saw the snake monster, “Saint! The Xian in the prison has disappeared!”

        “How is that possible!”  Taken aback by the news, the snake monster immediately turned around to rush toward the prison, exposing its back, completely defenseless. Lan Caihe took the opportunity to summon his golden feather fan, thrusting it with all his might toward the snake monster’s back.

        However, in that instant, the snake monster who sensed the wind breaking behind quickly turned around and grabbed hold of the fan with both hands, preventing Lan Caihe from pulling it out. The fan cut into the snake monster’s palms, blood dripping through its fingers.

        “How dare you pretend to be my follower and attack me. You Xians truly are cunning… I should kill you now to eliminate any future troubles!”

        The snake demon’s intense killing intent surged within a moment as a vast amount of power converged around it.

        Lan Caihe instinctively sensed the danger and tried to retreat to evade the attack. However, his feet had been entangled by numerous small snakes, rendering him immobile.

        Seizing the opportunity, the snake monster unsheathed the sword on its waist and swung it toward the helpless Lan Caihe.

        In such a despairing moment, a golden light burst forth from within the snake monster, causing the sword to tremble as it stopped in front of Lan Caihe.

        As Lan Caihe looked up, he found the snake monster’s eyes shifting between vertical and black pupils.

        “It’s you… General…” Within those black pupils, Lan Caihe caught a glimpse of the gentle and resolute gaze that belonged to the real Guang Yangzi.

        “I have waited for this moment for so long… Hurry, kill me!” The remaining fragment of Guang Yangzi’s soul hoarsely shouted.

        “How dare you… Damn it! I… I shall kill both of you!” the snake monster roared in anger.
　　
        “I won’t let you!”  Suppressing the overwhelming emotions in his heart, Lan Caihe summoned his Xian energy, gathering it on his golden fan. With a forceful swing, a beam of ink-like radiance pierced through Guang Yangzi’s chest, and a plume of black smoke dissipated from within his body while emitting a scream.

        “Thank you…” Guang Yangzi whispered, his voice carrying a hint of relief.

        “Take care, General.” Lan Caihe watched as Guang Yangzi’s body gradually turned into dust and dissipated into the air.

        Later, Lan Caiher reported to the Celestial Commander on the events upon returning to the Heavenly Kingdom. In the end, the cult was taken care of by other Xian generals and the traitor Guang Yangzi had redeemed his name as a benevolent Xian in the Heavenly Kingdom history…</p>
