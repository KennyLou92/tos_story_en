        <h1>Yomi</h1>
        <p>
        Yomi is the youngest among the Three Kings.  He is a calm and patient demon, who can read opponent’s moves in advance and take appropriate actions.  Therefore, he is portrayed as a intelligent yet ambitious character.  After losing his sight during the attack by an assassin, Yomi’s senses of hearing and smell have become extraordinarily sensitive that he could even hear all the things within his kingdom, including heartbeat. </p>
