        <h1>Crimson Serenade - Elizabeth</h1>
        <p>
                In a forsaken town, where the moonless night stretched to the horizon, casting an eerie darkness that intensified the unsettling silence, dilapidated buildings stood like invisible beasts warning any intruders to stay away from this forgotten land.

        Still, someone ventured into the treacherous heart of the abandoned town regardless of the ominous ambiance—a couple, holding hands, strolled through the town’s entrance.

        The young man with emerald hair wore a vibrant yellow tailcoat meticulously coordinated with a pristine bowtie and a boutonniere, which stood out vividly in the dark like a radiant sun. The woman by his side, on the other hand, wore a rather understated attire—a midnight blue evening gown adorned with subtle golden embroidery that exuded an air of refined elegance.

        Their lavish attire seemingly suggested they were heading to the most extravagant party rather than to the depths of a desolate town.

        “Jack, why did you bring me here?” Elizabeth, the woman, asked, her voice filled with curiosity.

        “Today is the anniversary of our first date, so I have prepared a surprise for you,” Jack replied, lifting Elizabeth’s hand to gently place a kiss on her knuckles. 

        “Well, you know the consequences if you fail to surprise me,” Elizabeth teased, flashing a sweet smile at Jack as she playfully grazed his chin, leaving a trace of blood.

        Instead of showing any sign of anger, Jack caressed the bloodstain with a mesmerized expression as he whispered, “You can do anything you want to me.”

        The young man, Jack, was not only a detective but also an artist with a morbid fascination for death. The woman, Elizabeth, was a noble who attained eternal youth through the fresh blood of young maidens.

        In the past, Jack had been commissioned by some villagers to find the missing girls in the village. It was during the investigation that he encountered Elizabeth, the culprit, and fell deeply in love with her at first sight. The two’s passionate romance blossomed swiftly, but the intense emotions flooded Elizabeth with worries, followed by a clash of values. In a moment of turmoil, Elizabeth accidentally took Jack’s life.

        After numerous hardships, Jack managed to resurrect and leave the underworld. It was after a long and winding journey that he finally regained his memories of Elizabeth. He returned to her side and shared a sweet and happy life ever since.

        And today, like any other of their sweet and happy days, Jack led Elizabeth into the forsaken town. They walked through narrow alleyways, one after another, until they reached a dilapidated estate where the remnants of the building still hinted at its past grandeur.

        “We’re almost there,” Jack said, gracefully bending down at the foot of a staircase, offering his hand for Elizabeth to hold as they descended. They passed through a half-blocked doorway before arriving at a vast garden.

        Despite the absence of a gardener, the garden thrived, bursting with vibrant colors as flowers bloomed in a riotous display. Their hues contrasted beautifully with the twinkling stars in the boundless night sky, captivating the beholders’ eyes.

        Unfortunately, the picturesque scene was marred by a lifeless body lying at the heart of the blossoms.

        “So…is this part of your surprise as well?” Elizabeth asked.

        “No, it is not,”  Jack replied, his face immediately darkened as he approached the lifeless form for closer inspection.

        It was the body of a boy,  approximately seven or eight years old. His limbs were twisted at unnatural angles and his skin was covered in horrifying bruises, all evident that he had suffered brutal torture before meeting his untimely demise.

        ‘What a grotesque scene of death. The perpetrator must be incurably repugnant…’ Jack’s mood further darkened at the sight of such an inelegant death.

        “The body is still warm, which indicates that the boy died recently. The murderer must still be around,” Jack concluded

        “Are you going to bring him out?” Elizabeth asked.

        “Of course,” Jack replied with a rarely cold and menacing look as he continued, “He ruined my surprise for you with such an unpleasant body. That’s unforgivable!”

        “Don’t be angry, my dear.” As captivating as the look of rage on Jack’s face, Elizabeth could not bear to see him upset, so she gently put her arms around his neck from behind and whispered to his ear softly, “Let me help you.”

        As Elizabeth tapped into her powers, blood burst forth from her body, spreading and solidifying as it converged in one direction. Within moments, the blood returned with a ragged middle-aged man hung at its end that had transformed into a crimson hook.

        “Wh-what do you want? Le-let go of me!” The man struggled and roared desperately.

        “Give you the punishment you deserve, of course,”  Jack said, stepping forward and placing a small knife against the man’s throat, “You’ve ruined our surprise date and the audacity you showed me that repulsive sight.” A disarming and devilish smile curled upon his lips as he pressed his hand downward—

        “ARGHHHH!” A piercing scream echoed throughout the abandoned estate. It was a shrill and resonant cry but it quickly died away, turning into feeble groans, and eventually, subsided into silence.

        “Phew. Another masterpiece,”  Jack said, looking at his art with excitement. He turned to face Elizabeth, awaiting her evaluation.

        “It’s fantastic. I knew my Jack is the most remarkable man in this world,” Elizabeth expectedly praised her beloved without hesitation. Just as she was about to hold him in an embrace, Jack suddenly restrained his excitement. Giving Elizabeth a knowing glance, he whispered, “I hear something.”

        Elizabeth immediately hushed, her ears attuning to the faint sound of suppressed weeping coming from the upper floors of the manor. Exchanging a glance, they ventured into the crumbling manor and cautiously walked up the precarious spiral staircase. Finally, they reached a room at the end of the corridor on the second floor, where the sorrowful cries grew closer.

        Jack pushed open the wobbly door only to find several children bound by ropes. The children recoiled in fear, seeking refuge in the corner of the room the moment they saw Jack.

        “Don’t be afraid. It’s all over now,” Jack spoke in a gentle tone to soothe the children. His demeanor was unexpectedly tender, leaving Elizabeth momentarily stunned.

        Afterward, Jack and Elizabeth escorted the children back to the police station in the nearby town.  By the time everything was settled, dawn had already broken. Holding Elizabeth’s hands, Jack spoke, his handsome face filled with profound remorse, “I’m sorry, Elizabeth. I’m sorry for letting my surprise for you turn into a fright instead.”

        “It’s alright,” Elizabeth shook her head, hesitating for a moment before asking the question she had harbored, “Jack, do you…do you want children?”

        Jack appeared surprised. “Why ask?”

        “I noticed how you became infuriated at the sight of the boy’s corpse, and how gentle you were with the children. Besides, you’re always with Ed, so I know you like children and enjoy being around them. But my body is incapable of bearing a child… ” Elizabeth struggled before finally mustering her courage and continued, “If having children is what you dream of, you can go—”

        Before Elizabeth could finish her sentence, Jack placed a finger over her lips. Gazing deeply into her eyes, he spoke with tenderness and affection, “I don’t need children. I don’t need anything that might divert your love away from me. Elizabeth, all I need is for you to love, solely me, until eternity.”

        “Jack…” Elizabeth gave a soft chuckle, wrapping her arms around Jack’s waist. She murmured blissfully, “You’re right. I was in my own head. We don’t need anyone else. We just let our love burn like the most fervent flame until the very end of the world.”</p>
