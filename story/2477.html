        <h1>Resentment Awakening - Enlil</h1>
        <p>
                Inside the base of Eldus the aliens on the ancient Continent Tarones, there was a female Eldus named Enlil sleeping on her working station. However, her deep frown and sleep talks could tell that she was haunted by nightmares…

        “I can evaluate everything but you in the entire universe…”

        In the hazy dream, Enlil heard a pleasant male voice. The speaker, an unearthly gorgeous man, reached out to stroke her cheek. 

        “So you're my one and only weakness,” said the man with a deep affection, squinting his brilliant golden eyes.

        Enlil felt copious sentiments flowing in her veins as the man spoke. She knew clearly that this persona here loved the man with its life and soul.

        The scene changed suddenly, turning into somewhere Enlil was familiar with——Akkad the home planet of Eldus.

        “This is the rooftop of the research institute…”

        While Enlil was pondering, a bone-chilling scene happened right in front of “her” watch——that man was stabbed by a female Eldus on his left chest.

        “You betray me because of your own desire...” The man murmured in a weak voice as life was slipping away from his body.

        “I was unable to observe you in the past. But from now on, I'll never observe you again...”

        “Ah...No…” Enlil was shattered by a tremendous despair and soul-wrecking agony. “No no no! Don’t leave me! La...Laplace!”

        Yet her yell was swallowed by a deep-rooted darkness. In her dream, she was bathing in some kind of fluid, with the power of destruction from the origin extracted and sealed inside the container behind her.

        “She” was aware that her body was capable of performing a complete mimicry, but “she” didn’t do so, as if this deformed body was a punishment and a stigma to keep her from forgetting the grudge.

        The entire room was illuminated after a long period of darkness. Meanwhile, a lady approached slowly.

        “That’s...madam Manungal…”

        Enlil recognised the visitor. Just when she was going to talk to her, the container imprisoning her launched fierce spell attacks at her——

        “AHH——!”

        Enlil heard herself screaming painfully in the dream, but her voice was hoarse like rocks rubbing each other.

        “Don’t look at me like that, alien.”

        The exquisite face of Manungal carried no sentiment.

        “Saint is kind to everything, but I don’t care about others’ pain as long as it brings me the answer,” said Manungal coldly.

        “Hate...I hate you all...Eldus...You took away my hope...I’ll kill you all...including the glory you all are proud of...I’ll destroy them ALL!” The “Enlil” said resentfully.

        “Really?”

        Manungal raised her wand to conjure a spell.

        “I’m looking forward to that.”

        “AHHHHH————!”

        Sense of pain that resembled body dismemberment was sent to the deepest of Enlil’s soul, making her scream hysterically.

        “Enlil! Enlil! Wake up!”

        A man spoke worriedly, waking Enlil up from the deep sleep.

        “Hmm...Marduk...What’s wrong?” Enlil was at a loss.

        “Sigh. That should be my line. You were screaming. I thought something bad happened to you.” Marduk the male Eldus shook his head with his arms crossed.

        “Screaming...Oh...Right. I think I had a horrifying nightmare...but I can’t remember it...Ouch!”

        As Enlil felt a sharp pain in her head, Marduk massaged her temple to ease the pain. 

        “Thank you, Marduk,” Enlil said with a sweet smile.

        “You must have exhausted yourself for the research. Just ignore Shamash’s urge and take care of yourself first.”

        “Hehe, Marduk is caring as always. Don’t worry. I’m strong. I won’t go down so easily.” Enlil made fun of herself by flexing her thin arm, but somehow she was anxious.

        “Ever since the arrival, I’ve been dreaming of those scenes...They’re like past memories that actually happened but not unreal…”

        Enlil kept everything to herself in order not to make the others worry, but the dreams were getting more and more frequent. The being’s resentment towards Eldus was gradually imprinted in Enlil’s consciousness. Therefore, she couldn’t help but incite Astrid’s hatred towards the Eldus when she discovered Astrid’s eavesdropping on her conversation with Shamash. 

        “Why did I do such a thing...What is…wrong with me...Who...am I?”

        Enlil’s mind began to break down as she couldn’t differentiate reality and dreams. She couldn’t separate her mind from the being in her dream.

        One day, she took action. When Marduk was trying to stop Shamash from invading the Mech City, the alter ego took over her body. She asked Marduk out and murdered him with her own hands.

        “It’s just one step away from liberating our origin and killing those Eldus. How can I let you get in the way!”

        The pure and innocent face of Enlil became terrifying because of the resentment, and Marduk died in a shock. 

        Enlil regained her consciousness at the moment Marduk stopped breathing, leaving her trembling at the scene hopelessly. Meanwhile, it started raining. The downpour washed the bloodstains away, but not the despair in her heart.

        “This is...N-No...Can someone...save me…” Shivering, Enlil wept painfully in the rain.

        Later on, her redemption appeared——Xada the alien.

        When Enlil held the hands of that alien, the sense of the familiar power filled the long-lost part in her. As her soul was connected to the embryo parasitizing on the heart, the past memory began to play in Enlil’s head——

        Weak footsteps alerted it when it was resting after Manungal’s torture. Looking over, it was a pink-haired little girl, who appeared to be trespassing accidentally.

        “Do you wanna see something interesting?” it said.

        “Who’s talking?”

        “It’s me, inside the container at the end of this room.”

        Driven by curiosity, the little girl bounced her way over. She was bold, for she wasn’t intimidated by its unorthodox appearance. Instead, she scanned it.

        “What interesting thing?”

        “Just something interesting.”

        It pressed its palm against the transparent barrier.

        “You’ll see it when you put your palm here too.”

        “Hmm...” After a while of thinking, the girl nodded. 

        “Alright. You’ll be punished if it’s not interesting!”

        Tipping her toes, the girl pressed her palm onto the transparent barrier. A palm size embryo then drilled into her body from its palm. At that moment, the girl Enlil was dead. The one who lived inside this body was North——a demon born from the origin of destruction.

        However, to hide itself from the Eldus, North destroyed the linkage between its memories and its body, so that it could live as Enlil the Eldus. Still, its ultimate goal was never forgotten——wipe the Eldus clan out by awakening the origin that had conceived it. 

        “I remember…”

        A relieving smile appeared on Enlil’s face, as if she was liberated from the everlasting nightmare.

        With her eyes closed, Enlil raised her arm to call the body and the sealed power of destruction at the other side of the galaxy. As the repelling force had been sealed by Pompeii the machina, the darkness managed to break free from the container and travel all the way to Enlil.

        “This is...the clone of the essence,” Xada exclaimed. 

        “Yes. This is the power of the origin. It was attached when I was born, and now it finally returned to me. With this, we’ll be able to break that damned barrier and awaken the origin of destruction.”

        Holding the darkness, Enlil whispered in indulgence, “then kill all Eldus. Wipe their existence out. Only this can bring peace to Laplace...”
