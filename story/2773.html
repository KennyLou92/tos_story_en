        <h1>Bee-autiful Empress - Marguerite</h1>
        <p>
                That day, Marguerite went to the Orient alone, where Ibarakidouji—her love—was after she had passed the crown and the great responsibility as the Queen Bee. She hugged him tightly at the moment of union, believing that they would stick together for the rest of their lives. Yet, little did she expect that there would be changes between them.

        After Shuten-dōji had unified the Orient, he left all the administrative work to Ibarakidouji. Ever since then, the workload of Ibarakidouji increased drastically and drove him to constant exhaustion, which made Marguerite’s heartache.

        One night, Marguerite draped a blanket over Ibarakidouji, who fell asleep at his desk surrounded by piles of scrolls, only to awaken him accidentally.

        ‘Go to your bed and sleep, okay?’ said Marguerite tenderly as she saw Ibarakidouji come awake. 

        ‘No, I can’t rest now. I can’t leave the work undone.’

        ‘Then give me some work. As the former Queen Bee, I’m good at handling administrative work.’

        ‘No! You came here to be happy. Don’t ever bring this up again!’ growled Ibarakidouji, whose voice was deeper than usual because of weariness.

        His voice at that moment was nothing familiar to Marguerite. It was not until then that she recalled that she had not seen a smile on Ibarakidouji’s face for a long time. She knew that Ibarakidouji wanted her to live a happy and carefree life, but seeing him turning down her help and bearing the burdens all by himself… just upset her.

        Marguerite wanted to relieve Ibarakidouji’s burden; but more than that, she wanted him to know that she was not a rose that needed great care. However, the more often she brought it up to Ibarakidouji, the more often he avoided her.

        Snowed under with work, Ibarakidouji eventually got attacked by other youkais, who caught him unguarded in a tour of inspection one day. He was trapped in a valley for his serious injury.

        When one of his subordinates strenuously broke through the siege and went back to the mansion with the news, all the youkais in the mansion got into sheer panic. Just then, Marguerite decided to take the wheel.

        ‘How can you still call yourself as the subordinates of Ibarakidouji like this?!’ shouted Marguerite, showing a natural majesty as a ruler, which stunned everyone in the room into silence.

        Promptly, Marguerite delegated tasks to every worker, who found that not only did Marguerite remember each of their names and specialties, but also give them jobs that suited them. At her command, the youkais rescued the trapped Ibarakidouji successfully; even better, they defeated the enemies.

        Looking at Marguerite, who stood in an imposing yet easy manner, Ibarakidouji could not help but show a wry smile.

        ‘My dear, I was wrong.’

        ‘What were you wrong about?’

        ‘I shouldn’t have taken up everything alone and left my wife alone.’

        Seeing that Ibarakidouji finally got what she meant, Marguerite gave her a gentle smile. Standing by each other, together they ruled the whole Orient…</p>
