        <h1>Perpetual Metta - Lakshmi</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Hindu Gods - Ch.6

        For the first few days after being saved by Vishnu from the palace of Sinha, Lakshmi struggled to escape from the haunting nightmares of her past. Pessimistic and sensitive, she wallowed in fear and doubts despite being under Vishnu’s protection and even thought that Vishnu would abandon her.

        Fortunately, with Vishnu’s unwavering support, she gradually overcame her traumatic past. With her newfound confidence, she started venturing outdoors and helping Vishnu gather firewood or pick mushrooms.

        One day, Lakshmi heard an unusual noise when she headed to the outskirts as usual.

        ‘The sound… Someone is hurt… I must go and see!’ Lakshmi followed the sound and arrived at a large boulder, behind which she discovered a peculiar figure.

        It was a man and a woman, their bodies grotesquely fused together—they were conjoined twins. However, the male twin appeared to have perished for some time, his head slumped, motionless. The woman, on the other hand, was covered in wounds with a fist-sized wound in her abdomen, heavily bleeding. She seemed to have slipped into a stupor because of excessive bleeding.

        ‘She’s severely injured; she won’t survive if she doesn’t receive proper treatment immediately!’ Although Lakshmi was initially shocked by the twins’ appearance, she swiftly gathered herself and took out some preventive ointment to tend to the woman’s wounds.

        “No… Run… He’s… He’s coming…” The woman, barely able to speak, pleaded as Lakshmi approached.

        However, Lakshmi shook her head, refusing to heed her words. “No, you’ll die if I walk away.” Despite the imminent danger, Lakshmi insisted on helping the woman and forfeited her chance to escape.

        “I’ve found you, Nandi the guinea pig,” a childish voice sounded.

        Lakshmi turned around only to see a young boy with an elephant trunk, standing with a blood-stained blade in his hand; he was clearly the culprit behind Nandi’s injuries.

        ‘He is… I know him. He is Ganesha, the adopted son of the renowned physician, Brahma, who serves the King, Varuna. So, does that mean Brahma wants to kill her?’

        Lakshmi was gripped by fear, her mind filled with thoughts of escape. However, she felt a surge of courage when she thought of leaving Nandi at the mercy of her assailant. Suppressing her fear, she stood in front of Nandi and boldly demanded answers, “Why are you trying to kill her?”

        “She tried to ruin Father’s plan, so Father asked me to kill her,” Ganesha bluntly stated his purpose.

        “No, that’s not right. Every life is incredibly precious and should not be taken lightly,” Lakshmi firmly said with such fearlessness and resolve that she wavered Ganesha for a second. Yet, that second of hesitation was quickly overpowered by his devotion to protecting his father, Brahma.

        “Father’s orders are absolute! So stay out of my way, or I’ll kill you too!”

        “Ru… Run…” Nandi weakly lifted her eyes and pushed Lakshmi with her hand, but her push turned into a feeble nudge because of her injuries.

        Lakshmi looked at the frail and powerless Nandi, who mirrored her past helpless self. A wave of compassion and sympathy swept through her, prompting her to confront Ganesha despite knowing the limitations of her power.

        “No, I’m not leaving. I won’t let you kill her.”

        “Alright then, don’t blame me for this!” With flaring murderous intent, Ganesha raised his weapon and charged at Lakshmi—

        Boom!

        A robust figure suddenly appeared in mid-air, parrying Ganesha’s attack with a swift counterstrike and sending him flying into a distance. The impact knocked him unconscious and he crashed to the ground.

        “Vishnu!” Lakshmi exclaimed with delight as she recognized the figure.

        Vishnu hurriedly walked toward Lakshmi. Holding her hands, he nervously assessed her up and down, and asked, “Lakshmi, are you alright?”

        “I… I’m fine, thanks to you arriving just in time, ” Lakshmi replied, a scarlet blush rising to her cheeks as she looked at their intertwined fingers.

        It was then that Vishnu realized his action was too intimate. He quickly released Laskhmi’s hands and gave a slight apologetic cough. He then turned his gaze toward Ganesha, who was lying on the ground. With a puzzled frown, he asked, “Isn't he Brahma’s adopted child? Why was he trying to kill you?”

        “He… He is here to kill me, not her,” Nandi, who had slightly recovered thanks to Lakshmi’s treatment, spoke up.

        “Who are you exactly? And why would Brahma want you dead?” Vishnu inquired.

        “I… I’m Nandi, and he… he was my twin brother, Bhairava. Our parents abandoned us because of our deformities. Luckily, we met someone who was kind enough to take us in,” Nandi revealed her story. “However, my health somehow began to deteriorate, so my brother sought out a renowned physician, Brahma, for a cure. Little did we know that he would imprison us and put us through horrible experiments, and that cost my brother’s life…”

        When Nandi talked about her brother, she could not help but burst into tears because of grief. It took a moment for her to compose herself and continue, “After my escape from the experiment, all I wanted was to seek revenge for my brother. So, I secretly followed Brahma. I arrived in a forest where I saw him preparing for a dreadful ritual. He was mumbling about destroying everything for the world’s rebirth. I tried to walk closer so that I could hear better, but he found me and sent that boy to hunt me down. I was injured during my escape, and you know the rest…”

        “Darn it… What is Brahma trying to do?!” Vishnu rumbled in anger, clenching his hands into fists. Meanwhile, Lakshmi, deep in thought, looked up at the two blazes of scarlet light hanging high in the sky. Hesitantly, she said, “Just a thought… Could he be trying to amplify the destructive power of the blaze and use it to destroy the world?”

        “...You’re right! That must be it!” It was the moment of epiphany for Vishnu. “He is out of his mind! I have to stop him!”

        “But it’s too dangerous. Perhaps we should call for help—”

        “No, that’ll take too long.” Vishnu hesitated for a moment, but ultimately he succumbed to his heart and stepped forward to give Lakshmi a hug as he whispered in her ear, “Stay here and wait for my return.”

        “...Okay. Please come back safely,” Lakshmi replied, returning Vishnu’s embrace affectionately.

        “Take this. In case something happens, take this back to our residence and my disciples will help you,” Vishnu said, handing a pendant to Lakshmi. She carefully put it in her pocket as if it were some kind of treasure. It was after a tender moment that they reluctantly parted ways.

        After asking Nandi about Brahma’s whereabouts, Vishnu turned and left, striding off with determined steps. However, Lakshmi’s heart skipped a beat as she watched his figure recede into the distance as if she was about to lose something precious.

        In a cruel twist of fate, her premonition proved true.

        The two blazes of scarlet light in the sky exhibited an abnormality: the left one began to grow and gradually engulfed the right one. The land was shrouded by a foreboding gloom with an eerie silence permeating the air.

        ‘The destructive blaze has grown stronger… Something must have happened to Vishnu!’ The dreadful thought compelled Lakshmi to chase after Vishnu disregarding the impending danger. Strangely, there was not a single trace of animals or beasts along the way, as if they had been erased by some invisible force. Ominous as it was, it allowed Lakshmi to find the location of Brahma’s ritual unimpeded.

        As soon as she entered, she saw Vishnu lying on the ground, barely clinging to life. His body was entangled with shadows, and his once flawlessly tanned skin was now covered in terrifying cracks.

        “Vishnu!” Lakshmi rushed to his side. His body was icy cold, like a lifeless corpse. Tears brimmed over her eyes as she was plunged into a state of panic.

        ‘What should I do? I have to do something or the shadows will eventually consume and destroy Vishnu!’ Suddenly, Lakshmi noticed the shadows within Vishnu flowing toward her hands. She was initially stunned by the spectacle, but a cheerful smile soon spread across her face.

        “Oh right, I can absorb these shadows. Vishnu doesn’t have to die!” Lakshmi lowered herself, pressing her body tightly against Vishnu’s while shouting in her mind, ‘Come, ominous shadows, come to me.’

        Drawn to Lakshmi’s beckoning, the shadows began to flow toward Lakshmi’s body, bringing her the pain she had been familiar with. Yet, this time was different—she was not forced to take in the pain; instead, she welcomed the agony as she willingly embraced her power to protect the love of her life.

        Lakshmi gazed at Vishnu, whose eyes were closed, with devout love. At that moment, she forgot all her sorrows and immersed herself in the ocean of love.

        ‘I understand it now. My power is meant for this very moment, to purify your immaculate heart, to protect my true love, as written in the rules of nature.’

        ‘Vishnu, thank you. Even though our days together were short-lived, they were still the happiest and most fulfilling days of my life. I have no regrets, and I am grateful to have been born into this world filled with struggles because it led me to you.’

        ‘You are the cleanest, the most just and compassionate man in the world; you are never meant to be clouded by shadows, and I am so grateful that I can take on this suffering in your place.’

        A scorching tear rolled down the corner of Lakshmi’s eye. In the next moment, her body began to crack from her limbs and eventually turned into ashes that scattered into the air. Only the pendant Vishnu had given her remained behind...</p>
