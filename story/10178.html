        <h1>Kotarou Katsura</h1>
        <p>
        A Jyoui-shishi wanted by the Bakufu, known as “The Rampaging Noble”.

He is a childhood friend of Gintoki and also a comrade in the Joui War. He is given the nickname “Zura” (wig). 

Perhaps it is his overly serious personality, he sometimes takes unexpected and bold actions.

He is also known as “Runaway Kotarou” for his rapid retreats and expertise in disguise.

He is often seen working hard on side jobs, such as being a barker, to earn funds for Joui activities.</p>
