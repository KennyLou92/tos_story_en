        <h1>Miracle Coronation - Cornflower</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.3

        On the day of the Century Feast, the rebel army stormed the banquet hall. Fortunately, Cornflower and Nepenthes arrived just in time to save Hyacinth. However, Papaver, the leader of the rebellion, had disappeared from the hall by then, so Nepenthes captured one of the rebels and interrogated him only to learn that she had headed to Blossomville with the rest of the rebel fighters.

        ‘She must be aiming for the Mother Tree! We can’t let her get what she wants! Nepenthes, you stay here and deal with the rebels while I take the troop to Blossomville!’ Cornflower led his troop to Blossomville as soon as he delegated duties to Nepenthes. Still, he was one step too late.

        When he stepped into Blossomville, Papaver was pulling a dagger out of Mysorensis’ body. With sap gushing from her wound, Mysorensis powerlessly fell into the ocean of flowers. Petals flew everywhere, some landing near Papaver’s feet.

        ‘Madam Mysorensis!’ Cornflower shouted.

        ‘He is… Cornflower the third prince… Great… He came just at the right time…’ As Papaver looked at Cornflower and his troop, a murderous smile appeared on her face. She ruthlessly trampled down the petals that were soaked in Mysorensis’ sap as though to release the madness hidden in her heart, foreshadowing what she was going to do next.

        ‘Everyone! Now it’s the time to eradicate those atrocious elves in the enchantment who have oppressed us! Let the Mother Tree be ours!’ shouted Papaver, who pointed her weapon at Cornflower. Her call heightened the rebel army’s blood lust, urging them to raise their weapons and charge at the imperial army after responding to their leader with a roar in unison.

        ‘Soldiers! At my order, capture all the rebels and kill whoever resists you!’ Corflower’s face darkened in an instant. As he raised his sword and gave the order, all the imperial soldiers unsheathed their weapons to repel the rebels.

        While the soldiers contained the rebellion, Cornflower ran straight to the Mother Tree, where Papaver was. Knowing that the female floral-elf was the rebels’ leader, he decisively drew his sword and thrust at her without mercy.

        Unexpectedly, Papaver took out a thorny whip from her waist as if she had anticipated what Cornflower would do. With a spin of her wrist, the whip caught the prince’s sword and restrained his movements.

        ‘Humph! It seems you’re nothing more than that!’ Papaver gave a cold snort. Then she pulled her whip trying to disarm Cornflower by taking away his sword. However, she failed to do so because of some force, so she took a closer look only to find that there was a thin layer of ice on her whip causing it to stick firmly to the sword.

        ‘You should be talking about yourself!’ Cornflower channeled his power to freeze Papaver’s entire whip with a sudden burst of cold gas. Then, crack! The whip shattered into pieces as he forcefully moved his hand.

        As soon as Cornflower broke the whip, he continued his attack with a nimble spin. Even though Papaver managed to protect her vitals, she still got stabbed in the right shoulder, and her sap began to spurt.

        Just when Cornflower was going to make another attack, he felt an ominous vibration from his right. His body took a step back by reflex but he still failed to dodge the attack. A gash as long as a palm was made on his right leg and he started bleeding. What was worse was that his skin around the wound began to turn dark purple and it was spreading over his body.

        ‘It’s… poison… You put poison on your dagger!’ Cornflower cried out in pain as he felt tingles in his wound.

        ‘That’s right.’ Papaver raised her left hand in which was her weapon—a dagger tipped with poison. She then continued, ‘I didn’t expect the prince to be such a skillful fighter. You left me no choice but to use my secret weapon. Just so you know, the poison on this dagger is rare to find. It only takes a few drops to paralyze an elf.’

        ‘You… Argh…’ The tingles had spread over Cornflower’s entire right leg over their short conversation. Losing the ability to stand, he could only support his body with his long sword.

        Papaver slowly leaned toward Cornflower and said with a cold laugh, ‘No one can stop me from getting back what belongs to me!’

        After leaving those words, Papaver held her dagger up high and thrust it straight at Cornflower.

        “No! I can’t die yet! I have to protect this kingdom and the Mother Tree!”

        Cornflower rolled over the ground in desperation to dodge Papaver’s attack. He then scraped the entire wound as well as the infected flesh using his sword. His right leg regained a little sensation as his sap spurted out along with the poison.

        ‘Now die!’ Gritting his teeth, Cornflower endured the agonizing pain in his wound and leaped to make a lunge at Papaver, who was defenseless against his unexpected attack, and naturally, his sword pierced through her heart.

        ‘Argh…’ Letting out a scream of pain, the seriously wounded Papaver fell under the Mother Tree. Petals fell from the sky like a flurry of snow with sunlight dappling her face through the branches. All the flowers and sunlight should have belonged to her but they had been stripped away from her because of some ridiculous reasons. That was why she decided to take back everything that she deserved, but she eventually failed.

        “Why?”

        “I was only a step away from the Mother Tree. I could have bathed in the light of the Mother Tree, and retained my pride and my parents’ dignity… ”

        “How unreasonable… Why… Why does the Mother Tree belong to those hideous elves?!”

“Since I can’t get the Mother Tree, then no one can have her!”

        Papaver mustered the power in her body and summoned an eerie purple flame with overflowing despair and hatred as her fuel, setting her flesh and soul on fire. The fire of madness climbed up the Mother Tree and ignited all her leaves, stems and branches.

        Seeing the Mother Tree in danger, Cornflower anxiously walked to her. Yet, his paralyzed legs dragged him down to the ground.

        Even though the concentration of the poison had been temporarily reduced when Cornflower removed the infected tissue, it did not stop it from flowing through his body. The tingling sensation slowly spread from his leg to his upper body. He could feel that his heart was slowing down. Even so, his mind was still fixated on the burning Mother Tree.

        “The Mother Tree… We have to… put out the fire immediately…” Cornflower reached out his hand. However, the poison has spread to his head, blurring his sight. There was only one thought left in his fading consciousness: “May Lily… Quick… Mmm''

        Unfortunately, Cornflower was already at the end of his strength. He fell into a coma before May Lily came, leaving the helpless imperial troop in a panic alone with the rebel fighters whose spirit had been dampened by the loss of their leader…
