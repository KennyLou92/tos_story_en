        <h1>Lord of All Gods - Khaos</h1>
        <p>
                You have learned the gods’ scheme from Yog-Sothoth and the illusion created by her. Anxiousness, uncertainty, and anger all stir inside you; fatigue has numbed your senses, but you press on. You know what it takes to save the realm and everyone in it. The realm of gods is right before you. You stare at your destination. You hear millions of god soldiers’ voices crying out in rage ahead, but they shall not impede your resolution to save the world.

        Faced with countless enemies, you feel yourself energized with reignited belligerence. You calmly gather mana to summon your comrades — the heroic spirits. Dazzling lights of five colors that represent the druids of the five elements brighten the passage. The Light Druid and the Fire Druid share their stored elemental power with you and the other druids. You feel a gust of warmth flowing through your veins reinvigorating you. The enemies are initiating their first wave of attacks, but you feel fearless because you are not fighting alone…

        After defeating the enemies, you get on an elevator leading to the realm of gods. The doors open, and you see Khaos, the Protogenoi and the cause of the disaster, sitting on the throne shrouded in chaotic energy. 

        ”To think a human can be this capable...They have failed to stop you...But we’re only a few steps away from creating a world of idealism. I won’t let you destroy our great work!”

        Khaos’s voice resounds through the hall. Suddenly, a deterring chaotic power floods into you! The energy the druids have granted you vanishes in a blink. The warm flow inside you is replaced by a chill. The druids hold you as you slump to the ground. You smile at them. You know you will not fall before the end.

        Khaos stands up and treads towards you. At the same time, you and the druids charge at him without fear. All of you gather mana and elemental power to launch continuous attacks at Khaos, but his chaotic power merely absorbs all of them. Countless dark elemental spheres emerge in the air as he clutches his fists. Then he points his finger downwards, and all of the spheres shower at you! Your shield nullifies some of the spheres but shatters as Khaos’s strength proves too overwhelming…

        Surrender, human! Feel your insignificance!”

        Khaos’s taunts only make you more determined. You struggle to stand up on your trembling legs. It is the moment of life and death. You know victory is your only option. At your command, the Earth Druid ejects a flow of Earth elemental power to obstruct Khaos, while the Water Druid connects all five elements to your mana circulation. All of you pour every ounce of energy into the Dark Druid, and the energy sphere in her hands becomes bigger and bigger!

        “We must push forward and complete our mission to save everyone in the realm!”

        Immediately, you and the Dark druid launch your greatest blows at Khaos! A pillar of light pierces the sky and vanishes. An eerie silence descends over the hall…</p>
