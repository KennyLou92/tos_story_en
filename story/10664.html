                [b][i]Battlecruiser Project - Log Entry Day 1693

        How did things end up like this?

        It’s all my fault. If only I had been more tentative during the inspections, the accident could have been prevented, and none of those tragedies would have happened…

        Regardless, the guilt lies with me, not with those innocent newborn lives. To me and my fellow researchers, they are not mere lifeless tools but vividly thriving sentient beings. I will not let anyone extinguish them!

        Lead Researcher
        Gamma[/i][/b]

        Late at night, in the Oroz Management Center’s basement, a female machina hurriedly paced through the dimly lit corridor, her brisk footsteps breaking the silence. She quickly arrived at the massive mechanical door at the end of the corridor and eagerly leaned toward the face recognition device beside it before she steadied herself.

        Beep—

        “Identity verified. Gamma the golden scientist, the lead researcher of the Battlecruiser Project. Access to the laboratory, granted,” a robotic voice declared unemotionally as the door slid open.

        ‘Thank goodness. They haven’t had the chance to alter my permissions yet,’ Gamma, the female machina, thought to herself. As she strode into the laboratory, she could not help but marvel once again at the wondrous sight within the lab despite the urgent situation.

        Inside the spacious lab were numerous maturation tanks, each filled with a pile of fragments of kinetic cores that belonged to different deceased machinas. These fragments were obtained with the consent of the machinas, carefully extracted from their bodies after their passing.

        Gamma and her fellow researchers gathered the fragments and utilized remnants of the machinas’ life essences trapped within. After numerous failed attempts, they managed to nurture a new consciousness through a meticulous refinement process—an extraordinary sentient being that was capable of controlling a large number of metallic components.

        Atop each pile of the kinetic cores was a glowing metallic seed, the fruit of their experiment. The seeds were meant to be nurtured patiently until they blossomed. Then, they would be transplanted into the finished battlecruisers, where they would become the central cores.

        Unfortunately, a tragic accident occurred. During the maiden flight, one of the researchers mistakenly transplanted a mutated seed into a battlecruiser which went on a rampage alongside their Guide, resulting in extensive casualties, and it took tremendous effort to bring the rogue battlecruiser under control.

        The Heptara Unies and various organizations reassessed the safety of the project, deeming the battlecruisers too dangerous, so they decided to terminate the project and issued orders to destroy all the finished vessels.

        As the lead researcher of the project, Gamma could not bear to see the fruits of her experiment being obliterated. So, upon receiving the news, she immediately rushed to the laboratory overnight to liberate those newborn lives ahead of the execution.

        ‘Stay focused! I have to set them free as soon as possible before they catch me.’ After Gamma gathered herself, she stepped into the depths of the laboratory where, unexpectedly, she found a figure standing before the control panel.

        “I knew you would come, Gamma,” said the figure, revealing his identity as he turned around—it was Kepler, a stern-looking male machina dressed in a uniform that represented his position as a special agent of the Oroz Management Center.

        “Kepler…” Gamma looked at her childhood friend and asked in a deep tone, “Are you here to stop me?”

        “Yes, I can’t watch my best friend make a mistake and become a criminal,” Kepler raised his gun, pointing it directly at Gamma. “Stop now, while you still have a chance.”

        “A mistake?” Gamma chuckled softly. “They are being unjustly sentenced to destruction when they have done nothing wrong! Do you think that’s the right decision?”

        “Perhaps it’s not the most righteous solution, but it’s the best way to alleviate the pain of the victims and their families,” Kepler replied firmly.

        “No, I disagree. I don’t think this is the best solution!” shouted Gammer, drawing her weapon and aiming it at Kepler, “Kepler, if you insist on stopping me, then I have no choice but to defeat you!”

        “Is that so? Let’s see how it plays out then!” Kepler initiated the attack, raising his silver gun to unleash a rapid barrage of shots toward Gamma. Yet, Gamma, prepared for the attack, blocked each shot skillfully with her weapon. Seizing the opportunity, she concentrated her mind, conjured multiple blades with the power of elements, and launched them toward Kepler.

        “You can’t defeat me with such frail attacks!” Kepler calmly responded, squinting his eyes as he fired back at the blades of elements that were shattered into fragments mid-air. His assault went on—he fired another bullet, but this time, he aimed a corner of the ceiling instead of directly at  Gamma.

        Seemingly, it was an inaccurate shot, but the bullet miraculously ricocheted, taking an incredibly precise trajectory that aimed at Gamma’s arm—

        “Argh!” Gamma cried out in pain, collapsing to the ground, motionless.

        “Gamma!” Kepler, who thought he had struck a critical blow, rushed to Gamma’s side to check on her, only to feel an intense force targeting his kinetic core. To his surprise, Gamma, who was supposed to be unconscious, opened her eyes and attacked him mercilessly.

        “Kepler, you’re still as kind as ever,” Gamma said, mustering a bitter smile.

        “No… Gamma… You can’t… Mm…” Although Kepler tried to dissuade Gamma, the impact overwhelmed his will. He could only slump to the ground and succumbed to unconsciousness.

        After tending to Kepler, Gamma walked to the control panel and swiftly transferred all the metallic seeds inside the maturation tanks, along with the piles of kinetic cores, to their designated battlecruisers. Then, she awakened the Guides for each vessel, taking the final step.

        Swish—

        The gateway to the universe opened. Despite the force of weightlessness, all the battlecruisers maintained their resolute course, marching forward with unwavering determination toward the realm of freedom.

        ‘My children, you are about to embark on a long journey full of unknown. You will grow by absorbing various nutrients. No matter what happens, please don’t forget kindness and reason. Only through continued perseverance can you radiate the brightest light of life.’ Gamma watched as the battlecruisers departed. “May your journey be filled with hope and light.”

        After the last battlecruiser successfully departed, the sound of hurried footsteps approached the laboratory from afar. In a moment, a female machina accompanied by dozens of armed agents surrounded the laboratory’s entrance, cutting off any escape route for Gamma.

        “Gamma the golden scientist, as the lead researcher of the Battlecruiser project, you have violated researcher protocols by clandestinely liberating fugitives and assaulting one of the Oroz Management Center agents, Kepler. I, Laura Bass, also a special agent of the Oroz Management  Center, hereby announce that you’re under arrest!” Laura raised her weapon, pointing it at Gamma. “Put down your weapon and surrender, or we will apprehend you with force.”

        “No need for the trouble,” said Gamma, who dropped her weapon, putting her hands in the air with a smile of relief. “I plead guilty. I’ll go with you.”

        And so, Gamma, the once renowned researcher, became an infamous criminal overnight, confined to the depths of a space prison, where daylight could never reach...</p>
