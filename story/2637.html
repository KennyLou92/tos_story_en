        <h1>Philyra, The Authors' Muse</h1>
        <p>
        Considering humans a talented race with unlimited potential, Philyra imparted her knowledge to them over generations.
Back then, humans could only record their stories by carving on stone, taking much precious time and effort. 

“Is there any other way to record things?” Philyra asked. 

“My lady, the art of stone-carving has been passed down by our great ancestors. Is it a problem?” a follower replied. 

“Isn’t it quite inconvenient?” asked Philyra. 

The followers, most of them poets and writers, nodded in agreement. 

At that moment, inspiration struck Philyra. She got the skin of a lamb, dried it, then proceeded to write on it with charcoal. From then on, human civilization experienced a huge leap and people worshipped Philyra every time they wrote on or made paper. </p>
