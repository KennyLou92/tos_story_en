        <h1>Destructive Obsession - Rosemellow</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.5

        On the day of the Century Feast, Rosemellow conspired with Papaver to sneak the rebel army into the palace and drugged the first princess, Strelitzia. Just when Rosemellow thought she could have Strelitzia all to her own, May Lily came with a troop and captured her but he soon left alone after hearing that Cornflower was in danger.

        Rosemellow was forced to stay in a corner along with the other rebels with her hands tied behind her back. Then, she looked at the sleeping Strelitzia, whose beauty had not been diminished by her disheveled hair caused by the commotion. The sight of the princess tickled Rosemellow’s heart and fueled her burning desire.

        “I’m only a step away from having you to my own. I won’t let those people ruin my plan!”

        However, Rosemellow became anxious when two soldiers were going to carry Strelitzia back to the palace. She hurriedly mustered her power to break free only to find that there were thorns on the vine that bound her hands; the more she tried, the deeper the thorns sank into her skin. She began to bleed and her sap even trickled down her fingertips.

        She had no choice but to chase after the soldiers who were carrying Strelitzia when the guard turned around. However, the other soldier caught her left arm when she was about to catch up. Letting out a groan of pain, Rosemellow looked at Strelitzia, who unexpectedly woke up from the coma and glanced toward her in a daze.

        ‘Nothing can stop me from getting Strelitzia!’ Steeling herself, Rosemellow kicked her leg hard which caused her left arm to bend in an unnatural angle in the soldier’s hand. The sound of stem snapping made the soldier freeze for a moment.

        The thorny shackles slipped from Rosemellow’s hand and fell to the ground along with her broken arm. Her sap smeared across the floor and released a strange floral fragrance. Despite losing an arm, Rosemellow snatched a sword that hung on the soldier’s waist and knocked down the other one who was carrying Strelitzia. Then she dragged the princess into the nearest small room.

        Rosemellow locked the door and barricaded it with multiple objects so that the soldiers could not break in for a while. Although Strelitzia remained in a state of confusion at first, she gradually woke up as Rosemellow’s warm sap ran down from the wound and fell on her skin. Her vision cleared and she saw the seriously wounded Rosemellow gazing at her zealously.

        Rosemellow flashed her a blissfully sweet smile. With her eyes shrouded in mist as if she was reveling in an intoxicating dream, she said fondly, ‘Here, there’s still time. Let’s escape from the window at the back and go back to the home that belongs to the only two of us.’

        ‘What is going on? You- Where is Papaver? I thought we were—’

        ‘Why do your eyes only see other elves? I’m hurt… Why wouldn’t you take a look at me? I want to be with you forever… I will do anything as long as I can have you, hehe.’ Rosemellow’s face which was splattered by sap contorted with obsession and desire swirling in her eyes.

        Yet, that did not frighten Strelitzia. She propped up her body and glared fiercely at Rosemellow, questioning, ‘What did you do to Papaver? Tell me!’

        Giving Strelitzia a distorted smile in pain, Rosemellow told her about Papaver’s betrayal. Her voice faltered while she threatened the princess, ‘Look what you’ve done to the kingdom, princess. You’ve lost your place so just come and flee with me.’

        ‘No, you’re lying! Papaver would never do that! She is so fine and innocent! You’re slandering her!’ In denial, Strelitzia grabbed Rosemellow, who forcibly pulled her hand away and said, ‘I colluded with those filthy floral-elves and I got rid of Sakura. I did everything for you but you never laid your eyes on me!’

        ‘What… So it was you who hurt Sakura?’ Strelitzia’s face darkened in an instant.

        Rosemellow uncontrollably exploded with a nervous laughter in a panic after the truth slipped off her tongue. She then wore a cold expression and said in a soft tone, ‘Don’t worry. The assassin will soon take her back to the Mother Tree’s embrace so she won’t have your attention anymore, and then I will finally be the only elf in your eyes. No elves can stop us after today!’

        ‘You— You’re crazy! I should kill you!’ An irrepressible rage erupted inside Strelitzia’s chest like a volcano and boiled her blood. She took a random sharp weapon and made a slash at Rosemellow, who dodged her attack by moving sideways. Throwing her only arm around the princess’ shoulders, Rosemellow said, ‘I’m the elf who has done the most for you, but why can’t you just love me back?!’

        ‘I will never love you even if you’re the last elf in the world!’ Strelitzia shoved Rosemellow away, pushing her to the window. As Rosemellow looked back, the height outside struck her with fear. She then turned around but her vision had become blurred due to the excessive loss of sap. By the time her eyes could finally focus, Strelitzia had already stabbed her with the weapon!

        The hatred and disgust in Strelitzia’s eyes as well as her words stabbed Rosemellow’s heart like pieces of broken glass. It hurt her a thousand times more than the wounds on her body. Sucked into a vortex of despair and heartbreak, she had a sudden thought, “Even after everything I have done for you, you still treat me like nothing… Since I can’t have you in my life, then we shall die together.”

        In a fleeting second, Rosemellow turned around and held Strelitzia against the window. Just when the two of them were going to fall out of the window, someone burst open the door—it was Rose with several soldiers behind her.

        ‘Get out of my way!’ Grabbing Strelitzia, Rosemellow jumped out of the window and said with a smile, ‘Now we can be together forever.’

        However, a few vines flew over and caught Strelitzia’s hand just in time but they failed to save Rosemellow, who involuntarily loosened her grip because of the sudden reaction force.

        ‘Rosemellow—!’ Under Strelitzia’s gaze, Rosemellow fell alone. Her dress fluttered in the wind and accentuated her exquisite body as well as the gaping hole in her left shoulder. The sweet smile on her face looked so exceptionally bewitching that it was forever burned into Strelitzia’s memory.

        “In the end, you finally lay your eyes on me, hehe.”</p>
