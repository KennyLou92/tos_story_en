        <p>
                “Though our married life may have lasted for just one night, I shall take care of you for the rest of my life.  If any accidents befall you, how can I...countinue on?” 

        In the past, Li Hsiao-Yao was tricked into taking the Sorrow-forgetting Powder, losing the memories of his wife, Ling-Er.  During his amnesia, Lin Yue-Ru had always devoted herself to him.  Later on, although he had regained his memories, misfortunes still stroke them as Ling-Er fell into a coma due to  over-exertion while Yue-Ru was fatally wounded, her life barely maintained by goddess guardian’s pneuma.  Li Hsiao-Yao journeyed all over in search of a panacea, and his carefree nature from behind was now long gone.  Only when summoning the Deity of Alcohol did his past heroism return, destroying Yaoguais in fiery enthusiasm.</p>
