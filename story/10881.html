        <h1>Orgiastic Waltzes - Liszt</h1>
        <p>        ‘The brilliance of a genius should never be buried—it must shine in all its glory.’

        This thought came into Liszt’s mind as he looked around the Melodists seated around him—or perhaps this idea had long taken root in his mind since the day he became a Melodist of the Nocturne Orchestra, quietly growing into an inescapable yearning that constantly tickled him.

        ‘It’s the Maestro Bach.’ From the corner of his eye, Liszt caught sight of an austere middle-aged man—Bach, the principal conductor of the Court of Music. He silently brushed his fingers against the musical sigil on his body to summon his musical instrument.

        ‘Or perhaps today is the perfect opportunity for the genius to finally be recognized.’

        Like a butterfly breaking free from its cocoon, the restless yearning became an unstoppable force as the opportunity came. Ignoring the rehearsed dynamics, Liszt chose to play his section in his own flamboyant style, adding a cascade of virtuosic techniques to showcase his talent. At the same time, he remained mindful of the overall harmony and elevated the performance to an even higher level with his improv.

        When the performance ended, all Melodists erupted into applause for Liszt, their compliments filling him with a glow of pride. So, when Bach summoned him, he could not help but tremble with excitement as he walked over, certain he was about to receive praise. However, the reality was far from what he expected.

        “Liszt,” Bach said in a low voice, “You are stripped of your role as a Melodist. I’m reassigning you to the workshop and you shall work as an instrument maker starting today.”

        “WHAT? WHY?”  Bach’s words utterly shocked Liszt. His disbelief quickly gave way to a tidal wave of rage that washed away all his sense of decorum. He raised his voice and demanded, “Was there something wrong with my performance?”

        “Nothing,” Bach replied, “It was flawless. Outstanding, even. But the Orchestra has no need for a Melodist who acts on his own whims.”

        “This-this is ABSURD! I—” Liszt stepped forward to defend himself, but a girl held him back, wrapping her arms around him so that he would not offend the principal conductor.

        “Don’t! Liszt! Calm down!” Mendelssohn, a fellow Melodist of the Nocturn Orchestra, pleaded, knowing all too well that Liszt’s reaction would only make things worse.

        In the end, Bach departed under the escort of Chopin, the conductor of the Nocturne Orchestra, leaving Liszt burning with indignation and Mendelssohn looking at him with a worried frown. 

        “Liszt, don’t worry,” Mendelssohn said, trying to comfort him. “I believe Maestro Bach will give you a second chance and let you become a melodist again if you work hard and prove yourself.”

        However, Liszt was too proud and ambitious to accept reality. So, he stormed off with a sharp sweep of his sleeve.

        “Harmony above all else? What nonsense!” Liszt spat, his voice seething with rage. “The capable should rise to the top—that is the only truth!”

        “Exactly. I couldn’t agree more,” A sultry voice suddenly sounded from behind Liszt. He turned around only to see a woman whom he recognized immediately—Paganini, the conductor of another orchestra.

        “Maestra Paganini,” Liszt greeted her with a scowl. Despite knowing her superior position, his foul mood had left no room in his mind for social etiquette. “Sorry, but I have things to do. Excuse me.”

        “Wait,” Paganini said softly. “I can make your wish come true.”

        “...What?” Liszt asked in disbelief.

        “To play freely as you desire—to be the incomparable on the stage,” Paganini said.

        “....And the price?”

        Paganini chuckled and said, “It’s simple. Just give the devil your soul.”</p>
