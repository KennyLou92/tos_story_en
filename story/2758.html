        <p>Origin of Demons - Supreme Reckoning Story Ch. 3

        Abadon and Beelzebub wanted to leave Belial and they had to fight for it. The fight eventually ended with the successful escape of Abadon and Beelzebub.

        Samael thought that she would not see them again. However, Abadon showed up again, attempting to steal Mastema’s soul; Beelzebub also came to protect his weak body. Seeing the two supporting each other, Samael’s heart softened. She blocked Azazel’s attack and let Abadon and Beelzebub go.

        Later, Azazel left after giving her a glare. Samael knew that he was going to Belial, who should come and ask her for an explanation soon.

        Samael didn’t go into panic or anxiety; instead, she felt a sense of relief waiting for her final judgment. As usual, she went to the laboratory and did the scheduled experiments, until storming footsteps broke the tranquility in the lab.

        Raising her head, Samael looked at the intruder whose face was still fine as always only that it was now stained with inexplicable turpitude and ruthlessness. The light that once defended her with a crown of thorns on his head and a coat draped on his shoulders was gone for good. 

        “...Master Belial,” Samael greeted him respectfully, lowering her eyes. Then it suddenly dawned on her that this was the most appropriate distance between him and her—as a superior and a subordinate.

        “Why did you let Abadon and Beelzebub off the hook?” It seemed that Belial was trying to control the anger inside him, yet the bulging veins and his gravelly tone revealed his sharpness.

        “Because they reminded me who we were a long time ago.”

        “Oh, yeah, so weak and powerless that they can only be trampled and manipulated.”

        “Is that all you could see?” The sorrowful words of Samael’s misery only made Belial even more frustrated.

        “What else do those two losers have?”

        “The unconditional trust and the willingness to sacrifice everything for each other.”

        “So now you’re talking about trust and sacrifices after letting them go behind my back?”

        “...You won’t understand… No, you never wanted to understand. How long have we ever talked about things other than power struggles...” said Samael blankly as if her mind slipped into the river of memory. ‘I can’t even recall when the last time we talked heart to heart was. You’ve changed so much——”

        “Enough!” Belial yelled. As if it was not enough, he swept all the instruments on the lab table with both his arms. The shrill noise of breaking glass echoed across the room, which intensified the atmosphere between them.

         Belial no longer hid his wrath and scolded Samael, “Stop fooling me with gibberish. Just tell me your intention.”

        “I’ve already told you, but you never believe——”

        “That’s just an excuse! I know your true intention.” Losing control, Belial stared at Samael tempestuously and growled, “It’s because you’ve fallen in love with Baal! You think he is more powerful and authoritative than me. That’s why you betrayed me and let those two losers go!”

        “Is it what you really think it is?” Samael’s face was overwhelmed with shock, sorrow and pain.

        “Yes, but I wonder how did you hook up with Baal in the first place. Was it with your body——”

        Slap! A resounding slap put a stop to Belial’s ceaseless accusation. As Samael finally came to the end of her tolerance, she could not help but move her hand. Yet, she was more embarrassed at that moment as though she was the one being slapped than the one giving it.

        Agitated, Samael’s chest rose and fell violently and she only calmed down after taking a few deep breaths. Then, she tilted her face away from the unrecognizable lover in front of her.

        “Now we’re both too emotional. There won’t be a conclusion even if we keep talking like this. I think we should spend some time alone,” said Samael, who then turned and walked towards the gate.

        ‘Even Samael is betraying me… No, I won’t let that happen.’ Madness filled Belial’s eyes. He abruptly stepped forward and grabbed the back of Samael’s head, with gloomy green light sparkling like an ominous sign.

        “Belial… St-stop...” Samael felt that her body had become empty; her soul was pulled away from her body even though she wanted to stay. Still, she couldn’t escape the fate of being torn apart. 

        With one of his hands holding Samael’s soul, Belial held her feeble body with the other. As a crazy and distorted smile crossed his face, he murmured with satiation, “Now you can’t betray me.”

         ‘No… Then you’ll be alone forever…’ Sorrows permeated into Samael’s heart and eventually turned into a crystal tear that trickled down from a corner of her eyes...</p>
