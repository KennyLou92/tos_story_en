        <h1>Highest Ranking Demon - Chandler</h1>
        <p>One of the highest-ranked demons who is known as “Pacifier Fiend”.

The master of Meliodas.

He was originally sealed away by the Goddess. As the seal is weakened by Zeldris, he and Cusack manage to break free. His usual appearance is a kind eldery who cares about Meliodas a lot. He becomes brutal and hard to handle in battle after revealing his true form, as if a fiend that sucks everything out of his enemy.
