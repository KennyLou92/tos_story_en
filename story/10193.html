        <h1>Otose</h1>
        <p>The owner of the Otose Snack House and the landlord of Yorozuya, in which Gintokiâ€™s outstanding rent bothers her.

She is a soft-heated and merciful woman who forgives and enlightens people even when they try to take her money.

She has the eyes that can make a hitman succumb and hands that can lift Gintoki and throw him into the air. She is indeed a quite powerful woman.

Despite her current appearance that is hard to tell apart from a man or Orochimaru, she was once a Japanese beauty and an idol in the Kabukicho.</p>
