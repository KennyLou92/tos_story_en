        <p>        “But those adults all thought they are fighting on the side of justice, while they view all devils as evil... Yet, in my view, devils are not necessarily evil.  There may be some virtuous ones.  How would we know?”

        Li Yi-Ru was the daughter of Li Hsiao-Yao and Zhao Ling-Er, with a frank personality that was tolerant of all.   Although she would not always treat her elders with manners and would sometimes be very naughty, she was very kindhearted.  Her life spent on Fairy Island meant that she did not have her mother by her side, and her father was also rarely there.  Due to how much she missed her father, she asked Wang Hsiao-Hu to accompany her to find him, and that was the beginning of her adventure...</p>
