        <h1>Love-devourer’s Whispers - Eve</h1>
        <p>
                “Mmm… Ahh…” A woman with short hair lay on a magnificent waterbed, painful moans escaping her lips. Her physical vessel had become rigid and heavy due to the prolonged separation of her body and soul, which was why the reunification of her physical and spiritual self caused her indescribably unbearable pain.

        “Finally, you’re awake, Samael,” a sweet voice exclaimed with delight, cutting through the woman’s torment. Samael’s vigilance prompted her to overcome the throes of discomfort and raised her head, fixing her gaze upon the source of the voice. There she saw a woman of mesmerizing beauty, whose mere presence momentarily eclipsed the feeling of misery that had consumed her.

        Not only did the woman possess a flawless countenance, but she also radiated an aura of ethereal allure. Her enigmatic charm beckoned restless souls to explore her every facet. She was Eve, a captivating seductress who had ensnared innumerable spirits within her beauty.

        Even Samael was momentarily entranced before she regained her composure and alertly asked, “Who are you? And what have you done to me?”

        “I’m Eve,” the woman replied, “I didn’t do much. I just saw a pitiful woman whose soul had been separated from her body. So, out of compassion, I restored your soul to its original vessel.”

        Samael was once a close confidante of Belial, Baal’s younger brother. However, their relationship deteriorated over their pursuit of power until Belial’s ego grew insufferable. The two had a heated argument which ended with Samael leaving him. In a fit of rage, Belial impulsively extracted Samael’s soul to keep her by his side.

        “Eve…the daughter of the grand duchess who fell in love with a god… Why did you help me?” Samael delved into her memories, recalling the rumors she had once heard, and recognized Eve’s identity.

        As the daughter of the grand duchess, Eve embarked on a journey in search of true love only to have her dream crushed. It was at her lowest ebb that she accepted Laplace and Baal’s invitation and joined their plan to conquer the world.

        “You actually know who I am. How delightful,” Eve exclaimed innocently, leaping onto the bed and giving Samael an ardent embrace which Samael, still regaining her strength, found herself unable to evade. Her body tensed in discomfort as she felt the unfamiliar warmth and softness pressing against her.

        “It’s nice to have another girl around. Girls are sweet, unlike Baal that scoundrel, always being lovey-dovey with Laplace while leaving all the work to me. I just don’t understand why he didn’t finish his brother after he mercilessly slayed his brother’s subordinate,” Eve complained in her honeyed voice. “He said it would make his people think he’s too cruel and ruthless, so he asked me to do it for him. But it’s such an unpleasant job and I hate it… Oh! I just got an idea!”

        Eve sat up straight, clapping her hands in excitement, her eyes sparkling with mischief as she suggested, “You two should have a duel!”

        “What…do you mean?” Samael struggled to keep pace with Eve’s erratic train of thought, her face marked by bewilderment.

        “You are Belial’s true love so you’re supposed to be executed as one of the rebels. But now, I’m going to give you a chance,” Eve said, her smile saccharine but laced with a toxic undertone. “Kill Belial, and I shall set you free.”

        Samael fell into silence, but her expression constantly shifted, revealing her conflicting emotions as she was torn by the definition of love. Yet, her struggles somehow intoxicated Eve.

        “I caught a glimpse of your memories when I restored your soul. I saw how deeply you once loved him, and yet, he betrayed you. You must harbor deep resentment against him,” Eve spoke, her finger softly hooking under Samael’s chin, her breath filled with a seductive allure akin to the scent of an apple. “Now is your chance to take revenge.”

        ‘I can’t fathom her intentions, but refusing her now would only mean death. I should play along with her for now.’  Samael hesitated for a moment, then finally nodded, “Fine, I’ll do it.”

        “Wonderful. Let me get everything prepared then,” Eve said as she left the room to set the wheels in motion for the coming duel.

        Several days later, Samael’s soul finally acclimated to her body, her movements regaining their fluidity. Following Eve, she arrived at the arena floor of the colosseum.

        Eve, seated in the closest rostrum, rested her chin on her hands in a cheerful mood. A curious smile danced upon her lips, and her bright eyes sparkled with excitement, just like a child.

        ‘I wonder if this is the day I witness the blossom of true love. Will Samael become an unwavering pursuer of love like you, Mother?’

        With a clank, the iron gate on the other side of the arena floor opened, revealing a man with emerald hair, his body covered with wounds, being pushed inside. He appeared terribly frail as he stumbled forward a few steps before collapsing to the ground.

        “Belial!” Reminiscences of Samael’s past relationship with Belial momentarily eclipsed the hatred she had harbored for him since he had extracted her soul. She reflexively hastened toward the fallen Belial with concern.

        Just as she was about to kneel beside him to assess his condition,  Belial abruptly surged to his feet and swiftly grabbed Samael’s collar. He deftly flipped her over, pinning her on the ground, and whispered into her ear, saying, “Samael, I knew you’ve betrayed me.”

        “No, I didn’t—”

        “Heh, enough with the excuses,” Belial sneered coldly, his voice devoid of kindness, “But this is also a perfect opportunity. I will grant you the power you yearn for, but in return, you must work with me.”

        “...Why should I listen to you when you can barely survive?”

        “Are you really that naive to think that my dear brother would spare you after you kill me?” Belial pressed on, strengthening his power of persuasion as he noticed Samael’s wavering. “There’s only Eve here now. If we unite our forces, we can hold her hostage and use her as leverage against Baal to secure substantial power. It’s definitely better than pledging allegiance to Baal.” 

        “But you are gravely wounded. How are you going to defeat Eve?”

        “I have the venom of the Dragon of Poison hidden beneath my nails. A small dose shall incapacitate her. Then, you and I can capture her together,” Belial explained.

        “...Fine,” Samael lowered her gaze, her expression inscrutable as she calmly agreed to Belial’s proposition.

        Upon reaching an agreement, Belial could hardly conceal his excitement. His face contorted with a ferocious intent. He had lost the charismatic splendor that once captivated Samael, only leaving her with an indescribable sense of unfamiliarity.

        Subsequently, Belial and Samael resumed their battle, engaging in a dance of exchanged blows while discreetly edging closer to Eve’s seat. Unaware of the unfolding scheme, Eve remained engrossed by the clash between them. Her smile grew increasingly radiant as if she had unearthed the most fascinating spectacle in the world.

        Finally, using a swift kick from Samael, Belial positioned himself beneath Eve. Summoning his remaining strength, he abruptly vaulted onto the spectator seats. With a menacing gaze, he locked eyes with Eve and proclaimed,

        “Surrender, and I shall spare you the pain— Hmm!”

        Swoosh!

        Eve’s eyes widened in astonishment as a sword impaled Belial’s abdomen from behind. Blood splattered in every direction. Strangely, not a single droplet tainted Eve’s pristine dress, as though someone had orchestrated it in a way that she would not be sullied by any substance of impurity.

        Belial was incredulous. He turned his head toward the woman standing behind him—Samael. He opened his bloodied mouth, uttering a question laced with the smell of blood, “Wh… Why…”

        “Belial, you still don’t understand. Not everyone is obsessed with power. You never once asked me what I truly desired,” Samael spoke in a solemn tone. She forcefully withdrew the sword, eliciting a painful grimace from Belial, whose eyes widened as they locked onto hers. Yet, she felt no anger or fear, only a hint of profound sorrow creeping up on her face.

        The once unbreakable bond between them now felt so foreign and repugnant, as if destiny had proved that her love for him was nothing more than a mistake. The regrets that had once caused her immense pain now turned into a deep sigh of resignation.

        Calmly, she told Belial his transgressions, “Your eyes never see anyone but yourself, and that is why you lost.”

        “You—” Even in Belial’s final moments, he still harbored the same resentment he had in his youthful years. He had been blindly chasing after the things that eluded his grasp throughout his entire life instead of cherishing the present.

        Suddenly, applause resounded crisply from the spectator seats.

        Eve’s fair cheeks flushed with excitement, her eyes shimmering with admiration.

        “As I expected, the only love that endures is self-love. Samael, you’ve done a marvelous job,” Eve exclaimed, her eyes curving into a smile with a seductive charm. Extending her arms toward Samael, she playfully enticed, “I like you a lot. Come and join me, would you?”

        ‘Belial was right, Baal will not abide by my presence. I must find someone in a high place before he eliminates me…and Eve is a fitting choice,’ Samael pondered.

        Without hesitation, Samael accepted Eve’s offer. She gracefully dropped to one knee and took Eve’s hand, respectfully planting a kiss on her knuckles.

        “I desire to follow you, my lady,” Samael declared.

        “Hehe, good girl,” Eve giggled with joy. Every motion and gesture she made exuded an innocent and genuine charm, enrapturing the hearts of all. The world would move to her every smile and frown.

        Extending her arms, she threw herself into Samael’s embrace as she tenderly whispered, “Come with me. Let’s find more enduring and everlasting love in this world!”</p>
