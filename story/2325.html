        <h1>Hilarious Comedian - Leed</h1>
        <p>
                A sunny afternoon, the audience were watching a show inside a full-house circus tent.

        “Hohohoho…”

        Leed, a flamboyantly-dressed clown, was juggling while making exaggerated laughter. As he blew the trumpet hard, a glittering bubble was blown out to wrap himself up. Meanwhile, he acted like trapped inside the bubble, making a terrified face.

        “Woooo...wow!”

        When the bubble burst, Leed made a surprised face. All the audience were amused, laughing out loud.

        With a hand clap, Leed summoned a couple of clown-dressed gnomes from a black box behind him. While the funny gnomes were striking gongs running around the stage, Leed blew his trumpet to produce more glittering bubbles. As the show reached the climax, the laughter echoed over the circus.

        However, Leed who turned his face away from the crowd was not happy at all. A thought came up when his grin faded, “Sigh...They’re happy, but so what...Thy joy will be gone soon anyway…”

        After the show, the frustrated Leed returned to the locker room and thought, “I’ve been amusing people since I was small, but why do I have to?”

        Leed left the tent with gloom and grumpiness. At this moment, a childish voice called from behind.

        “Mr. Clown! Mr. Clown”

        “...Strange. Why can he recognise me without my makeup?” Turning around out of curiosity, Leed saw a 7ish boy.

        “Mr. Leed the clown, my name is Gulu. I’m your fan! Can you make me a huge bubble now?” Gulu asked, looking at Leed with his big lucid eyes. Most of the people would say yes to a request from a little boy, but Leed only found him annoying.

        “Of course not! The show’s over. Why should I perform for you again? Go away!” Leed yelled at the boy.

        The blunt refusal broke the little boy’s heart, who held his tears and said, “Leed is an idiot!” 

        After yelling back at Leed, Gulu ran away.

        “Tut! How rude are the kids nowadays. I’ll punch you in the face if I ever see you again!” Leed refuted, making a punching pose.

        “Huh?”

        Someone patted Leed’s shoulder suddenly; when he turned around, he saw Maurice the ringmaster.

        “Leed, what was that?” The ringmaster asked calmly.

        “...It’s his fault! He asked for a free performance after my working hour!”

        This question revealed all the frustration and resentment within Leed. He continued, “I make myself a fool just to amuse people, but so what? Their joy disappears when the show’s over!  It’s meaningless”

        Maurice looked at Leed sadly after hearing his words. “...Leed, don’t force yourself if this job means suffering to you,” he replied.

        “Sir, so you’re firing me now?” Leed stared at the ringmaster and yelled, “great! Exactly what I want!”

        Leed stormed away and didn’t calm down until he had walked for a while. When he stopped, he glimpsed at a crying boy standing on the pavement. He was Gulu, who was part of the reason Leed got fired. 

        “None of my business. Just get past him!” 

        Leed sped up as he had this idea in his mind, but a pair of tiny hands had grabbed him already.

        “Hey! Why are you grabbing me? Go find your mother!” Leed tried to get rid of Gulu but failed.

        “I can’t find her…” 

        Gulu pouted with tears rolling in his eyes.

        “Ugh...How unlucky can I be? First I lost my job, and now I just got into this mess.”

        “Where did you separate with your mother?” Leed asked sternly, rubbing his eyebrows. 

        “Boohoo...I don’t know...Wahhh!”

        All the pedestrians looked at them when Gulu cried harder, which also freaked Leed out.

        “No! People will think that I’m the one who made him cry!” Leed thought.

        To avoid more troubles, Leed led Gulu to a tree. Then he said to Gulu, “wait for me here.”

        The weeping Gulu nodded, watching Leed run to the back of the tree.

        “Ta-da! Gulu, what is this?”

        When Leed returned, he was already in his clown appearance. He then blew out a huge glittering bubble and said, “it’s a huge bubble!”

        Gulu’s eyes were caught by the bubble.

        “Let us find your mother with the bubble, alright?” Leed smiled at Gulu. With another hard blow, Gulu was surrounded by glittering bubbles.

        “Okay!” Gulu forgot about the fear as he was carried away by the bubbles.

        “Nail it!” Leed felt proud; he held Gulu’s hand and said, “alright. Let’s go!”

        Holding each other’s hand, Leed the clown and Gulu walked around with the company of bubbles. A lot of people were attracted by this scene, gathering around.

        “Mama!” Gulu suddenly shouted. At this moment, a woman ran over and held the boy in her arms.

        “Next time, stay close with your mother,” said Leed with arms akimbo.

        “Thank you so much, Mr. Leed!” Gulu became energetic again after reuniting with his mother.

        Coming to Leed, Gulu spoke awkwardly, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have called you an idiot earlier...I used to be bullied at school, and those days were hellish. I couldn’t laugh until I watched your show, and it gave me the courage to stand up against the torment…”

         “Laugh...courage...stand up against torment…”

        Leed suddenly became wide awake.

        “Right...The reason why I amuse people is to take their pain away...Why did I forget it…”

        Gulu’s words resolved the frustration inside Leed. A genuine smile finally appeared on his face again.

        “No, I should be the one to thank you. Thank you for reminding me of the passion.”

        “Huh?” Gulu was confused, but the innocent mind didn’t think too much. He put the perplexion away, held Leed’s hand and said, “I’ll come to your next show!”

        It reminded Leed of the fact that he had already been fired. “But I was fired already...No. I can’t give up. I still want to be a clown. But it doesn’t matter. I can apply for the job again!” As this thought popped up in his head, hope was ignited in his heart.

        “Alright! I promise you that I’ll bring you an even more amazing show!” Leed smacked his chest confidently.

        Few months later, a ridiculously dressed clown came to a circus tent.

        “Get ready to laugh your guts out!”
