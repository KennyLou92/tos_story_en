        <h1>Flattering Komainu - Furry</h1>
        <p>
        Oh My Youkai - Ch.1

        There were a lot of nations and creatures residing on the vast realm. At this moment, a nerve-wrecking scream sounded in an insignificant state on the east continent, scaring the hell out of the petty demons.

        “Zero.Zero. Zero…! They are all ZERO——!”

        The yell came from “Grand Villa” the hot spring tourist attraction, where there was a huge poster at the entrance with an eye-catching slogan “THE BEST HOT SPRING YOU CAN GET”. Yet the decorations were already in disrepair, including the billboard.

        Inside the lobby, Furry the komainu’s ears tingled because of the loud yell, but he forced a smile to suppress the annoyance. 

        “WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!? WHY THE HELL IS THE REVENUE ZERO!?” The landlord, sitting on his chaise lounge, was roaring at his youkai minions, which made his pile of fat wiggle.

        “Of course it’s not true. Master, with your fame, everyone is just crazy about this place. They must be all coming at once and that jams the traffic in the midway,” Furry flattered the landlord and fanned him immediately.

        “Huh? You’re still finding excuses for your incompetence!”

        The landlord splashed his saliva onto the minions, making them wet, but none of them had the nerve to wipe it away.

        “If the situation goes on, you guys will never get your treasures back!”

        The petty youkais lowered their heads without making a sound. In fact, the landlord didn’t own the youkais, and none of them saw him as their master. The reason why they were here was because they had been captured by him once, and he had taken away their treasures. Without the treasures, the youkais lost their full strength, which made them enslaved by the landlord. 

        The landlord became even more arrogant as no youkais defied him. With a sneer, he made harsh requests at them.

        “If I don’t see a full house in a week, all of you will get barbecued! Also, the youkai who makes the least revenue will become everyone’s dinner!”

        “YES SIR!” Furry was the only energetic one at the scene, while the others stared at him in disdain.

        “Hmm, what should I get for lunch today? Pork stew or sashimi?” The obese landlord left in heavy steps.

        Just when the youkais were about to dismiss, Furry stopped them with a flattering grin.

        “My dear friends, please listen to me! Now that with this threat, all of us will be dead if we fail! Why don’t we combine our efforts and get through it together? United we stand!”

        “No way.”

        Bake-danuki, a well-built youkai, rejected Furry’s offer with his arm crossed. Daruma, another red rounded youkai, stopped rolling around to nod.

        “Daruma.” Guess Dadaru was saying “same for me”.

        “Wait!” Furry was trying to further persuade them.

        All the youkais were either picking ears or yawning. The one thing in common was that they all left without giving a damn to Furry.

        “Furry is the worst. Not only does he play pranks on us, but he gets us into trouble all the time…”

        “Exactly! Flattering is the only thing he can do. Maybe we should get rid of the black sheep this time.”

        “Daruma daruma.”

        As all the youkais had left the scene, the irritated Furry yelled, “JUST WAIT AND SEE! I WILL PAY BACK ONE DAY——!”

        When he calmed down, he popped his eyes out as if he had figured something out.

        “Did they...find out that I stole their lunch boxes? Or the thing that I framed Maneki-neko for breaking the landlord’s favorite plant a week ago?”

        Furry’s face went pale as he thought, “I’ve got no talents except flattering. I’ll be doomed without them…”

        Driven by the anguish and anxiety, he decided to stick with his “creed”.

        “Then let’s go down together! Hahaha! How genius I am! Nothing good happens if anyone pisses me off!”

        Furry, proud of his wit, ran away to find his first target with the idea of “if I burn, you burn with me”...
