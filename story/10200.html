        <h1>Mesmerizing Tune - Mollyanna</h1>
        <p>Mollyanna Dia, the universally famous pop singer. For some reason, she looks very similar to Molly, the Elementalist in old age.

With a cheerful personality and distinctive styles as her trademark, her positive image has made her a desirable spokesperson for many merchandisers.
Having excellent physical strength, she can sing for a long time without a break. Passionate about singing and performing, she hopes she can project her energy to her fans through her work.
In spite of her love for desserts, she controls herself for the fear of gaining weight. Her dream is to taste all kinds of desserts around the universe.</p>
