        <h1>Intergalactic Combo - Mitty and Marble</h1>
        <p>
                After regaining his memories, Ophiuchus decided to leave alone so as to keep Mitty and Marble safe. Reluctant to bid farewell to Ophiuchus, Mitty and Marble tried to track him down with his scent.

        The long journey eventually led them to Ophiuchus again in front of the Enochian Tower. Before they had a moment to celebrate the reunion, however, they saw him being attacked by Pontos.

        To save Ophiuchus, Mitty and Marble attacked Pontos at the same time and knocked him off his feet. Yet, they soon fell into a tight corner. Luckily, Ophiuchus saved them and restored the balance of the fight. The two parties stared at each other in silence.

        “This man holds tremendous elemental power. We need to find a way to tie him down.” At such thought, Ophiuchus kicked his leg with all his strength while swinging his right fist forward. Unexpectedly, Pontos also threw a straight punch at him. The two ended up dashing toward each other—

        ——Boom! The two fists touched, creating gusts of wind that blew away the dust on the ground.

        Pontos’ powerful punch sent tingles through Ophiuchus’ hand which led to a frown on his face. On the other hand, Pontos gave him a bellicose smile and took a step forward with his right fist covered in a ball of blue light, ready to make the strike.

        Marble, who sensed the danger, then shouted at Mitty, ‘Mitty, do it!’

        Mitty immediately summoned its astralist power and moved to the back of Pontos like a flash of lightning. Just when it was about to dig its claws into his back, Pontos said, ‘Do you really think I’ll fall for the same trick again?’

        It seemed that Pontos had already known. Instead of landing on Ophiuchus, his right fist went upward. Immense aqua power rose from the ground and turned into countless water snakes that coiled around Mitty and Ophiuchus’ bodies, hanging them in the air until they could barely move.

        Although Ophiuchus and Mitty kept struggling, they began to lose their strength and consciousness under the tight coil of water snakes.

        ‘This works pretty well,’ said Pontos, cracking a malicious grin. Conjuring two aqua spears in the air, he aimed them at their chests.

        Seeing that, Marble recalled how Orion died before him. Gritting its teeth, it smashed its body toward Pontos in desperation.

        ‘STOP IT!’

        However, little Marble’s tackle was nothing but a scratch to a mountainous man like Pontos, who caught it easily. Just when Pontos was about to fling Marble away, the latter bit his right hand hard.

        ‘So you want to die first, huh?!’ Pontos shouted in rage, using his left hand to catch Marble. The flickering blue light on his hand sent a chill down Marble’s spine.

        “Is there nothing I can do now? No… not this time!”

        As starlight gathered on Marle’s body, a powerful blast shot from its forehead at Pontos with sparks and bolts. Pontos immediately let go of Marble and tilted his head to dodge the attack that landed right past him.

        After dodging the thunderbolt, Pontos made a full swing at Marble and knocked it into the air, saying, ‘Is that all you’ve got? You stupid dog! Now die!’

        In the narrow space between the ground and his arm, Pontos saw an unexpected smile on Marble’s face that shocked him. By the time he tried to take a step back, a giant paw had pierced through his body with countless bolts.

‘Don’t, don't bully, bully, Marble! Standing behind Pontos, Mitty was shrouded in dangerous lightning.

        “So I wasn’t its target all along?!” Unfortunately, Pontos’ realization came too late since thunder had run through all his body from the giant paw.

        Pontos gave a roar and blasted Mitty and Marble away with the power of elements like an injured beast. The blue light on his body suddenly began to flicker.

        ‘You… Damn it! You’re not getting away with this! I will make you pay—— Argh!’ Numerous wooden snakes emerged from the ground and stopped Pontos’ threat. It was Ophiuchus, who conjured the wooden snakes and manipulated them to wrap around Pontos’ body tightly.

        ‘Mitty! Marble!’ As soon as Ophiuchus shouted their names, Mitty and Marble simultaneously released a thunderbolt at Pontos.

        ‘ARGHHHH——!’ Pontos let out a long painful cry that gradually weakened and subsided into silence, with its burly body falling to the ground feebly.

        It was then Ophiuchus and the two dogs breathed a sigh of relief. As weary as they were, they climbed up the tower while supporting each other. Little did they know that they would encounter another group of formidable enemies soon…</p>
