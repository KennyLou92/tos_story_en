        <h1>The Great Rabbits</h1>
        <p>
        The Great Rabbits are a colony of rabbits that are one of the three Great Mabeasts created by the Witch of Gluttony, Daphne. Having an appearance akin to small rabbits with horns, they can multiply infinitely. Driven by an insatiable sense of hunger, they devour their prey to the bone. It is commonly reckoned that the “great” in Great Rabbits refers to their size for as long as anyone can remember but it actually refers to their number.</p>
