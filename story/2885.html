        <h1>Eclipse of Infinity - Erebus</h1>
        <p>
                Amidst the relentless war between the gods, the summoner, and the Courts of Zodiacs in the realm of gods, Erebus was released from the chaotic void. Upon regaining his freedom, he hastened toward the entrance of the realm of gods, only to discover his fellow gods in a disadvantageous position, suppressed by the summoner and his companions. He promptly stepped inside the battlefield to intervene, but Poppy and Alma, the Court of Aries and the Court of Scorpio, stood in his way so the summoner could proceed.

        As increasingly anxious as Erebus was, he had no choice but to fight against the Zodiacs. As the situation reached a stalemate, a young girl suddenly appeared, launching fierce attacks indiscriminately against everyone present. Erebus, who refused to stay submissive, tapped into his chaotic power amidst the adversity and defeated the girl, knocking her unconscious to the ground.

        “This is the fate of those who stand in my way!” said Erebus triumphantly. With the overwhelming chaotic power flowing over his entire body, he felt invincible and invigorated. A pleased smile appeared on his face as he turned and walked in the direction the summoner had headed. Yet, two figures blocked his path.

        “Zodiacs…you despicable traitors! How dare you turn your backs on the esteemed gods and help those detestable pests!” Erebus glared at Poppy and Alma, his eyes burning with mounting rage.

        “YOU are the detestable ones!” Poppy showed no signs of fear in the face of the wrathful powerful god. With her sword firmly gripped in her hand, she resolutely retorted, clear and loud, “You gods have deceived humans, asking them to build the tower under the guise of redemption when your true purpose is to extract the power of this realm! You are the embodiment of enormity!”

        “Humph! Insignificant ants like them should feel lucky to help us Holy Gods achieve our glory and they should be grateful!” Erebus declared arrogantly, holding an unwavering belief about the Holy Gods’ pre-eminent status above all the other races, oblivious to his kind’s wrongdoings.

        “You—!” As infuriated as Poppy was, she found herself lost for words upon hearing Erebus’ unreasonable statement. Alma, standing by her side, patted her arm and comforted her, “Don’t bother arguing with them. These gods are all self-righteous. They can’t be reasoned with. There’s only one way to stop such stubborn creatures…”

        Alma’s eyes flickered as her hand quietly grasped her scythe. She exchanged a glance with Poppy and continued, “That is to fight them!”

        Before Alma finished her sentence, she planted her feet and forcefully pushed off the ground, charging toward Erebus at a high speed while raising her scythe high to strike at him.

        Instead of evading the attack, Erebus channeled the chaotic power within his body, reaching out a hand to meet Alma—

        Clang! Alma’s scythe was knocked away by the force of chaotic power. Meanwhile, Erebus seized Alma by the throat, lifting her high in the air. He let out a maniacal laugh before he superciliously proclaimed, “What an ignorant fool! Did you really think your attack could harm me? How naive—urgh!”

        A sharp pain suddenly struck Erebus’s back, followed by a strong sense of paralysis spreading from the wound. The numbness forced him to release Alma and drop to his knee. 

        “This is the consequence of being too arrogant,” Alma withdrew the scorpion tail she had used to ambush Erebus. It was the toxin from her metasoma that paralyzed him. Soon after she retrieved her scythe, she pressed it against Erebus’s neck and whispered, “Now atone for your sins with your life.”

        ‘No… I’m not losing to these despicable traitors. I am Erebus, the son of Khaos, the Lord of Chaos, and I WILL NOT succumb to such a pathetic end!’ Unexpectedly, Erebus’ intense resentment unleashed the dormant chaotic power within him which began to swirl and expel the toxin that had immobilized him.

        Unaware of Erebus’ awakened power, Alma swung her scythe to finish her enemy, only to be caught by Erebus, who had rid himself of the toxin. With a powerful tug, he threw Alma aside, sending her and the scythe hurtling toward a corner littered with sharp debris.

        “Alma!” Poppy, standing guard nearby, shouted anxiously and rushed toward Alma. Fortunately, she managed to catch Alma before she hit the ground, but Alma had already lost consciousness due to the impact.

        “Now perish!” Yet, Erebus showed no mercy. He mustered the surging chaotic power within his body, transforming it into a fierce beam of energy directed at Poppy and Alma.

        Poppy hastily raised her Shield of Aries to shield herself and Alma from the vicious assault. She did not flinch in the face of Erebus’ overpowering attack, but stood her ground, using her shield to protect her companion. Yet, her resolute and upright stance only further agitated Erebus and intensified his disgust.

        ‘The world is all about powers. The strong should have it all. Those weak and inept humans don’t deserve the resources of this realm! And the Zodiacs, we gave them their powers, and yet they dare defy us for those distasteful pests! They can’t be forgiven!’

        The beam of chaotic power grew stronger as Erebus’ disdain for the Zodiacs intensified, ruthlessly pouring and crashing upon Poppy with a tyrannical force like a waterfall. It grew so strong that even Poppy’s shield which had been blessed by the Astralist of Aries could not withstand. Eventually, it cracked while Poppy and Alma were sent hurtling through the air, crashing into a wall before sliding to the ground, unconscious.

        “Humph! This is the fate of the weak!” Erebus sneered with contempt. Just as he was about to annihilate Poppy and Alma, he heard a flurry of footsteps and calls directed at the two Courts of Zodiacs.

        “Tut! The other Zodiacs and reinforcements have arrived...” After a moment of hesitation, Erebus decisively abandoned the idea of eliminating Poppy and Alma. Instead, he ran toward the direction where the summoner had left, determined to stop those abominable humans from thwarting his father Khaos’ plan...</p>
