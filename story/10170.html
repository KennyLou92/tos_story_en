        <h1>Euphonious Crooning - Melody</h1>
        <p>Date of Birth: 23 Feb

A Mussong.
As a descendant of Zana, she has been chosen to be one of the three guardians of Pilgrimage.
Having great talents in conducting, she becomes incredibly serious once she starts playing music, which is completely different from her usual squeamish demeanor.
She is the older sister of Nocturne. The two share a strong sisterhood. Yet, they seldom see each other since Nocturne has started working, which makes Melody feel lonely.</p>
