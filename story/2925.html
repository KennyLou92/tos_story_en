        <h1>One Thousand Wishes  - Genie</h1>
        <p>
                Under the pale light of a full moon, two opposing factions clashed fiercely within the dense forest. Blood rained as flesh was torn under the clashing swords and magical explosion, staining the lush green earth a deep crimson. Countless lives were lost in the brutal conflict, leaving only a lone knight and a sorcerer standing on the battlefield. Both were battered and bloodied, barely clinging to life, yet neither would yield.

        They were both nobles from a certain nation, each fueled by one objective: to claim the fabled magical oil lamp, no matter the cost.

        “Die!” With a final, desperate strike, the knight emerged victorious. He raised the gleaming golden lamp high above his head, his face alight with triumph. Yet, his celebration was cut short by a last-ditch spell from the dying sorcerer.

        The coveted lamp slipped from the knight’s trembling fingers. It tumbled to the side and rolled into a nearby river. Carried by the stream, it eventually came to rest on a shallow bank amidst a pile of debris where only the pale moonlight bore witness to its true form.

        ‘At last, it’s over…’ sighed Genie, the spirit bound to the lamp. For as long as he could remember, countless men had fought through bloodshed in pursuit of his wish-granting powers. The loss of lives had never brought him joy but only sorrow and despair, which was why even as he lay abandoned on the riverbank, possibly for centuries to come, he felt no fear or loneliness—only relief.

        ‘Now, no one will die because of me.’ Genie thought.

        However, his peace was short-lived.

        A young woman came sprinting along the river. Amidst her clumsy and unsteady steps, she failed to noticethe debris strewn across the ground and tripped, landing hard on her bottom. 

        “Ouch… That hurts… Huh?” She winced as her eyes caught a glimmer of gold. Out of curiosity, she brushed aside the trash and uncovered the shimmering lamp.

        “This looks like a very valuable lamp. What’s it doing in the garbage?” The woman, Ada, muttered, running her fingers over the lamp. There on the bottom, she found some strange markings. “These look like ancient symbols… Uh oh! I-I’m going to be late!”

        Ada, suddenly remembering her job as a university teaching assistant, hastily stuffed the lamp into her bag and dashed off to work, barely making it in time.

        The morning passed in a blur, and it was not until lunchtime that Ada finally had a moment to breathe. When she opened her bag to take out her meal, she spotted the lamp she had found earlier inside. Setting her lunch aside, she picked up the lamp for a closer look.

        “These symbols do look familiar,” Ada murmured, “I think I’ve seen them in one of those old manuscripts…” Unable to contain her curiosity, she took the lamp and dashed to the university library where she found a book on ancient inscriptions after digging through a dusty corner.

        “Hmm… ‘Only...one who reads my name... and dusts me… shall become my master’…” Ada read aloud, her face wrinkling in a thoughtful frown. “Does it mean I have to wipe it clean?”

        She took out her handkerchief and gently wiped the lamp while whispering the name engraved on it, “Genie?”

        Boom! White smoke billowed from the lamp’s spout, and a plump, golden figure emerged. Ada yelped in terror, dropping the lamp as she screamed, “Ahhh! A-a ghost!”

        “How rude! I am no ghost,” the figure declared indignantly, crossing his arms as he glared at the shaking woman, “I am Genie, the spirit of this wish-granting lamp.”

        “A wish-granting lamp?”

        “That’s right. I can grant you three wishes. Now, tell me, what is your heart’s desire?” asked Genie.

        “Umm…” Ada hesitated, her face twisting in thought. “I’ve never thought about this question before, and I… I can’t think of anything right now.”

        ‘That’s a first—I’ve never met someone who doesn’t know what to wish for,’ Genie thought, letting out a sigh. “Well, there’s no rush. Take your time. Just call me when you’ve made up your mind.”

        “Are you going back to the lamp?”

        “Yes. Is there something else you need?”

        “I’m going to have lunch. Would you like to join me?” Ada asked with a warm smile. Her kind invitation took Genie by surprise. Though he had met masters who treated him well, no one had ever regarded him so kindly as if he were just a normal friend.

        Unable to refuse Ada’s offer, Genie agreed. That first meal together marked the beginning of a bond that would deepen over time. One lunch turned into many, and soon Genie grew accustomed to living with Ada.

        Ada was the only child of her family. Having lost her parents at a young age, she became reserved and introverted. With few friends, she found pleasure and solace in books, and her academic excellence eventually led to her position as a university teaching assistant. Her simple and unassuming life left her with no burning desires, and as such, she never asked Genie to grant her a single wish.

        Years turned into decades, and Ada became an old and frail lady. Even so, she never once used the lamp’s power. On her deathbed, Genie stood by her side, his heart heavy with sorrow and confusion. “Why did you never make a wish?” he asked, “You know you could have simply asked me to restore your youth…”

        Ada shook her head and said, “Genie, immortality isn’t necessarily a gift. Life is only precious because it ends. The same goes for wishes. Magically granted wishes don’t bring people true joy; they can never be as fulfilling as achievements made through hard work.”

        “But I’m the wish-granting lamp—I’m supposed to make your wishes come true…”

        “You did, Genie,” Ada said with a serene smile. “You granted my greatest wish by staying by my side. You gave me companionship in a life that could have been unbearably lonely.”

        Genie remained by Ada’s side until her final breath. When she passed peacefully, the magic binding Genie to her broke. His form dissolved into mist, and he disappeared, destined to find his next master in another corner of the realm…</p>
