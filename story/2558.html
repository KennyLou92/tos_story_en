        <h1>Bloom amid the Thorns - Diarmuid</h1>
        <p>        In the night of a jungle, sparks flew for no reason, scaring off all the fireflies that scattered like beams of light. Moving against the flow of light, Diarmuid walked towards the source of fire alarmingly with his lances.

        He held up his lances, preparing for the enemies that could come at any time. For his undivided attention, however, he was unaware of the flashes of light floating around him, while Amor felt something familiar when the tip of her lance touched the light. As she looked around, she found that the flashes were gathering a spot unusually, forming a loose figure…

        The moment Amor wanted to notify her master, Diarmuid had already assumed the lance-throwing posture——swoosh!  As the lance of Amor hit the target, a Demon fell to the ground. Yet, a rustling sound came from the bushes as if something had fled while the fire also spread in that direction.

        After Diarmuid plucked out his lance, he walked over only to find that a bunch of Demons were setting fire wantonly in the forest while abducting some creatures…the spirits! Although he had heard about the spirits from Isabel several times, this was the first time he saw it with his own eyes. Spirits were something that his lover treasured. Now that the place of memory was being sabotaged and ruined, a murderous intent that made Diarmuid’s blood boil rose from the bottom of his heart…

        Diarmuid threw his lance right at a Demond leader the moment he saw him shouting to his subordinates—as the lance pierced through the Demon’s chest, he fell to the ground with a shrill scream of pain. Shocked and enraged, the Demons around immediately dashed towards Diarmuid with their weapons after they located him. Yet, this attack aroused the agitation inside Diarmuid’s heart again. The unstoppable killing lust exasperated him to the point of madness that he pushed away all the attacking Demons with a swing of his lances.

        ‘This place is full of the memories of me and Isabel. I won’t allow anyone to destroy it, not even a thought of destroying it!’

        Amor and Celos transformed to lances and fought with Diarmuid, who had slipped into the swirl of madness. As countless flashes of green light blazed with the flying lances, all the Demons were wiped out one by one.

        The stab didn’t stop even though the enemies had become a pulp of flesh. Amor, who calmed down, started to have a strange feeling… No, more exactly, she felt a chill in her heart. The anxiety that had been buried deep in her heart resurfaced.  Sensing her sister’s thoughts and the abnormality of her master, Celos yet didn’t have the heart to speak up.

        Back in the days when Diarmuid was bent on vengeance, they both spared no effort to help their master. Now, however, slaughter seemed to have become the only thing in his head…

        ‘Mas-Master, we have defeated all the Demons!’ yelled Amor worriedly when she saw Diarmuid point his lances to the elves that had just got away from the Demons. Conjuring her powers, she wanted to stop Diarmuid and so did Celos. Yet, their powers were still no match to their master’s that they could only fretfully watch as a cold smile tugged at the corner of his mouth.

        Then, a human figure formed by the flickers of white light flew towards Diarmuid with two beams of interlacing soft light, as though two arms were wrapping his neck from the back… Not did that gentle warmth gladden the hearts of Amor and Celos, but also solaced the one of Diarmuid, who stopped and looked up at that light.

        “It’s enough, my dear…” Diarmuid only recognized that it was the call of his loved one when a familiar female voice sounded in his heart.

        The moment the soft light slid through the burning bushes, the fire there went out. Looking at the fleeting dance of the flowing light, Diarmuid unknowingly shed a tear. With all those years passing by, it still seemed like yesterday that the girl had never left him.

        “I shall be always by your side as long as your love and jealousy never end.”

        Reaching out his hands, Diarmuid wanted to touch the light. Yet, it dissipated before him and turned into flickers of white light that slowly landed on Amor and Celos.

        That was when he finally realized what his loved one meant—his love and jealousy embodied the memories of Isabel. She would live in his heart as long as the Red Rose and the Yellow Rose kept blooming.

        “The three of us shall stay together forever and be the thriving roses on the battlefield!”</p>
