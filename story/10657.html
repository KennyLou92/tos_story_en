        Galactic Odyssey - Ch. 3

        [b][i]Dear Professor Galois,

        It has been one hundred years and twenty-one days since you left me, and today is the day I seek revenge for you.

        You were kind and passionate. You sympathized with those battlecruisers and their Guides who possessed strength but lacked wisdom and emotions, yet they returned your kindness by mercilessly taking your life. And those arrogant and ignorant bastards continued to mock and ridicule you even after your death.

        Witnessing such absurdity, I cannot help but despise the world, despise the fate that brings suffering to the kind ones. Consumed by an unfathomable anger, I have been torn day and night. Only by obliterating those who have wronged and murdered you will I ever find solace.

        I will resort to any means, even sacrificing innocent beings, if it means avenging you.

        I will use their lives to mourn you, Professor Galois.

        Your closest friend,
        Laura Bassi[/i][/b]


        In the incineration chamber on the lower deck of Montana, the battlecruiser, three human teenagers lay unconscious in the center, while a female machina stood before a small incinerator, turning its heat beyond safe levels through the control panel. 

        The female machina, named Laura Bassi, was a special agent from the Oroz Management Center, tasked with handling interstellar missions.

        Some days ago, the management center intercepted the navigation signal of a fugitive battlecruiser, Montana, which had been wanted for a hundred years. Laura and another senior agent named Kepler were dispatched to the cosmos for a capture operation.

        However, during their journey, they happened to catch sight of an enormous Midden attacking a tourist spacecraft. At the insistence of Kepler, they went to the rescue, but the Midden’s power was overwhelmingly great, and Kepler ended up in its grip.

        Just as Kepler was about to be crushed by the Midden, Montana and his Guide, Scáthach, appeared in the nick of time and saved him, ultimately sheltering them and the passengers on the tourist spacecraft.

        Despite being saved by Montana. Laura’s hatred for battlecruisers remained unquenchable. To her dismay, Kepler lost their secret weapon against battlecruisers—the key of Lilith, the synthetic soul—when he fought against the Midden.

        Laura suggested using the passengers on the tourist spaceship as bait to lure Scáthach, but Kepler firmly declined her idea.

        ‘Since he refused to help, then so be it. I will do it on my own,’ Laura thought to herself, maintaining a bright smile as she agreed with Kepler. After reassuring Kepler, she left his cabin to proceed with her plan alone.

        With her affable disguise, Laura successfully deceived three curious teenage humans, leading them to the incineration chamber on the lower deck. Then she used her power to disrupt the signals of the chamber, preventing Montana from monitoring or entering the room with his android. She incapacitated the unarmed teenagers and hacked into the incineration system, switching the temperature out of the safe limit. All that was left for her to do was to patiently wait for her prey.

        As she expected, hurried footsteps soon sounded, followed by a young girl arriving at the door. She was Scáthach, the Guide of Montana. Upon seeing the three teenagers sprawled on the floor, she dashed into the room without hesitation, intending to carry them out of the chamber. However, a mechanical restraint device emerged from the shadows, pinning Scáthach against the wall.

        “What is this… I can’t break free!”

“You can’t break it. This is a device designed to apprehend disobedient fugitives. It intercepts the flow of elements so that criminals are unable to use magic,” Laura stepped out from the shadows, wearing a friendly smile as she gazed at Scáthach.

        “Laura?” asked Scáthach in a kind and polite tone despite being attacked, “Did you mistake me for someone else? I am not a fugitive. I’m the Guide of Montana. We have been patrolling the space to uphold universal safety.”

        “No, I didn’t. One hundred years ago, one of the battlecruisers, along with its Guide, launched a terror attack on a space station, resulting in the deaths of all 1,625 station personnel. It took the joint operation of the Heptara Unies and machinas to finally take control of the situation. Still, nearly ten thousand casualties were incurred during the operation, leading the world to reconsider the safety of battlecruisers.”

        “No! That couldn’t be!” Scáthach vehemently retorted in disbelief, “Montana and I were assigned to a cosmic patrol mission!”

        “Yes, that was because your memory has been overwritten. According to the final verdict of the Heptara Unies, dreadful murder weapons like you were supposed to be destroyed. However, Gamma, one of the researchers, couldn’t bear to see you obliterated, so she went against the order. She released all the remaining battlecruisers into the cosmos, including you, and even overwrote your memory so that you wouldn’t feel upset,” Laura explained.

        “I-I don’t believe it! You’re lying!” Scáthach exclaimed.

        “Heh. Everything I’ve said is true. Or why do you think no one has ever contacted you in the past century? Why were you sent to desolate zones of the galaxy where there are no living beings to patrol for security? It was all done to prevent you from being discovered.”

        “That’s not true… No… I’m not… Montana and I are not wanted criminals…” Scáthach struggled to deny, but deep down, she was convinced by Laura’s words which aligned with the doubts that had plagued her for nearly a century, doubts she had never dared to delve into or investigate.

        “I understand that it’s difficult for you to accept the truth right away, but that’s how cruel reality is,” said Laura, smiling kindly while extending a hand toward Scáthach. “But I know you’re different, Scáthach. You are kind and empathic. You saved me and the passengers on the tourist spacecraft. If you hand over control of Montana to me now, I will plead on your behalf to the higher-ups for a lenient punishment.”

        Scáthach looked at Laura whose smile remained gentle. Yet, the hostility hidden in her eyes sent a chill down Scáthach’s spine. “No, you won’t plead for me and Montana. You’d rather see us both obliterated.”

        The smile on Laura’s face suddenly vanished, replaced by a cold, unemotional expression. She said, “Yeah, you’re right. I’d love to see all of you gone, so hand over control if you don’t want to suffer.”

        “No, I won’t! I won’t hand over control to you, no matter what you do to me! I won’t let you hurt Montana!” Scáthach declared.


        “Is that so? Well, what if I do this?” Laura turned and walked over to the unconscious teenagers on the ground. She grabbed one’s hair and pressed a dagger against his throat. The sharp blade cut his fragile skin with blood trickling down his neck.

        “What are you doing?!”  Scáthach stared at Laura in disbelief, her voice filled with rage.

        “Nothing much, just asking you to make a choice, either watch me kill this innocent boy to save Montana or hand over control to me. Which will you choose?” Laura replied coldly.

        “You! How could you do something like this?!”

        “Enough, just make your choice.”

        “I…”

        ‘She’s still hesitating. Looks like I’ll have to give her the final push.’ As Laura made up her mind, she raised the dagger and plunged it toward the teenage boy’s right arm—

        Clang!

        A bullet shot through the door, precisely knocking the dagger out of Laura’s hand. Clutching her tingling right hand, she looked toward the male machina standing at the door,

        “Kepler… Why are you always getting in my way?”

        “Getting in your way?!” Kepler, seething with anger, walked straight up to Laura despite his injuries. He forcefully grabbed her collar and growled distressingly, “Rule number two of the Agent’s Code: prioritize the safety of all innocent individuals! Everything you’re doing right now goes against the code. You’re committing a crime!”

        “These people would have been dead long ago if we didn’t risk our lives to save them. I’m simply asking them to return a favor to help us complete our mission, at the cost of a little injury,” Laura said with a smile, a nonchalant one as if she was talking about some mundane matters rather than the lives of others.

        “You—” Seeing Laura’s intolerably apathetic expression, Kepler released his grip and asked, “Last time, you went against the orders and acted on your own when there was no need to destroy the battlecruiser on the spot, resulting in the Guide’s escape. When will you learn from your mistakes?!”

        “You’re talking about Nuada,” Laura stated with unwavering conviction, “Don’t worry. I will capture him and send him to the other world where he will reunite with his battlecruiser— Argh!”

        Laura’s confident declaration was interrupted by an arrow made of elements. It came from the shadows with lightning speed, shooting through Laura’s core. Laura strenuously turned around only to meet a pair of blazing eyes—eyes belonging to a boy, the same boy mentioned in their conversation, Nuada.

        ‘Oh… It’s him… The hatred in his eyes… How familiar… This boy shares the same resentment as me…’ Laura thought as she slowly fell backward with a derisive smile tugging at the corner of her mouth…</p>
