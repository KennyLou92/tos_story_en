        <h1>Noble Confrontation - Nathaniel</h1>
        <p>
                In the past, Michael guided Nathaniel’s spirit and allowed him to reside within the runestones after he was defeated by Molly. Yet, in the strange land of illusions projected by the power of elements, where the past continued to be replayed, there seemed to be an alternative ending to his story…

        “I cannot accept this! How can you expand the war? By opening the source of chaos, you would simply necessitate more sacrifices!” Molly shouted.

        “We must bring lasting peace, not a temporary one!” Nathaniel explained.

        Standing before the Ocean of Gates, Nathaniel made up his mind to open the seal and enter the realm of gods to seek divine intervention. He believed that only through the gods’ power could the demons be completely expelled but Molly disagreed, and their disagreement soon led to a fight.

        As Molly raised her wand to cast a magic spell, Nathaniel unsheathed his sword and launched a series of ferocious attacks. The sorceress did not flinch but fought back valiantly. However, the two remain locked in a stalemate since none of them was able to kill their companion.

        “Being criticized for doing good is part of being a noble.”

        Suddenly, Nathaniel remembered his grandfather’s words as well as the teachings of his father and uncle. It was like a reminder to him that a nobleman sometimes might have to stake his reputation to achieve great things, and thus he must stick to his belief even if he was judged and accused.

        “Yeah, I came here because of those soldiers who believe in me and follow my steps! How could I give up my faith just because of the words of a friend?! I have to move forward and take the path that I believe in!”

        As soon as Nathaniel made a decision, he thrust his sword mercilessly and defeated Molly. Keeping his spirit up, he took down Lucifer with Endor and the reinforcements. Together they entered the realm of gods to see Zeus, the King of Gods.

        In the hall of the gods, Nathaniel stepped forward with his head held up high. He remained confident and unyielding even though he was standing in front of the formidable king of the gods. Looking straight into Zeus’eyes, he said aloud, “Your Majesty, I am Nathaniel. The evil demons have stormed our homeland and humiliated our people! That’s why we climbed up the tower and came here representing the humans to ask for your help to expel the abhorrent demons!”

        “Humans, I heard your plea. But we, the gods, shall never intervene in the wars of the other kinds.”

        “In the past, we humans have worshiped and defended the demons for you. We are the reason why you gods can still stay peacefully in the realm of gods today and enjoy the power of elements without actually doing anything! Yet, you choose to stand by and watch us humans suffer in such a time of war! You’re being insufferably selfish and despicable!”

        Sadly, Nathaniel’s vehement accusation fell on deaf ears. With a quick wave of the hand, Zeus simply used his godly power to evict Nathaniel from the hall of the gods and said in a deep tone, “Insolent mortal, leave!”

        Nevertheless, Nathaniel did not give up but continued to circulate among different godly factions proactively through the ages until he fell under the fallen angel’s manipulation and suffered severe punishment from the gods.　

        The battle between the gods and demons did reach an equilibrium with the interference of the angels. However, the angels only defended the gate to their home. While the lives of humans remained difficult, the aged Nathaniel—as the hero of humans—was imprisoned in the realm of gods, waiting for a warrior to end his eternal suffering one day…

        ‘Maybe I didn’t make the right decision but it is what I want. I will never regret whatever the future may bring me.’</p>
