        <h1>Aestus Radiance - Honor</h1>
        <p>
                Honor fell asleep under the holy flame.   Tulzscha’s power was churning in his body, as if the elements could sense his inner desire, thus forming a dream that allowed him to experience a different choice of life…

        Her horns and long eyelashes glowed with gold, with her hair hanging down to the red scales. Looking at the asleep demi-dragon maiden, a sense of warmth sent a ripple to Honor’s heart, who could not help but reach out towards her.

        “A gentleman shouldn’t do this! This is only the affection of the previous Dragon Spiritors, but not mine!” Honor turned his face away, doing his best to suppress the desires in his heart. He threw the Sword of Dracospirits on the mud ground angrily, trying to put aside the memories that were not his own. But when Honor met the face of the sleeping maiden again, he could not help imagining that he was lying in her arms...

        “Only by leaving her, I can get rid of this perplexity. I’ve fulfilled my mission to cut off the shackles of the dragon maiden and set her free. I guess it’s time to say goodbye.”

        Honor looked back at the maiden, imprinting her face in his mind before he left alone. While flying in the sky, the Sword of Dracospirits on his waist started vibrating, as if disagreeing to Honor’s decision. The leak of the holy flame made him pain; Honor changed his hand to hold the sword. As he gazed at the reflection, it seemed to reflect the appearance of the Dragon Spiritors of the past...

        “I love the glints of the sword!”
        “Mother…”
        “He’s dead. I am his successor, Toler.”
        “Don’t die that easily, okay?” A familiar female voice came to his ears.

        “Enough! Stop that! That’s not me!” Honor could not stand the gush of memories. Losing sanity to swing his sword, he flew out of control in the air, and eventually crashed into a tree and fell to the ground. When his consciousness was dim, he saw a red figure with dragon wings running towards him…

        “Ag...Agatha?”

        Sunlight came through the window. The color of the sky outside was reflected in Honor's eyes. He got up in a daze and found himself in a wooden house. A strange girl came to see Honor’s injuries, but his attention only focused on the dragon horns, red scales and dragon wings on the girl…“You are not Agatha. Who are you?” “I’m Magrence.”

        Magrence, who was also a demi-dragon, rescued Honor who had fainted in the woods and took him to the village for healing. She carefully bandaged his wound. When her dragon claws touched him, Honor subconsciously turned his face away. However, it was a surprise that his heart did not give him a great throb as expected. Confused, Honor looked at Magrence, whose scaly face did not evoke his urge to kiss. He felt at a loss for this unusually peaceful heart.

        Honor climbed over to grab the Sword of Dracospirits, which was placed on the edge of the bed. His heart was still calm, and the energy agitated in the past did not bring any emotional fluctuations. Fearing that his movements would make the wound even worse, Magrence stepped forward to help him get out of bed. Since then, Honor had been staying in the village for a while. Unfortunately, Magrence’s meticulous care did not result in Honor’s affection but only gratefulness...

        One day, the children in the village came to Magrence, clamoring to hear the story of the dragon. Magrence asked the children to sit around her; the children looked at her intently. This scene reminded Honor of the interaction with Agatha in the prison...and those memories that did not belong to him. The picture in front of him overlapped with the thoughts in his mind, as if the Dragon Spiritors of the past were the children sitting next to Agatha , listening to her teaching...

        “Look, Sister Magrence! I grew a new tooth!”
        “Sister Magrence! Hug me!”
        “Me too! My turn, my turn!”
        “Okay, one by one.” The children fought for favor around Magrence, while she smiled to fulfill their requests one by one. The youngest child couldn’t compete with others, so he hugged Magrence’s leg directly.
        “Little Po needs Sister Magrence’s spoiling again!”
        “Little Po, you’re my favorite kid.”
        “What about me!” “And me!”
        “Alright alright, no arguing. I love you all…”

        It came to Honor’s mind that he might now understand what Agatha's complicated gaze meant when she first looked at him. At that time, Agatha saw not only him, but all the Dragon Spiritors in the past, each of whom had a unique relationship with her, but she ended up enduring the parting of the loved ones. The interaction between Magrence and the children seemed to reflect the relationship between Agatha and the Dragon Spiritors. Agatha loves them, and they all loved Agatha…

        “As for me…”

        After Honor recuperated, it was the day for him to say goodbye to Magrence and the villagers. He thanked her for taking good care of him all along. With a smile, Magrence bid farewell, but never had she understood that she brought the Dragon Spiritor not just the healing favor, but a deeper enlightenment. Honor spread his silver wings; the light of the holy flame waved along with it. Eventually, he disappeared into the sky like a meteor in front of the villagers.

        “Although I run away, I still can’t deny my feelings for her. The throbbing in my heart proves that she is the eternal light that illuminates me.”</p>
