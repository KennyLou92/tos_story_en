        <h1>Scandalous Träumerei - Schumann</h1>
        <p>According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        From the moment of the Consonias’ birth, music had been everything to them; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        Schumann, dressed in an extravagant suit, walked into the backstage of the central performance hall at the Etna Grand Auditorium in the bustling capital, Groove. He admired himself in a full-length mirror, ensuring his attire was perfect until he heard the sound of music from the stage. 

        “It’s started!” He immediately turned and walked to the spot nearest the stage. He peered from the side to see the radiant stage that was about to come alive.

        On the stage was an orchestra that comprised around forty melodists, seated in a semicircle around a strikingly handsome gentleman standing on the conductor’s podium—Chopin. His countenance bore an air of sophistication, and there was an irresistible allure in his demeanor that drew people in, one that made others yearn to approach and understand him.

        He held his baton gracefully, leading the orchestra with quiet elegance. Under his direction, the melodist wove a tapestry of sound. Each section alternated seamlessly; different instruments harmonized, bringing out the essence of the composition. It was a remarkable performance that carried forward the composer’s vision, yet left space for the audience to interpret, drawing them into its depths, much like the composer himself.

        ‘Magnificent… Only Chopin could interpret such a profound masterpiece in this way…’ Schumann’s emotions began to surge controllably as a familiar exhilaration coursed through his body, just as it did every time Chopin’s gaze pierced through him.

        Schumann simply could not take his eyes off Chopin, utterly absorbed in the world he was creating, and he remained entranced even as the final note faded into silence. It was not until he saw Chopin walking backstage that he snapped out of the trance. Excited, he rushed forward to give Chopin a tight squeeze.

        “Bravo! Chopin, your performance was absolutely incredible!”

        “Thank you,” Chopin said as he returned Schumann’s embrace.

        “No, I should be the one thanking you. Your music has inspired me—I just thought of a concerto that might—”

        “Schumann, you’re next,” A low yet commanding voice interrupted Schumann’s excited rambling.

        “We’ll talk later,” Chopin said, releasing Schumann. He gave him an encouraging nudge, offering a gentle smile as he said, “Go, and give the best performance that you will never regret.”

        After flashing Chopin a bright smile, Schumann took a deep breath and stepped onto the conductor’s podium on the stage. When he turned to face the audience, he saw a single figure sitting in the middle—a stern and composed middle-aged man: Bach, the principal conductor of the Court of Music, and the arbiter of this crucial audition.

        The Court of Music had been searching for a new conductor for the Nocturne Orchestra since the official retirement of the previous leader the previous month. After rounds of evaluations and eliminations, the Court had narrowed down to two candidates: Chopin and Schumann, and this very audition would determine who would be the next conductor of the orchestra.

        Normally, Schumann should have felt nervous or anxious after just witnessing Chopin’s brilliant performance. However, he was rather calm, even excited—to be precise—as though he were about to partake in a thrilling game. 

        ‘Don’t fret. All I have to do is perform in my style, as I always have.’ Schumann made a formal bow to Bach, then turned to face the orchestra. He took out his baton and tapped his foot to set the tempo. ‘I know Maestro Bach prefers unpretentious and harmonious styles, but that’s not who I am. I’ll simply give my best performance, just as Chopin said.’

        As Schumann waved his baton, the orchestra followed his lead and played their instruments to bring his vision to life. The composition began with a series of innocent, childlike melodies, stitched together like fragments of a playful memory. As the piece evolved, it transitioned into a wistful lament, evoking a sense of nostalgia with the bittersweet ache of lost innocence. The rich emotions in the music unfolded like an intricate painting, revealing each detail to the audience in vivid strokes.

        Unlike Chopin’s refined and subtle style, Schumann’s style was bold and dynamic. Their performances were dramatically different yet equally compelling. It was impossible to say one was undeniably superior to the other; either of them would have made a worthy conductor.

        However, a decision had to be made.

        When Schumann’s performance ended, Bach dismissed the orchestra and stood before the two remaining candidates. It was after a moment of contemplation that he announced his decision, “...I hereby announce that Chopin will be the next conductor of the Nocturne Orchestra.”

        Bach turned to Schumann and said, “Schumann, while you are an excellent conductor yourself, you expressed the same passages with varying emotions and allowed the melodists too much freedom in their interpretations of the same sections. It did add depth to the emotions in the music, but it lacked the fundamental stability, which is something Chopin did better than you.” 

        “...I understand,” Schumann responded with a faint smile after a moment of silence. He then turned around and gently hugged Chopin, his voice sincere as he said, “Congratulations, my friend.”

        Although Schumann seemed unbothered by the result, he indeed felt a sharp pang of disappointment. 

        To distract himself from the disheartening reality, he decided to find his closest confidants. Yet luck was not on his side—they were either unavailable or out of town. Left with no other option, Schumann wandered into a nightclub to kill his time and drown his sorrows.

        While he drank alone, a beautiful woman suddenly approached him. Her face lit up with surprise as she said, “Mr. Schumann! What a coincidence to see you here!”

        “You are…” Schumann looked at the woman in confusion until her faintly familiar features stirred his memory—she was a student he had taught a few years ago. Then he exclaimed, “Oh my… It’s you, Vic! Look at you, you’ve grown so much over the past years…”

        ‘And you’ve become so beautiful…’ He murmured inwardly as his gaze lingered on her attractive face.

        “But you haven’t changed at all, Mr. Schumann,” Vic said with a soft laugh, her eyes brimming with admiration as she looked at him, “Just as handsome as ever.” The affection in her eyes somehow filled the aching void in Schumann’s heart, easing his pain. He found himself drawn to her youthful energy and warm presence. Before long, he became captivated by Vic’s charm and grace. Eventually, he succumbed to his desires and made an impulsive decision.

        However, every choice comes with a consequence.

        “Schumann, I’m pregnant.” Vic’s cheeks flushed as she delivered the news with joy. Yet, her words struck Schumann like a thunderbolt. He was not overjoyed; instead, he felt a wave of confusion, flustered by the sudden weight of responsibility that lay on his shoulders.

        Though reluctant, Schumann ultimately took responsibility and married Vic. He even severed ties with the friends with whom he had shared pleasure, keeping his distance from everyone lest a casual conversation triggered a bombardment of questions from his watchful wife.

        Ever since then, life was no longer colorful and vibrant for Schumann; all he felt was suffocation and regrets for his heart longed for freedom and diversity.

        The stifling marriage smothered his spirit and limited his creative soul. It did not take long for Paganini, the conductor of the Rhapsody Orchestra, to notice the change in him.

        One day, Paganini asked Schumann to stay behind after a rehearsal.

        “Schumann, I haven’t felt your passion and energy in your recent performances. What’s going on?”

        “I… I don’t even know where to begin… I feel trapped in an inescapable cage… ” Schumann first hesitated, but eventually, he opened up about his struggles with Vic. Torn by his growing despair, he murmured, “I desire love and freedom, but society has chained me to Vic. I don’t understand why my heart must be tied to just one person. Everyone is so beautiful—why can’t I love them all? Why must love be so selfish? I don’t understand… Was everything I believed about love nothing but a lie?”

        “This isn’t your fault, Schumann,” Paganini said as she lifted his chin with a finger, drawing him close until their breaths intertwined. Her gaze was intoxicating, filled with temptation. “Those people are wrong: they have bound themselves with rules. But you and I both know love, like music, should be boundless, with no restrictions. It’s them who put the definition of love in an unnecessary frame.”

        Paganini’s tantalizing whisper made Schumann’s pulse quicken, his breath thickening. A long-forgotten thrill awakened within him, and for the first time in ages, he felt alive.

        “Come, Schumann. Let me teach you what true love is.” Paganini chuckled, her voice like a siren’s call unraveling the last thread of his reason. Ultimately, overwhelmed by desire, he pulled Paganini onto the nearby sofa. Their skin pressed against each other as they unleashed the passion that had been suppressed for far too long…</p>
