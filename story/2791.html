        <h1>Resplendent Devotion - Aria</h1>
        <p>        In order to save Uther, Aria used the power of the holy grail to take the curse into her body. However, the curse was so powerful that even the holy grail could not reverse but only suppress it.

        Under the curse, Aria wandered in between consciousness and slumber from time to time. Thus, she moved to the sanctuary of the royal family and set up an enchantment so as to keep the power of the holy grail from unscrupulous and uninvited guests.

        Even though Aria rarely showed herself in front of the public, her heroic deed in saving Uther had made her the saintess in the kingdom. Throughout all these years, Aria learned to hide her emotions; the more so, the more she became accustomed to the cool and prestigious façade of being the saintess.

        Today was the wedding of King Uther and Aria was cordially asked to be the king’s officiant.

        As Aria watched Uther walk to her with someone’s hand in his, her hands were clenched so tight that they went white behind her back; still, she wore a placid and restrained smile on her face.

        ‘Today’s his wedding, I have to make it perfect.’

        “Your Holiness… Your Holiness?” Seeing the spaced-out Aria before the altar, Uther the groom gave her a gentle reminder with a smile.

        “Cough… Uther Pendragon, do you take her as your lawfully wedded wife? Do you promise to love and cherish her in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, for richer or poorer, for better for worse, through all the days of your life?”

        At that moment, every word Aria said hurt as if they were being engraved on her bones.

        “I do.” The unhesitant answer of Uther thrust into her heart like an invisible sword.

        Aria could hardly recall what happened next—the only thing she knew was that everyone was smiling so she followed, wearing a smile that was splendidly radiant as if she was hiding something. However, when someone talked to her, she just answered them like a puppet on a string.

        ‘Is it worth it?’ asked the holy grail in her body.
        ‘...It doesn’t matter, as long as he is happy.’
        ‘But what about you?’
        Aria didn’t answer, nor could she.

        After King Uther’s wedding, Aria just lived  blandly in despair as though she had lost all her sparks. It was only when she spied on Arthur with the magic mirror of water while she was awake would she feel a flicker of hope and smile.

        ‘He has recruited many knights. Everyone admires him.’
        ‘His wife gave birth to a girl. She looks very cute, just like him.’
        ‘He…is busy endorsing the documents. Look at him, all frowning. He hated reading the documents back then and he hasn’t changed.’

        Aria thought that these days would go on and she would see Uther age. Never would she have thought that one day she would be awakened by a stab of agonizing pain after years of slumber.

        ‘The curse has grown stronger! Something must have happened!’

        Racked with anxiety, Aria rushed out of the temple and hurried to the palace in spite of everything, only to find the entire palace engulfed by a miasma of black magic.

        Hiding her presence with magic, she went straight to Uther’s bedroom and saw a man— emaciated and scrawny—lying on the bed, who looked completely different from the tall and handsome Uther back in the days.

        Uther was shrouded in the black miasma which was exactly what aggravated the curse on him.

        Looking at Uther’s body contaminated by black magic, Aria—who had not shed a tear after becoming the saintess—broke down in tears which dripped on the face of the sleeping man.

        “I will not let you die! I will protect you no matter what.” As she held out her hand to caress his cheek tenderly, she washed away the black magic on him with the power of the holy grail.

        Yet, the black magic was much stronger than she had imagined. Even Aria used all her power, still, she could not remove all the black magic but only relieve his pain so that he could regain a slight consciousness.

        “Your… Holiness… Take the star stones and leave now… be-before they come back…” As Uther strenuously propped up himself, he took two star stones from a secret shelf beside his bed and put them into Aria’s hands.

        “Your Majesty, don’t you think it’s a bit too late?” A bewitching voice cut in Uther’s words.

        A ravishing woman slowly walked out of a dark corner. She was the wife of Accolon, King Uther’s younger brother—Morgan le Fay.

        “It’s you…” Aria glared at Morgan le Fay.

        “My son can never be the king as long as King Uther is still alive… Hand me the holy grail and I shall spare your life.”

        “Do you really think that I’ll believe you? You’ll kill us the either way… So, NEVER!” A powerful azure light blasted from Aria’s hand.

        Aria channeled all the magic power in her body for one attack—an extremely complicated magic circle appeared beneath her feet with a shivering chill that almost froze the space around her.

        “Everything. FREEZE. NOW!”

        A purple shield appeared before Morgan le Fay. Yet, she still moved a few steps back and hit the wall when the cold light struck against the shield. Just when her shield was about to be shattered——

        A blade flashed—Accolon, the husband of Morgan le Fay, made a stab right at Aria’s flank with a rapier.

        “Die!” Accolon growled with depravity and hatred written all over his face. Controlling the blue light with all her strength, Aria could hardly move so she could only watch as Accolon charged at her with the sword.

        However, someone stood before Aria—it was Uther, who was supposed to be lying on the bed. He threw himself in front of Aria to protect her, just like what he did on that day years ago.

        “Uther! …How dare you hurt him!” Aria’s intense emotions caused a surge in her power. With a great flash of icy light, she blasted Morgan le Fay and Accolon away while holding the fallen Uther in her arms.

        “Wh… Why…” Tears kept falling from Aria’s eyes like a burst dam.

        “Your Holiness? Why… would I feel so familiar seeing this… Oh… Right, now I remember…” Distant memories came flooding back to Uther’s mind, filling in for the loss of his life,.

        “Ha… You’re still such a crybaby… even after all these years.” Uther lifted his hand to wipe away the tears from Aria’s eyes. His words staggered Aria, who said, “You… You remember…”

        Responding her with a nod and a smile, Uther said breathlessly, “Now go… Aria… You can’t defeat them alone… Take the star stones with you…”

        “No! I will never leave you alone!”

        “Your Holiness… Don’t forget… your duty.”

        At that moment, the star stones in Aria’s arms felt like scorching stones.

        “This is my… last wish…”

        Gritting her teeth, Aria looked at the man imploringly as though she was engraving him on her mind. Then, she jumped out of the window and fled.

        “You can’t get away from us!” shouted Morgan le Fay.

        “Aria——” Uther should have something else in his last words; it could have been “I’m sorry” or “I love you”, yet Aria could never know the answer.

        With all her might, Aria fled to the sanctuary and built an extensive enchantment that covered everything around the temple.

        For the promise she had made, the saintess blessed by the holy grail shall wait here for someone who could be entrusted with the star stones…</p>
