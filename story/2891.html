        <h1>Vengeful Eclipse - Himiko</h1>
        <p>
                In the past, there once was a kingdom known as Yamatai. The kingdom perished one day under 
the invasion of a powerful country. However, Himiko, the queen of Yamatai and the only survivor of the massacre, revived her subjects by using a forbidden magic spell to reverse time. While she suffered from the magic’s backlash, Enoch the savior and Ingrid the great witch arrived at Yamatai on a mission and set off a chain of events. It was only until Jichen, a petrogon whom Himiko had encountered in the past, protected her with his life that the young queen had a moment of clarity and undid the time magic, allowing the deceased people of Yamatai to find their eternal peace.

        Still, the moment of spiritual awakening did not come without a price: Jichen’s Lumin was shattered while protecting Himiko, which left him terribly weakened. Thus, Himiko embarked on a journey with him to restore his broken Lumin.

        During the long journey, the wearied Himiko could not help but fall into a deep slumber where the elements created an illusory projection as if a means to soothe her wounded spirit, showing her the alternate reality where she made a different choice…

        There she was, back in the day when Yamatai was engulfed in the flames of war. Her servant, Isuzu, led her to a secret hideout made for the royal family.

        “Your Majesty, stay here, don’t open the door or make any sound before I’m back, okay?” said Isuzu.

        “Will-will you come back?” Himiko asked, her hands quivering uncontrollably as she grabbed Isuzu’s sleeves. Her round face reflected the profound vulnerability of a child; despite bearing the title of a princess, she was still a thirteen-year-old girl after all.

        “I will, I will come back for you, Your Majesty,” Isuzu promised with a smile as gentle as she always had been.

        However, she failed to keep her promise.

        Himiko waited for Isuzu for what seemed like an eternity, yet, Isuzu never returned. Eventually, she crawled out despite herself, only to witness the crumbling ruins of the palace and a kingdom strewn with corpses.

        “I don’t want to be alone...Give everyone back to me... I want everyone to stay with me happily forever…” Himiko, deeply shaken by the tragic reality, raised her hands and gathered her power. Yet, her mother’s words suddenly echoed in her ears—

        “Himy, we must not think of changing the past because it will only keep everyone trapped in agony. Only by moving forward can we break free from grief, and it is something you must understand as a leader.” Himiko still remembered the regal grace and wisdom her mother, Kasuga Sen, had shown her back then and the gentle brush on her hair.

        The memory jolted Himiko out of her trance of grief and despair.

        ‘Yeah, why am I losing myself again? I once lost to hatred, and now, I almost lost myself to grief,’ Himiko thought as she lowered her hands and surveyed her surroundings. ‘I can’t bring back the dead even if I reverse time. Casting the magic will only trap them in a stagnant world where time stops in a loop of grief and despair. How can I, as the queen of Yamatai, do such a thing to my people… But… That also means that I will be left alone… Living in solitude…’

        Himiko slumped to the ground as a sense of powerlessness weighed upon her chest. She gazed up at the sky where dark clouds gathered, mirroring her gloomy life.

        ‘This is too lonely… Perhaps it would be better if I follow everyone…’

        “Himiko!” A woman’s voice interrupted Himiko’s suicidal thoughts. An elegant bird transformed into a graceful woman as she descended from the sky. It was Feiyin, a featherette who had been saved by Kasuga Sen in the past, and thus forged a deep bond with Himiko.

        “Fei… Feiyin… Feiyin!” The searing pain of grief that Himiko had tried to suppress erupted within her like a blazing fire the moment she saw Feiyin. She scrambled to her feet, stumbling toward Feiyin like a lost child running to her mother. Just as she was about to tumble, Feiyin caught her and pulled her into a secure embrace.

        “Everyone… Everyone is gone… Feiyin… I’m the only one left… It hurts so much… Feiyin… My heart hurts…” Himiko choked out through tears.

        “I know… And now I’m here…” Feiyin’s embrace was so tight that Himiko struggled to breathe for a second, yet it brought her solace at the same time. Her frazzled spirit finally found a shelter, a place to rest, and her mind swiftly drifted into darkness…

        When Himiko opened her eyes, she found herself in the Deep Cloud Glen, a secluded valley where the featherettes resided. She climbed out of the bed and walked toward the door barefoot, only to hear the argument between Feiyin and a young man outside the room.

        “...You do have feelings for me, but why do you keep pushing me away?” the young man questioned loudly.

        “Huaxi, calm down. Give her a moment to explain,” a more composed male voice interrupted, talking some sense into the agitated Huaxi.

        “I…” Feiyin hesitated for a moment, “I… I’m not pushing you away. There are just more pressing matters that require my attention, so I cannot be with you, not now.”

        “I don’t get it!” Huaxi exclaimed in frustration. “It’s a simple yes-or-no question. What does ‘not now’ even mean— Argh!”

        Himiko forcefully pushed Huaxi away, trying to shield Feiyin with her petite frame. With her hands on her hips, she puffed her chest as she glared at him disapprovingly.

        “Stop bullying Feiyin!”

        “I didn’t bully—”

        “...Kiddo,” Jichen, Huaxi’s companion, showed a rare look of astonishment as he saw Himiko. The Yamatai princess, on the other hand, who seemed to recall something, stared at him as she murmured, “You’re that cocky guy…”

        “So you’re the princess of Yamatai… No wonder I couldn’t find you…”

        Jichen had met Himiko by coincidence during one of his visits to Yamatai back then. Himiko had stopped him from impulsively killing Huaxi when he was incited by his inner devil; she had saved him in a sense. Although he had attempted to see her again afterward, he had been unable to find her.

        After Feiyi told Jichen what had happened in Yamatai, he took it upon himself to take care of Himiko, relieving Feiyin’s burden so that she and Huaxi would not have to separate.

        Everything seemed to be getting better. Still, Himiko’s fear and guilt over her lost subjects lingered in her heart and eventually turned into a nightmare that haunted her at night…

        She found herself alone in the blood-splattered land of Yamatai, frantically wandering through the ruins. She kept running but never seemed to find a way out. In the moment of mounting panic, she saw someone—Iyo, her guard, drenched in blood with arrows piercing through her body.

        “Why… Why do you get to live so happily?” Iyo accused bitterly, staring with her right eye impaled by an arrow.

        “No… That’s not true…” Himiko, at a loss for words, helplessly shook her head. She ran away only to be stopped by another person—her servant, Isuzu.

        “We all died so tragically, and yet there you are, smiling. Have you already forgotten us?” Isuzu asked softly, her neck twisted at an unnatural and eerie angle.

        “NO!” Himiko shook her head vigorously and shouted, “No, I haven’t forgotten. I haven’t forgotten any of you!”

        The overwhelming emotional turmoil jolted Himiko awake from the nightmare. She sat up abruptly, gasping for breath. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she sobbed, huddling up like a wounded cub.

        ‘Yeah. How could I live happily when everyone died so unjustly and tragically?’ Himiko clenched her fists tightly, ‘I must avenge them, so their souls can find peace. It’s the least I can do for them.’

        And so, Himiko packed her belongings and quietly left the Deep Cloud Glen in the dead of night. She headed toward the powerful nation that had annihilated her kingdom, waiting for a chance to take vengeance.

        Coincidentally, the king of the powerful nation was holding a parade three days later, marking his successful conquest of another kingdom. The king would cruise around the nation with his troops during the celebration, an excellent chance for Himiko. It was as though fate decreed that she would have her revenge.

        On the day of the parade, Himiko lay in wait in the shadows after spending the past three days making her assassination plan. The king and his troops soon came as she expected. She peered through the crowd and looked at the sturdy man leading the group, the murderer of her parents. Fueled by the desire for vengeance, her magic became greater than ever as she compressed her power into multiple dark spheres.

        When the king arrived, Himiko dashed through the crowd. Her plan proved successful as it caught everyone off guard, allowing her to reach the king effortlessly. Gazing at the astonished king, she said with a triumphant smile, “Die.”

        At Himiko’s command, all the spheres flew toward the king, leaving multiple voids in his robust body. The king staggered backward and fell to the ground. A pool of blood slowly formed beneath him, eliciting horrified screams from the crowd.

        “Father!” a young man following the king screamed in terror. He recognized Himiko the moment he shot her an icy glare for vengeance, “You… You’re an escapee of Yamatai! Guards, seize her!”

        At the young man’s command, countless guards closed in on Himiko from all directions. Yet, she did not run for she had exhausted all her power on her last strike, knowing that she would not make it out alive from the moment she had planned her revenge. So, she closed her eyes, prepared to accept her inevitable fate.

        Unexpectedly, a dragon swiftly interposed between Himiko and the assailing guards, dispelling her enemies with a swing of his tail. 

        “Jichen!”

        “Found you at last, kiddo. You sure know how to run,” Jichen grinned, “Everyone’s been waiting for you to come home.”

        “I killed their king; they will not spare me,” Himiko said.

        “Hmm, have you forgotten?” Jichen showed no sign of fear despite knowing that he was about to make enemies of a powerful nation. Gazing at the fragile little girl, Himiko, he said, “I’m the strongest; there’s nothing I can’t do.”

        He then gently touched his chest where a glowing magic circle appeared. Through the circle,  a crystalline sphere materialized, bright yet marred by several cracks—it was Jichen’s Lumin.

        “No… Stop…” Himiko, realizing that Jichen intended to use forbidden magic, put out a hand to stop him, but he avoided her and resolutely crushed his cracked Lumin.

        “I will save you, no matter how.”

        A burst of dazzling light enveloped Jichen. With his power temporarily amplified at the cost of his Lumin, he broke through the guards’ siege like a strong gust of wind. Still, it was impossible for him to avoid all heavy blows with the odds against such a large number of enemies. Fortunately, he managed to take Himiko back to the Deep Cloud Glen while he had one breath left.

        Feiyin and Huaxi came to their rescue and saved Jichen’s life as soon as they learned of the news. With his Lumin shattered, however, Jichen lost all his powers; he could no longer take on a human form, nor could he speak, and hence he afterward embarked on a journey with Himiko, searching for a cure for his broken Lumin…

        “I may regret it in the future, but I still want everyone to stay by my side even if it is just a mere illusion.”</p>
