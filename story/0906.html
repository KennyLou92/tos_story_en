        <p>
                “I’m Jing Tian.  My reputation precedes me...” 

        As a reincarnation of Fei Peng the mighty general, Jing Tian had hoped to easily be the best Sword Saint of his generation, enjoying the respect of all and earning a fortune.  Later, the appearance of Chong Lou prompted him on his journey.  Not only did he learn about his previous life, but he also prompted a continuation of the fated links between himself, Chong Lou and Long Kui.  The wheels of fate has started spinning.</p>
