        <h1>Undeadly Allure - Lin Daiyu</h1>
        <p>        On the tranquil and remote mountainside, there was a simple wooden cottage nestled amidst lush greenery.

        What was particularly fascinating about the cottage was that there was no bed in the largest bedroom but a large rectangular wooden box, which was now open.

        Crafted from beautiful cedar wood, the box was long and narrow, providing just enough space for a person to lie down comfortably. Its sides were adorned with reddish-golden frames, displaying a subtle sense of nobility and grace that accentuated the youthful beauty of the girl reclining within.

        However, it would have been an even more breathtaking picture if there was not a string of drool hanging from the corner of the girl’s mouth. Nonetheless, the slumbering girl seemed unperturbed by her inelegant appearance. She continued to sleep soundly until some hurried footsteps jolted her awake.

        “Daiyu! Daiyu! I’ve made breakfast, wake up!” A boy of around ten years old rushed into the room. He had a face that was even more delicate and beautiful than the girl’s, yet his physique seemed slightly frail, perhaps due to malnutrition.

        “...Shut up… Go away…” Unwilling to awake from her slumber, the girl, Lin Daiyu, buried her head deep into her pillow. However, the boy refused to let her sleep in peace. With a nimble leap, he jumped directly into the box, straddling the girl, and shouted at the top of his lungs, “No! The sun is up and it’s time to rise and shine! You can’t sleep the day away!”

        “...Ahh! You’re driving me crazy!” The boy’s jump swept Lin Daiyu’s drowsiness away. Irritated, she flipped the boy over, sending him tumbling to the ground. But rather than getting upset, the boy beamed with a radiant smile and happily said, “Daiyu, you’re finally awake”

        “Xiao Jia, how many times do I have to tell you? Don’t call me Daiyu, call me Master!”

        “No! Daiyu is Daiyu!” Xiao Jia vehemently retorted. However, fearing Daiyu’s anger, he quickly added, “I’ll go and bring breakfast to the table!”

        “Wait—” Lin Daiyu watched as Xiao Jia cleverly dashed out of the room. She rubbed her forehead in frustration and sighed, “Why did I keep him in the first place… All I wanted was to quietly escape from the arranged marriage and find solace here...”

        Lin Daiyu was a Fu Yuan demon. Different from other demons, the Fu Yuan demons had a unique flow of elemental energy within their bodies, which caused stagnation at the joints and resulted in stiff movements. Nevertheless, the biological inheritance gave Lin Daiyu immense power, allowing her to channel her energy into specially crafted talismans and cast various powerful spells.

        As a scion of a prestigious family within the Fu Yuan demon clan, Lin Daiyu possessed extraordinary talent in the art of talismans. Her mastery and cultivation in the field garnered high expectations from her elders, and to pass down this exceptional talent, her family had arranged her marriage without her consent.

        To escape the unwanted betrothal, Lin Daiyu fled her hometown overnight, hiding in a sparsely populated mountain. There, she lived a languorous life, indulging in leisurely slumber until one day, overcome by hunger, she ventured out in search of food. It was then that she stumbled upon a famished little boy, Xiao Jia, who had collapsed from starvation.

        Seeing the boy’s frail physique and his countenance which resembled a man of her acquaintance, Lin Daiyu felt pity and decided to take care of him temporarily. Although she intended to send him back home once he woke up, the boy persistently badgered her to keep him with her, claiming to have nowhere else to go. Unable to resist his tearful pleas, Lin Daiyu reluctantly agreed to take him in, thus putting an end to her days of leisurely sleep-ins.

        Lin Daiyu, who regretted her decision every morning, sighed in resignation as she rubbed the back of her head. She then walked out into the living room where two plates of sumptuous breakfast had been laid out on the table. The dissatisfaction in her heart slightly diminished at the sight of the delectable meal.

        “Although I still hate waking up early in the morning…”  Lin Daiyu sat on a chair, picked up a bowl of creamy vegetable porridge, and sighed while gulping it down, “with the delicious food and spotless house, I suppose it’s worth it.”

        After a satisfying meal, Lin Daiyu reclined on the chair, observing Xiao Jia diligently washing the dishes in the kitchen. Surprisingly, she felt a twinge of guilt for her indulgent and lazy behavior over the past few weeks.

        “Sigh, perhaps it’s time to do something productive after resting for so long.” Lin Daiyu stretched lazily, returned to her room, and changed into an outdoor outfit with several small pouches tied around her waist. She then walked out of her room and coincidentally bumped into Xiao Jia, who had just finished tidying the house. The boy’s expression froze for a moment at the sight of the completely different Lin Daiyu.

        “Daiyu… Are you sick? What’s with that energetic look—ouch!” Xiao Jia let out a cry of pain as Lin Daiyu flicked his forehead.

        “I’m not sick! Don’t jinx my health,” said Lin Daiyu crossing her arms in front of her chest, pouting with a hint of inexplicable coquettishness. “I’m going out for some business. If you don’t see me back home in seven days, take the money from the drawer in my room and live on your own.”

        “Why won’t you come back? Are you going to do something dangerous? Then I want to go with you!” Xiao Jia protested.

        “This is none of your concern. Just stay here and behave yourself.” Lin Daiyu replied sternly, dismissing his request. 

        “But…”

        “No one likes a nosy kid. Just take care of yourself, got it?” Paying no further attention to Xiao Jia, Lin Daiyu walked outside. She then bit her finger and drew two talismans with her blood, placing them on her feet.

        In an instant, the talismans burned into ash. Yet, the blood sigil remained in the air, hovering on Lin Daiyu’s legs like two rings while a bright light flashed across it. Then, she kicked off and soared into the sky effortlessly as if weightless, disappearing before Xiao Jia’s eyes.

        Lin Daiyu transformed into a gust of wind, traversing mountains and water, surmounting dense forests until she arrived at a desolate wasteland where seven stone pillars stood upright on the barren land, forming a mysterious yet harmonious pattern.

        “This is it, the entrance of the secret realm left by a past Fu Yuan demon,” Lin Daiyu whispered as she landed in front of the stone pillars, cautiously surveying her surroundings.

        The Fu Yuan demon clan had produced numerous renowned masters of talisman art in the past. To preserve their profound knowledge after their deaths, the masters stored their treasures and techniques within boundaries they called the secret realms. The secret realms opened periodically, with multiple challenging traps and tests designed to select worthy individuals as the heirs to the legacy hidden within.

        Lin Daiyu had always been enthusiastic about challenging the secret realms of different experts, so of course, she would not miss the opportunity. She clenched her fists, brimming with determination, and stepped into the swirling dark vortex at the center of the stone pillars. In an instant, she was teleported to a picturesque paradise, filled with the fragrance of flowers and the songs of birds.

        “This time, I will break my record in conquering a secret realm!”Lin Daiyu declared with unwavering confidence. However, her confidence was soon shattered when she realized that the challenges here were based on the art of Qimen Dunjia, the mysterious gates escape technique, a skill she was least proficient in.

        “Oh, come one! How did I end up back at the starting point again?” After circling back to the entrance for the eighteenth time, Lin Daiyu finally snapped. She fell onto the ground, gazing helplessly at the sky, where colorful birds freely soared. “Sigh, I’m so hungry. Now I wish Xiao Jia were here. Then he would make me some delicious grilled meat—”

        “I didn’t make grilled meat, but I made grilled fish. Do you want some?” a familiar voice replied, causing Lin Daiyu’s nerves to twitch. She sprang up and turned around, staring in disbelief at Xiao Jia, who held a grilled fish in his hand. 

        She stuttered in her astonishment, “Yo-yo-you…how did you come here?”

        “I-I was worried about you, so I followed you,”  Xiao Jia stammered in reply.

        “You…”  There were so many things Lin Daiyu wanted to say, but she did not know where to begin. In the end, she could only ask the most important question. “Are you out of your mind? Once you enter the secret realm, you can’t leave unless you solve the challenges!”

        “Well, this seems like a nice place to stay. There is abundant food, and there’s a beautiful mansion for us to sleep in,” Xiao Jia said nonchalantly.

        “That’s not the point…” Lin Daiyu’s words trailed off as she suddenly stopped, anxiously stepping forward and grabbing Xiao Jia’s shoulders.  She brought her beautiful face close to his, so close that their eyelashes almost touched. The unexpected proximity made Xiao Jia’s entire face blush, as if it were set ablaze.

        However, Lin Daiyu failed to notice Xiao Jia’s unusual reaction as she exclaimed, “You found a mansion!? Where is it?”

        “Huh?”

        “Don’t ‘huh’ me. That mansion is the key to conquering the secret realm! Just take me there, now!” As Lin Daiyu took a step back, the distance from her intense gaze allowed Xiao Jia to clear up his thoughts. He led her through a dense forest and lakes and soon arrived at an elegant historic mansion.

        “How did this little guy find this mansion? Is he hiding something—” Lin Daiyu's suspicions arose as she observed Xiao Jia’s decisive actions, but her train of thought was interrupted by a sudden dark shadow.

        A person-sized falcon swooped down, directly targeting Xiao Jia.

        “Whoa!”

        “Duck!” Lin Daiyu shouted, hastily retrieving a talisman and infusing it with her power. Several wind blades materialized out of thin air, slicing through the falcon and reducing it to pieces. The torn talisman scattered onto the ground.

        With a thud, Xiao Jia threw himself into Lin Daiyu’s arms, burying his face in her chest, trembling uncontrollably.

        “Daiyu, Daiyu… Boohoo… I’m scared,” Xiao Jia whimpered.

        “Uh… There, there. I’ll protect you,”  Lin Daiyu reassured Xiao Jia, gently patting his back to comfort him, while she thought, ‘He’s just a child. How could he possibly hide something? It must have been a stroke of luck that he found the mansion.’

        “Let’s go inside the mansion. Just stay close to me,” Lin Daiyu cautioned. Fully aware of the dangers ahead, Xiao Jia responded with a vigorous nod and firmly held onto the hem of Lin Daiyu‘s clothes, which softened her heart even more.

        Along the way, they encountered numerous ambushes and challenges, but with Lin Daiyu’s talismanic skills and Xiao Jia’s quick thinking, they overcame each one, finally reaching the central hall of the mansion.

        The hall was vast and empty, devoid of any furniture except for a treasure chest placed in the center, clearly tempting any treasure seekers to approach. Although it could be a trap, Lin Daiyu’s desire for the treasure compelled her to take the risk.

        “Wait here for me. Don’t move,” Lin Daiyu instructed Xiao Jia.

        Xiao Jia obediently nodded and stayed in place, watching as Lin Daiyu approached the treasure chest step by step. Suddenly, he caught a faint ominous sound. His eyes squinted and widened in alarm, shouting, “Daiyu! Watch out! Behind you!”

        “What?!” Lin Daiyu swiftly turned around but it was already too late—

        Two emerald green talismans suddenly appeared, rapidly disintegrating into ash, and reassembled into two green giants twice the size of Lin Daiyu!

        “This… This is an advanced invocation talisman!” Lin Daiyu exclaimed in astonishment. She quickly took out a talisman and summoned an elemental shield to protect herself, but it was not enough to completely block the green giant’s powerful blow.  She was sent flying toward a wall, crashing into it before sliding down.

        The two green giants did not give her a moment to catch her breath. They charged toward Lin Daiyu once again, raising their massive fists. However, before they could land their punches, a dark figure appeared, swiftly scooping up Lin Daiyu and leaping away.

        Boom! The green giants’ fists slammed into the wall and the ground, raising a cloud of dust that momentarily obscured the surroundings. Yet, it also gave Lin Daiyu a moment to see the face of the person who had saved her. It was a tall and graceful man, possessing features that surpassed those of a woman. Every aspect of his face looked so unforgettably familiar to Lin Daiyu.

        “Xiao-Xiao Jia! Wh-why are you suddenly all grown up?!” Lin Daiyu exclaimed in surprise. But soon, her eyes widened as she realized the truth, and she said, “No… You’re Da Yu! So you’ve been pretending to be Xiao Jia all along?”

        Some days ago, Lin Daiyu ventured into a snowy secret realm. There, she met a man who was actually the grown-up version of Xiao Jia. Together they overcame the challenges of the secret realm and found the hidden treasure. With a bond formed during their journey, they agreed to meet again when the next secret realm opened. However, an unexpected betrothal befell Lin Daiyu soon after she returned home. In her discontent, she ran away from her hometown and hid for a while before she entered this secret realm.

        Xiao Jia, who had transformed into an adult, landed in front of another wall, gently placing Lin Daiyu down. He interrupted her eager inquiries and took out a talisman, his expression turning serious, and he said, “I’ll explain it later. Let’s deal with our enemies first.”

        Lin Daiyu had no choice but to suppress her inner doubts. Together with Xiaojia, she fought against the green giants. Their movements were perfectly synchronized. Having spent some time living together, they had developed a remarkable synergy, and with their combined efforts, they finally managed to defeat their enemies.

        It was then that Lin Daiyu could finally relax her tense nerves. She looked at Xiao Jia with a complex gaze, realizing that he had protected her multiple times during the battle. Seeing the numerous wounds on his body made it impossible for her to put up a tough front. Her heart pounded uncontrollably as she stared at him, so she turned her face away and awkwardly asked, “Who are you?”

        “My name is Jia Baoyu,” the man answered, looking at Lin Daiyu with an amused smile spreading across his beautiful face.

        “Jia Baoyu…” Lin Daiyu felt like she had heard that name somewhere before. She tilted her head and placed her fingers on both sides of her temples, trying to evoke her recollection. Then, she suddenly straightened her neck, pointing her index finger at Jia Baoyu in surprise, she shouted, “Oh! You are my arranged husband— Mm!”

        Jia Baoyu wrapped his hand around Lin Daiyu’s pointing finger. The sudden warmth and intimacy she felt made her experience a rare sense of shyness. Jia Baoyu’s smile deepened, and he spoke even more gently, “Yes, I am your arranged husband.”

        “Bu-but why did you stay with me?” Lin Daiyu asked.

        “I was going to cancel our betrothal, but I changed my mind after I found it was you,” Jia Baoyu said, gazing deeply into her eyes. “And I’m glad I did. I’m very happy that you are my soon-to-be wife...”

        “But… I’m lazy, bad-tempered, and I don’t even know how to cook. I’m not wife material!” Lin Daiyu mumbled, her voice filled with self-doubt, unaware that by saying so, she secretly hoped for him to deny it.

        “No, you’re kinder and lovelier than I imagined. I like you a lot. As for cooking, we know I can take care of that,” Jia Baoyu said, holding both of Lin Daiyu’s hands, looking at her dotingly. “We can live together just like before, for the rest of our lives.”

        “I-I-I—” Lin Daiyu’s heart raced rapidly as he looked into Jia Baoyu’s tender and affectionate eyes. Uncontrollably, she began to imagine their life together, and to her surprise, she found it rather sweet than repulsive.

        However, the feeling was so overwhelming that it seemed to have gone beyond Lin Daiyu’s knowledge, compelling her to defend herself. She abruptly pulled her hands away and nervously stepped back. A smokingly fiery blush rose to her face as she stuttered, “I-I got something else to do. You can keep the treasure!”

        Then, she took out a talisman and vanished into thin air before Jia Baoyu could react. Jia Baoyu stood there in a daze for a moment before he burst into laughter, a hearty and amused laughter, while looking in the direction where Lin Daiyu disappeared.

        “I will find you, and I won’t let you run away again, my beloved fiancée!” he whispered with determination.</p>
