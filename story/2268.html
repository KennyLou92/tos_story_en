        <h1>Destined Tragedy - Cai Wenji</h1>
        <p>        “Cao Cao must die today.”

        Sitting in the lounge, Cai Wenji took a sip of  tea then heaved a breath.

        As the door opened, a man stepped into the room. Once he entered, Cao Cao said to Cai Wenji, “so you summoned me for important business. Are you trying to make a deal with me again?”

        “Stop blabbing. The emperor granted me the permission to go back home for tomb-sweeping. I only summoned you because we’re from the same town. Don’t think too much,” said Cai Wenji, who was afraid that Cao Cao might spill their secret meeting.

        “Take a look at this list and see if anything is missing,” said Cai Wenji, who waved her hand. Then a maid-disguised assassin handed a document to Cao Cao.

        Cai Wenji tried to make Cao Cao drop his guard by a small talk. So, she brought up their childhood memory, “I still remember that you hated animal fur when you were small, so I didn’t add any exotic fur into the list.”

        “Oh, that was ancient,” said Cao Cao. He took the list and continued, “mmm...The emperor is generous this time. You really are his favourite.”

        Cao Cao’s attention was all on the list, who seemingly failed to notice the assassin standing behind him. As Cai Wenji signalled, the assassin quickly pulled out a dagger trying to stab him in the back.

        Clang! The dagger was unable to thrust into Cao Cao’s body.

        At this moment, Cao Cao grasped the assassin’s neck as if he had already predicted the assassination. Clack! The assassin’s neck was snapped.

        “What?...Go! Go to him at once!” As the assassination failed, Cai Wenji commanded the remaining assassins to finish the plan, but none of them responded.

        “Didn’t expect that I would wear a protective vest inside? You have no idea how many times people tried to kill me. And you really believed that your sloppy plan could kill me,” said Cao Cao in laughter, tossing the dead assassin away

        Startled by the slowly approaching Cao Cao, Cai Wenji ran towards the screen and tried to flee the scene.

        “Don’t come any closer!” Cai Wenji, too frightened to run, stumbled onto the floor and began to crawl.

        “Master, all assassins have been eliminated.”

        The voice came from a girl with an eye patch, who dragged the quivering emperor out of the screen.

        “My lord!” 

        Cai Wenji had never expected that Cao Cao would be capable of killing all the assassins she had planted.

        “Cao Cao, how dare you! Let go of me,” the frightened emperor yelled.

        “HAHAHAHA! Do you know the ending of those who tried to kill me?” Cao Cao came to the subdued emperor and the crawling Cai Wenji. He continued, “Dong Zhuo got his henchmen killed when he tried to frame me. Then he came to my mansion to ask for an apology. Do you know what happened next?”

        “He got pierced by a sword and pinned dead on a pillar,” Cao Cao said next to the emperor, who was already terrified to speechless.

        “Anyone who tried to hurt me will pay the price, including the emperor!”

        With a clean slash, Cao Cao slitted the emperor’s throat.

        “No! I can’t believe you just did it! This is treason!” Cai Wenji exclaimed.

        “You’re wrong. I’m not the treason one. Dong Zhuo’s conspirator did that,” said Cao Cao with the gaze of bloodlust. 

        “Somebody help! The emperor got assassinated! Arrest the assassin!”

        Cai Wenji became utterly devastated and passed out at the moment when Cao Cao shouted for help.

        “Mmm...Where am I…” When Cai Wenji regained consciousness, she was locked up in a damp dungeon already.

        “You’re awake,” said Cao Cao, holding a slumbering baby in front of the jail cell.

        “Cao Cao you traitor! Let go of my son!”

        Cai Wenji collapsed when she saw her son was in her nemesis’s arms. She reached out of the cell as far as she could, trying to take her son back.

        “Relax,” Cao Cao teased while stroking the infant’s cheek.

        “Please, for the sake of our friendship, spare him. He’s innocent. Take everything out on me…” the devastated Cai Wenji wept.

        “Speaking of which, his father is gone. What a shame. Hey little one, do you wanna see your father?” The grinning Cao Cao asked. With the drug effect, the baby remained asleep.

        “NO! I’ll do anything as you said! Please!” Cai Wenji had a mental breakdown.

        Cao Cao tilted her chin and said, “you should be thankful to the little one. If he means nothing to you, it’ll be useless for me to keep you alive. Now that I know he means the world to you, I’ll keep you alive and make you suffer the rest of your life without your beloved one.”

        “NO! Please spare Xie! I’m begging you! Cao Cao, I’M BEGGING YOU!”

        No matter how loud Cai Wenji had scream, Cao Cao never slowed down his steps.

        As Cao Cao left, the wet gloomy dungeon had nothing left but the echoes of devastated cry.
