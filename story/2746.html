        <h1>Illustrious Laurels - Arthur</h1>
        <p>Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.7

        A light of sword shone. Arthur ran desperately and reach out her hand to stop it, but she was still too late that she could only watch the sword pierce through Lancelot’s body——

        ‘Nooooo——!’ She panted breathlessly. Her chest rose and fall in abrupt undulations. As she opened her eyes, she saw an ashen ceiling.

        Arthur got up and looked around this unfamiliar and quiet room. Then she saw the perturbed eyes of Bedivere so she said ardently, ‘Bedivere! Did you save us? Where’s everybody? Has Lancelot regained his consciousness yet?’

        Seeing  Bedivere’s complex expression and hesitation in speaking, Arthur recalled that Bedivere told her the truth under this kind of sullen silence before they got separated. Thus, she became nervous. ‘Just tell me! I’m not a kid anymore. And my friends matter to me!’

        Since Bedivere told her the whole story, Arthur immediately said, ‘I’m going to the palace and fight with everyone.’

        ‘But you’re seriously wounded——’
        ‘I can’t let everybody take the risk for me! Only I can draw out the Excalibur and stop Mordred!’

        Arthur looked at Bedivere straight in the eye, showing no trace of fear. After a while, Bedivere gave up. She took the equipment and handed the Star Stone left by Merlin to Arthur, said, ‘Arthur, stick to your father’s will of protecting everything. Use this power and bring changes to this country!’ 

✽

        In the palace hall.

        A man was clasped by a giant monster. His face was bluish because of suffocation. He seemed to be out of breath. Suddenly, an enormous shadow appeared before the right window. A sharp noise of broken glass came before the monster could ever react. Then a violent force kicked it to the other wall, creating a deep hole.

        The man who was clamped just now fell onto the ground and choked because of rapid breathing. Then someone held him up and called his name worriedly, ‘Lancelot!’

        ‘Cough… You’re late, monkey.’ Even though he looked piteous, Lancelot still teased Arthur as he always did

        ‘You… Stop calling me monkey!’ Despite the unforgiving words coming from Arthur’s mouth, her eyes were already filled with tears since she knew the Lancelot she used to know was back.

        Standing aside, Bedivere watched the two’s interaction with a smile. However, it soon turned into a stiff smile as she felt an immense hint of menace approach, which left her no time to warn the two but only stand in front of Arthur and block it.

        Mordred, who had turned into a moster, abruptly rushed over and swung his sturdy arm at Bedivere, knocking her into the air like a weightless doll.

        ‘Bedivere!’ Arthur dashed to catch Bedivere, only to see her pale face, dazed eyes and blood dripping from the corner of her mouth.

        ‘I-I’m fine… Arugh!’ Still, Bedivere was seriously injured that she passed out. Just then, Mordred came again but failed as Lancelot stopped him with his sword.

        However, the difference in power was too great. Seeing that Lancelot was being suppressed, Arthur got frantic.

        “If this goes on like this, Lancelot will be defeated. Is there any way we can take him down...”

        Just as Arthur was racking her brain for a solution, the door was suddenly opened. Two people, one tall and one short, broke in. The short one-Tristan waved his hand with prismatic light shining at his fingertips and yelled, ‘Arthur! The last Star Stone is here!’

        The Excalibur hanging on Mordred’s waist kept shaking and shimmering as if it had sensed something. Arthur didn’t miss the opportunity. She put down Bedivere, raised her right arm and yelled, ‘Excalibur, come to me!’

        With a swish, the Excalibur got away from Mordred and flew to Arthur.

        ‘No! Th-that’s my sword!’ Mordred wanted to chase after but he was stopped by Lancelot.

        Meanwhile, a light glowed on Tristan, Lancelot and Arthur. As the five Star Stones on them turned into streams of light, they darted towards the Excalibur and filled the five holes on the scabbard. Embedded on the scabbard, the Star Stones shone in five colors.

        Arthur slightly pushed open the sheath. Upon the blade’s first reveal, it released a blinding and dazzling light, which was so hallowed that brought people in awe. Under the bright silver light, Arthur drew out the Excalibur completely and raised it to the air!

        ‘That’s mine! I AM the destined king!’ Regardless of his bleeding wounds, the monstrous Mordred shoved Lancelot aside and hurtled towards Arthur with black flames conjuring on his hand and red veins standing out on his hideous eyes.

        ‘You are not the king and you never will be!’ Arthur spoke every word loud and clear, staring at Mordred’s chest. As she found the vile core hidden inside, she immediately swayed her right arm and stabbed at it——the Excalibur hit the vile core right in the middle. The vile core then broke into pieces, turned into dust and disappeared into the air along with the wind.

        Losing the protection of his black magic, Mordred slowly turned back to his human form. The backlash of magic sapped all his strength and power. Like a wilted plant, he knelt in front of Arthur, eyes wide opened with reluctance, murmuring, ‘No way, I’m the real——’

        Unfortunately, he had his last breath before he could finish his last word.

        ‘We… w-we did it!’ Raising a loud cheer, Tristan hugged Lamorak. As if they were attracted by his cheers, Merlin, Galahad, Gareth, Guinevere and Gawain came to the palace hall one after another. Everyone was full of joy, except Arthur, who was still at a loss.
　　
        A breeze of wind came and gently stroke her hair as if it sensed her confusion.  Realizing something, Arthur looked up at the throne, where a reflection of light shone and formed a holy halo.

        Arthur took a step as if she was lured. She climbed up the stairs step by step, cautiously and earnestly, walked to the back of the throne and knelt. Then she finally had a clear sight of the spot where the light landed. There was a line of elegant handwriting craved on it. 
　　
        ——Power is meant to serve and protect others. King Uther
　　
        An inexplicable feeling boiled over in Arthur’s heart, which eventually turned into tears and rolled down from her virescent eyes. She reached her hand and caressed those words. Leaning her head devoutly on it, she whispered softly, ‘Father, I will always keep your teachings in mind.’</p>
