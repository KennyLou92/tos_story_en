        <h1>Thrill-seeking Criminologist - Cox</h1>
        <p>
                The story starts in a luxurious hotel nestled in the center of a city in Verdilles, a kingdom located in the western Tarones.

        Cox, a male demon, gathered up his belongings and took the elevator to the lobby to check out of his room at the front desk. When he stepped out of the elevator, a loud voice came from the side, shouting, “Woah! Watch out!” He turned around only to see a young man chasing after an overloaded luggage cart that was careening toward him.

        Arching an eyebrow, Cox extended his hands and steadied the cart. The young man breathed a sigh of relief as he regained his grip on the cart’s handle. With a timid smile, he said to Cox, “Thank you.”

        “No need to thank me, but please don’t let it happen again. It wouldn’t be a minor accident if it were a child standing in my place.”

        “I-I’m so sorry! I promise it won’t happen again!” The young man remorsefully apologized. It was after watching the young man carefully push the luggage cart into the elevator that Cox continued walking to the front desk. After completing the check-out procedure, Cox picked up his suitcase and headed toward the exit.

        “The weather is lovely today,” Cox stood in front of the hotel’s entrance, admiring the sunny blue skies. However, the smile on his face soon turned into a look of astonishment, “Huh? What is that?”

        He saw a minuscule black dot in the sky which rapidly grew in size at an alarming speed. In the blink of an eye, someone crashed thunderously on the ground right next to him—a beautiful young girl who now became a twisted fractured doll under the impact.

        “Ahhhhhhhhh!” 
        “Someone jumped from the building!”
        “C-call the police, QUICK!”

        The girl’s fall caused a dreadful commotion among the pedestrians. While everyone was plunged into a panic, either screaming or running, Cox, who stood at the center of the scene, remained calm, gazing thoughtfully at the girl’s lifeless body on the road.

        “Oh dear, such a troubling incident,” Cox put a hand on his wrinkled forehead as he sighed, not out of sorrow for the life lost, but rather out of his annoyance over how this event disrupted his plans.

        Before long, a middle-aged detective inspector arrived with a team of police officers. They swiftly took control of the crime scene and conducted a full investigation throughout the hotel with all witnesses and suspects gathered in the lobby. Cox, as one of the witnesses, was directed to wait in a corner of the lobby, but as time passed, no police came to take a statement from him.

        Taking a glance at the clock, Cox decisively rose from his seat after pondering for a brief second and walked to the center of the lobby where the detective inspector was surrounded by his subordinates.

        “Excuse me, officer, how much longer do we need to stay here? I have an important ceremony to attend…”

        “Who is this guy?” The detective inspector, Lestrade, turned to one of the officers beside him instead of answering Cox’s question. 

        “So, you’re that unlucky fellow who nearly got squashed by that idol,” Lestrade sneered insolently after the officer whispered the details in his ear. “No one is going anywhere until we find the murderer.”

        “Is it because the deceased was Carly, a member of the currently popular idol group?” Cox asked with a smirk.

        Lestrade’s face darkened upon hearing Cox’s words, his gaze sharpened as he looked at Cox sternly.

        “I don’t know where you got this information from, but I advise you to mind your own business and keep your nose where it belongs. We don’t need a layman like you to teach us how to do our job,” Lestrade warned. 

        “A layman?” Cox repeated, somewhat amused. He took an invitation out of his pocket and showed it to Lestrade. He said, “I’m afraid you are the true laymen when it comes to solving a crime.”

        “That is… a royal invitation?” Lestrade’s face immediately paled as he saw the letter, “So, you’re Mr. Cox, one of the distinguished detectives that have received the King’s invitation…”

        “That’s correct. Nice to meet you,” Cox replied.

        “Cough… Please forgive me for my imprudence. Unfortunately, we don’t need your help with this case, Mr. Cox, because we have already narrowed it down to three suspects. We will be interrogating them one by one and will soon uncover the culprit,” Lestrade declared with great confidence.

        “That’s excellent news,” Cox clapped his hands dramatically, “I just have a humble request: may I stay and have the privilege to witness your brilliance, Inspector Lestrade?”

        “You may, but please refrain from causing any disruption to our investigation,”  Lestrade conceded.

        “Of course,” Cox remained unperturbed and responded with a polite smile despite Lestrade’s haughty demeanor.

        And so, Cox and Lestrade along with his groups of detectives proceeded to interrogate the three suspects. They spent an entire afternoon, but still, they could not figure out who was the true murderer. Exhausted, the group gathered in a conference room specially reserved for the investigation team for further discussion.

        “It must be the assistant. Carly bullied her. Look at the bruises on her body; I would probably want to kill Carly if I were her,” one of the detectives speculated. 

        However, Cox quickly shook his head while presenting the autopsy report, “Carly was strangled to death. Based on the angle of the strangulation, the suspect should be someone taller than her. Therefore, the assistant, who is shorter than the victim, couldn’t have killed her. Moreover, the assistant needs money to pay for her bedridden mother’s treatment. She wouldn’t risk her life to kill her employer,” Cox explained.

        “Then it must be the wealthy man!” another detective said, “He has been cheating on his wife with Carly and he is taller than her. Rumor has it that his wife recently found out about his affair. She taught him a hard lesson and demanded he end things with Carly. It is possible that Carly refused his request and he strangled her in a fit of rage.”

        Cox sighed in resignation. He handed the detectives several documents and said, “The wealthy man couldn’t have done it. As written in his diagnosis, his wife fractured his arm last week and it will take him two months to heal completely, which makes it impossible for him to strangle anyone. Besides, the victim was found in different clothes after the estimated time of death with her makeup redone. Given the wealthy man’s status and personality, that would be beyond his capabilities.”

        “Corpse makeup…” the third detective murmured before suddenly exclaiming, “Then it must be the experienced actress. Carly had someone take nude photos of her and used them to blackmail her. Perhaps those threatening letters Carly received were also from her.”

        “Indeed, the motive seems compelling, but unfortunately, she has an alibi,” Cox said with a regretful look at the detective, “She was having breakfast in the hotel restaurant with her manager and assistant at the time the body was thrown off the building.”

        “We-well, maybe she used magic…”

        “No. According to the report, there were no traces of magic at the scene,” Cox said, presenting another document. “Of course, an exceptional mage might be able to conceal such traces. However, if that was the case, I believe none of us would have found the body.”

        “...So, are you saying none of them are the killer?” Lestrade, who had been listening all along, finally spoke. He stared at Cox with a displeased frown, “Then who is the killer?”

        “Be patient, Inspector Lestrade,” Cox said with a confident smile, “The killer will show himself in any minute. He probably has waited for so long.”

        “Huh?” Just as Lestrade was about to inquire further, a knock sounded at the door.

        Then, the door was pushed open. A young man entered carrying two trays of sweets and tea. He placed them on the long table and said with a disarming smile, “Officers, please enjoy these refreshments as a token of our gratitude.” 

        Unexpectedly, the young man’s enthusiastic greetings were met with silence and the officers’ scrutinizing gazes. Their unusual reaction caused the young man’s smile to freeze. He could not help but ask awkwardly, “Uh… What’s wrong? Is there something on my face? Why is everyone looking at me like that?”

        “Is he really the killer?” Lestrade looked at Cox and asked.

        “Yes, it’s him,” Cox stood up and solemnly said, “He is the one who killed Carly.”

        “What… Sir, what are you talking about?” The young man’s face became ashen. He asked with a hint of grievance in his voice, “Is it because of the luggage cart accident this morning? Are you still upset with me?”

        “Upset?” Cox chuckled as if hearing a funny joke. He gently smiled and said, “Why would I be upset? Quite frankly, I’m grateful to you for showing me such an interesting case, Mr. Killer.”

        “What are you talking about? What killer? I-I’m just a regular staff working at this hotel!”

        “Are you?” Cox stepped forward and grabbed the young man’s right hand. He forcefully removed his glove, revealing the deep scratch marks on his hand, as if someone had scratched him with all their might in their final moments. “So, Mr. Regular Staff, care to explain these scratch marks on your hand?”

        Snap!

        The young man shook off Cox’s hand. Clutching his right hand in embarrassment, he said, “I-I accidentally got scratched by a cat.”

        “And how do you explain this?” Cox picked up one of the refreshments and sniffed it delicately, “Clearly this is drugged.”

        “DRUGGED?” Lestrade’s craggy face flushed with rage upon hearing Cox’s words. “How dare you try to kill the police?”

        “No, he’s not that bold. It’s just some strong laxatives,” Cox explained.

        “Huh? But why would he drug us with laxatives?” one of the detectives asked.

        “Because he wants us to leave this room,” Cox slowly walked to a corner where a luggage cart covered in cloth stood, “To retrieve the evidence of his crime.”

        Cox pulled off the cloth, revealing the luggage cart under the light. There were stains on the bottom which had been left by Carly’s urine when her body was transferred via the cart.

        “...Haha, you caught me,” the cheerful and harmless young man’s demeanor shifted to brazen and malevolent, “Yes, you’re right. I killed her.”

        “But there’s still one thing I don’t understand,” Cox remarked, rarely showing a look of confusion. “You could have left the body as it was. Why go through the trouble of dressing her up again, moving her to the top floor, and throwing her off the building?”

        “...It was my way of punishing her,” the young man said venomously, “Do you know how it felt like when you heard your favorite idol was staying at the hotel and you were so excited to finally meet her only to find out that she was just a deceitful woman who bullied her assistant, blackmailed her colleague with nude photos, and seduced married men? All your love for her turned to hate in the blink of an eye. I resent that she shattered my dreams. I gave her a chance to redeem herself, but she ignored my warning and persisted in defiling the sacred status of an idol. She left me no choice but to execute her.”

“Therefore you redressed her and threw her off the building as a way to farewell your broken dreams…” It all became clear to Cox. “Perhaps our expectations and desires for someone can sometimes become a curse laced with venom.”

Afterward, Lestrade took the young man back to the police station, concluding the investigation and lifting the lockdown on the premises. Cox, who finally regained his freedom, hastened his steps toward his destination…</p>
