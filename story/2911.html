        <h1>Wings of Blind Fury - Lucifer</h1>
        <p>
                To take Lucifer’s mind off his eternal imprisonment in the Enochian Tower, the elements created a special illusion and showed him a different path that he could have taken…

        Under the vast azure sky, a tall figure spread his wings and flew from the Enochian Tower to the north. Flying over several towns and villages, he came to a quiet forest and landed in front of a secluded cave.

        Lucifer the guardian slowly walked into the cave with constant vigilance. When he sensed a sudden hint of malice behind his back, he swiftly raised his spear to fend off the attack and fought back with a swing of it. Yet, the assailant dodged his merciless counterattack with a backward jump.

        “You’re as nimble as the rumor says,” said the green-haired assailant—Belial the demon, sizing Lucifer up with respect while fiddling the dagger in his hand. Yet, his tone suddenly changed, “But you came too late. I have waited here for hours.”

        “Unlike you, I have a busy schedule. So you called me here just to sneak attack me? Please excuse me if that’s the case,” Lucifer answered coldly. When he turned around to leave, Belial’s words stopped him.

        “I thought you wanted to take down Zeus,” said Belial with a confident smile.

        “...What do you want?’ Lucifer turned around and asked with his guards up, still.

        “Join forces with me. With your help inside the tower, we demons can break into the realm of gods and beat those insufferably arrogant gods.”

        “And then let you turn this continent or even this planet upside down?’ Lucifer said, with heavy sarcasm. “Don’t treat me like an innocent child. You’re just trying to use me.”

        “Yes, I’m using you but I’m also doing you good. Zeus and those foolish creatures on this land lied to your favorite senior, Saint, and caused his tragic death. Don’t you want to kill them and avenge him?’

        “I…” Lucifer hesitated. Indeed, he wanted to avenge Saint’s death; he wanted to cut those murderers into pieces with his own hands a million times when he knew that Saint had died. Unlike the kindhearted Saint and Michael, Lucifer was a man who would take double the payback if someone wronged him, even if it meant making other people suffer.

        However——

        “As superior species, we take full responsibility to maintain the order of the universe…” The picture of Saint standing brightly on the stage and his resolute words kept flashing across Lucifer’s mind and assuaged the rumbling resentments inside him.

        “If Saint was still alive, he wouldn’t want me to put the whole world at risk for him.” Clenching his hands into fists, Lucifer made up his mind.

        “No. It would only be a disgrace for me to work with you filthy demons.” Lucifer flew out of the cave as soon as he left those words.

        “Since now I know Zeus is the problem, I’ll just have to deal with him.” Turning down the demons’ offer, Lucifer decided to work alone and follow Zeus secretly to find his weakness.

        However, Lucifer was soon discovered. At the end of the realm of gods, an energy ball fired from Zeus’s back and hit Lucifer, who had been hiding in a dark corner, slamming the latter into a wall. Lucifer coughed up blood on impact with his hand on his injured chest. Still, he put up with the pain and looked at the man who conjured the energy ball—it was Khaos, the lord of all gods.

        “What… are you planning to do with the Enochian Tower?” The answer flickered across Lucifer’s mind as he saw the beautiful illusion in mid-air. His eyes widened in disbelief and he said, “You’re planning to gather the elements with the Enochian Tower to build a new realm of gods… Are you out of your mind?! You will drain away this planet and all creatures on this land will die!”

        “They should be honored to sacrifice their meager lives for superior species like us,” Khaos said with a smirk. “Just like you. Now, give us your everything so that we can build our paradise.”

        As Khaos waved his hand, a threatening ball of chaotic power shot right at Lucifer, who wanted to fend off the attack with the power of element but failed to do so because of the overpowering blow he had taken a moment ago.

        ‘Am I going to die just like this? Just do nothing and die in this bastard’s hands who also killed Saint… No! Never! Now that I know the truth, I can’t die doing nothing. At least, at least not before I tell Michael everything!’

        Lucifer gritted his teeth and made a decision—he abandoned his body right before it was devoured by the ball of chaotic power so that his soul could escape. Khaos’ face darkened as he saw the fleeing golden soul. He immediately conjured a beam of chaotic power with a wave of his hand to capture the golden soul but it was already too late.

        “Damn it, Lucifer!” Khaos made a heavy thump on the wall behind him in a fit of rage, leaving a giant dent in it.

        “Should I send someone to get him?” asked Zeus.

        “No need. What could he possibly do? A soul without a shell is nothing but a dying ant.” Khaos turned around and left with a disdainful snort.

        Just like what Khaos had said, Lucifer’s soul gradually weakened after losing his body. The light of his soul was close to fading when he finally got to Michael.

        “Lucifer! What happened to you… Hang in there! I’ll take you back to planet Akkad now and ask the grandmaster to save you!” Michael frantically cupped Lucifer’s soul in his hands and spread his wings but Lucifer stopped him.

        “It’s already too late. Don’t waste your time.”

        “No! I won’t let you die! I—”

        “Michael! Please, listen to me this time.”

        “Lucifer… Why…” Hot tears brimmed over Michael’s eyes and fell on Lucifer’s dimming soul, burning the latter’s heart with a bittersweet feeling.

        “Don’t cry, Michael. You have to fight alone from now on.” And so, Lucifer told Michael everything about Khaos and their plan. By the time he finished, his soul had almost faded away. Knowing that his soul was going to dissipate, he looked at Michael for the very last time, trying to burn his friend’s face into his memory before the end of his life.
“So long, my brother.” That was the last word of Lucifer. 

        “So long, Lucifer. May your soul rest in the galaxy without the restraint of karma, in the name of stars,” Michael murmured hoarsely.

        After that, Michael gathered evidence about Zeus and Khaos’ scheme of usurping the elements so as to convince the Eldus to bring those rapacious holy gods in Tarones to justice…

        ‘It is the keeper’s duty to protect the planet and the creatures on it, and thus a keeper should never act for selfish ends.”
        “I can’t forgive those who hurt Saint. I shall make them pay even if it is against the keeper’s principles!’</p>
