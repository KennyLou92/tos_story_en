        <h1>Radiant Sunshine - Amaterasu</h1>
        <p>
        Finale of Yamato - Ch.6

        Tsukuyomi was fighting Amaterasu with ease in spite of controlling Kagutsuchi to battle Susanoo. She fully utilized the black magic in the battle.

        On the contrary, Amaterasu had been holding back, for every attack from Tsukuyomi reminded her of the tragedy of the book author and the memories between her and her little sister.

        Tsukuyomi consolidated her spiritual energy into daggers to dart at Amaterasu, who raised her fans to fend off. All of a sudden, the attacks stopped. Perplexed, Amaterasu looked around but Tsukuyomi was nowhere to be seen. At this moment, Tsukuyomi’s laughter sounded above her——

        “I got you, Amaterasu.”

        Purple threads were spread onto Amaterasu. Tsukuyomi pulled the threads upon landing, tying Amaterasu up tightly. Restrained, Amaterasu let go of her fan, and she had used up all her fulus.

        “Amaterasu!” Susanoo’s rescuing intention was predicted by Tsukuyomi, who controlled Kagutsuchi to subdue him immediately. At this moment, Amaterasu saw a female shade diffused into Tsukuyomi!

        Tsukuyomi suddenly stopped moving with her spiritual energy turning creepy. In the meantime, a dark aura wrapped her up, devouring her mind——

        “I need to save Tsukuyomi…”

        When Amaterasu was struggling, she was freed by someone, who then offered a hand to lift her up.

        “Yes. It’s not the time to give up now.”

        “Kagutsuchi? How come…”

        “I’ll entrust all my power to you. Bring your dearest sister back!” 

        When Kagutsuchi put his hands on Amaterasu’s shoulders, she felt a revitalizing spiritual energy flowing into her body, and Kagutsuchi collapsed onto the ground after handing the fan to her.

        The evil spirit possessed on Tsukuyomi attacked Amaterasu mercilessly! However, no hint of fear could be found on Amaterasu, who waved her fan calmly. The hot air current fanned from Amaterasu became a shield, protecting her from Tsukuyomi’s attacks. The closer Amaterasu got, the more hysteric Tsukuyomi became.

        “Go away! Stay away from me!”

        Standing in front of Tsukuyomi, Amaterasu threw her fan away and pulled Tsukuyomi into her arms. 

        “It’s alright. I got you. I miss dad and mum just as you do, but they will always live in our hearts. You must be heartbroken when I scolded you harshly. I’m terribly sorry. Let’s go home, shall we?”

        At this moment, Susanoo came over and hugged Tsukuyomi too.

        “There will be a home as long as we three stick together!”

        “Amaterasu...Susanoo…”

        It finally came into Tsukuyomi’s senses that she had never lost her home, and the death of her parents had never taken her home away from her. She was finally freed from the black magic’s bewitchment, and the evil spirit was casted out of her body.

        Regaining sanity, Tsukuyomi hugged Amaterasu and Susanoo back.

        “I’m sorry...So sorry…” she apologised with laughter and tears.

        “Welcome back, Tsukuyomi,” Amaterasu said softly.

        “What a troublesome sister!” Susanoo laughed.

        Collapsing onto the ground, the three siblings hadn’t been laughing so carefreely like this for a long while. And this time, Tsukuyomi knew that she was not alone and she wouldn’t have to reminisce about the old times, for home was where Amaterasu and Susanoo were...
