        <h1>Helmeted Beauty - Nakin</h1>
        <p>
        An orphan whose real place of birth remains unknown. She was adopted by a group of mercenaries who taught her star wars swordsmanship. She eventually became a powerful swordswoman.

She is good at dual-wielding.
She always wears a suit of black armor to add a sense of majesty to herself, believing that she is a man trapped in a womanâ€™s body.
Besides swordsmanship, she is also proficient in driving spaceships and assembling machines. Her biggest weakness is her allergy to dog hairs.</p>
