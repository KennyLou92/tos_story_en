        <h1>Wardragon’s Rise - Seth</h1>
        <p>        In a dark shrine, there was only a feeble light that came from a light ball held by a giant dragon in the center. The light of the ball was weak and uncertain, like flickering candlelight.

        “The Ancestral Elements were getting weaker. Why is that happening?” thought Seth.

        A shaft of brilliant sunlight came through the door crack and it grew brighter with the shaking sound of the stone door. As Seth opened his eyes, he saw someone open the shrine door and walked in. The comer’s silhouette against the daylight made the outside world seem more vivid.

        ‘I can’t find Tefnut and Shu. It seems like they’ve gone out for a journey again,’ Ra said.

        ‘Humph, they dared not take the Ancestral Elements with them this time… It’s fine. I’ll keep guarding them.’ Seth held the light ball in his arms tightly, as though he was afraid that someone might take it.

        ‘You’re still the same.’

        ‘Guarding the Ancestral Elements is my mission,’ said Seth, whose dragon eyes held a red gleam.

        ‘But the world outside is much larger. You’ll miss out on a lot of things if you just stay in the shrine,’ said Ra.

        Seth didn’t respond. He just kept gazing at the ball of light silently and intently, as if he was saying that nothing—not even a living creature—could catch his eye except it.

        Shaking his head, Ra stepped forward with his cane and said, ‘Have it ever crossed your mind that the true meaning of guardianship is not just grasping it firmly in your hands but using the power in it for good?’

        ‘...Of course it has.’ Lifting his eyelids, Seth finally answered Ra, ‘it’s a pity that the Spiritual Beasts have not been able to make use of it… I just don’t understand why they can’t take in the power of their origin, just like I can’t understand why you and Shu created the Spiritual Civilization in the first place.’

        ‘That was a thought we shared after traveling together. Maybe you’ll understand it when you go out and take a look at the world.’

        ‘No need.’ Seth turned around and walked to a wall of the shrine, brightening up the traces on it with the light of Ancestral Elements.

        Those were the claw marks Shu and he left from repelling the enemies to guard the Ancestral Elements throughout all these years. Yet, Shu once again left the shrine for his desire to explore the world outside, leaving his brother, Seth alone for the second time.

        Seth was sunk in gloom at the thought of this.

        Filled with melancholy, Seth wasn’t aware that the Ancestral Elements in his hands also dimmed as his heart did, but Ra saw all of that.

        ‘Did the light of Ancestral Elements just weaken?’ Startled by Ra’s sudden question from the side, Seth immediately hid the light ball behind him.

        ‘Let me take a look—Argh!’ Ra reached out his hands but only got grabbed by Seth, whose strength was so great that almost leave a bruise on Ra’s wrist.

        ‘The Ancestral Elements are getting weaker. No one shall touch them except Shu and me!’

        ‘Calm down, Seth! I have no intention to take it away from you!’

        Ra, who wanted to get away from Seth, raised his cane to repel. Unexpectedly, Seth’s eyes turned red with scorching breath coming out from his mouth where the energy of elements was concentrating. Knowing that this would be a powerful cannon blast, Ra could only channel his powers in desperation. His hands then shone a blinding and searing light——

        ‘Ahhhhhh—!’ Blinded by the strong light, Seth loosened his grip on both Ra and the Ancestral Elements. Seeing the falling light ball, Ra, who had no fear of the blinding light, leaped to catch the ball before it touched the ground.

        As the light faded, Seth shook his head and wanted to pounce on Ra again in anger but he was then stunned by the scene before him.

        The Ancestral Elements were shining brightly in Ra’s hand. That dazzling and stable luminosity was the same as it was at the very beginning, which overwhelmed Seth with surprise and joy. He slowly crawled up from the ground and asked, ‘What did you do to restore the Ancestral Elements?’

        ‘I have no idea.’ Ra gave the ball of light in his hands back to Seth.

        But when Seth took the ball back on his palms, its light dimmed in a second…

        ‘Why?!’ Seth was shocked. He had always wanted to make use of the Ancestral Elements power but never thought that he was the one suppressing them all along.

        “Am I the reason why the power of the Ancestral Elements fails?”

        Seth immediately flew to the wall of the hall and lit the ancient carvings and patterns on it with the light ball in his hands, trying to find a clue in the shrine.

        Seeing his attempt, Ra unleashed a light from his palm and lightened up the entire hall. Yet, even the numerous inscription on the walls didn’t have their answer.

        ‘For all these years in the shrine, the only thing I know was that Shu and I are responsible for guarding the Ancestral Elements but I never truly understand what they are and how to guard them.’

        ‘Staying here won’t get you your answer. Go out and see the world. Maybe you’ll get what you want out there.’

        ‘But my mission—’ Seth subconsciously clenched the light ball. But both Ra and he soon realized that the tighter Seth held on to the Ancestral Elements, the dimmer their light and luster got.

        ‘Try letting go, Seth,’ Ra put out his hand and said, ‘let the Ancestral Elements shine like the way it should.’

        “So it was not only the Spiritual Beasts but also me… I must be not strong enough to use their powers.” Seth gave the light ball in his hands to Ra after a moment of pondering.

        The moment Ra took it, the ball of light shone brightly, so bright that lit up the entire inner hall.

        Seth looked around this unduly familiar shrine. After he and Ra looked at each other for a while, he then said collectedly, ‘Guard the Ancestral Elements before my return.’

        Ra nodded and watched as that red dragon flew out of the shrine to the open sky, heading to the unknown…</p>
