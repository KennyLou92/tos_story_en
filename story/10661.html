        [b][i]Rosalind’s Diary

        Today is my first day of retirement as I leave my post as the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research chief. I felt kind of strange waking up early in the morning as usual without going to work, but I’m sure I’ll get used to it soon. 

        Over the years, I’ve been involved in various challenging research projects. I’ve led a fulfilling and interesting life. Of course, there have been regrets along the way, but life goes on. Instead of looking back in life and dwelling on past mistakes, we should look forward with hope to the bright future ahead.

        And it’s time for me to step out and see the world; perhaps I may find something fascinating.

        Former Chief of the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research
        Rosalind Elsie Franklin[/i][/b]

        Standing in the spacious and spotless corridor of Montana, the battlecruiser, Rosalind gazed through the window. A mesmerized look spread across her face as she was captivated by the boundless vista of the universe.

        ‘So, this is the legendary battlecruiser that has been hunted for a century... It’s truly incredible. No wonder the researchers back then didn’t have the heart to destroy them,’ she murmured.

        As the former chief of the Heptara Unies Department of Scientific Research, Rosalind was, of course, privy to hidden history that had not been disseminated to the public.

        A hundred years ago, the Heptara Unies initiated a new program in the interest of universal security—the Cosmic Patrol Program. A group of researchers dedicated half their lives to creating a series of battlecruisers imbued with formidable power.

        However, during the maiden flight, one of the battleships malfunctioned and launched a devastating attack along with their Guide, resulting in numerous casualties. Subsequently, the Hetara Unies and affiliated parties unanimously decided to destroy all the battleships and their Guides. Devastated by the news, the researchers released the battleships before the destruction order could be executed.

        To apprehend the escaped battleships, the Oroz Management Center and the Heptara Unies issued a wanted notice, offering a bounty. Over a hundred years, some battleships were captured, but many remained elusive. And now, Rosalind was aboard the Montana, one of the wanted battleships.

        Ironically, it was this very fugitive battleship that came to the rescue when the tourist spacecraft was attacked by the Midden, saving the passengers, including Rosalind, who was left with mixed emotions by the fact.

        ‘I never liked this kind of overgeneralization. Just because one battlecruiser had a defect doesn’t mean all of them have the same problem. It’s utterly unreasonable to destroy all of them when they have done nothing wrong.’

        Rosalind sighed, furrowing her brows as she contemplated. ‘Though I don’t know if I can change the minds of those pigheaded, I’ll do what I can at least.’

        As Rosalind turned to head back to her room, she noticed a machina girl perching on the doorway of the grand hall. It was Scáthach, the Guide of Montana, brimming with curiosity as she quietly peered into the hall.

        Amused by the sight, Rosalind stealthily approached the girl from behind, a mischievous glint in her eyes, and suddenly spoke, “What are you doing here?”

        “Shreek!” Scáthach let out a cute shriek, quickly covering her mouth when she realized her volume was too loud. She bowed respectfully and softly apologized to Rosalind, “I-I-I’m sorry!”

        “It’s okay. I’m not scolding you or anything,” Rosalind chuckled, watching the flustered Scáthach with amusement. She gently comforted the girl, “I was just curious why you were clinging to the wall.”

        “Well… I was wondering why they’re crying,” said Scáthach, looking at the people in the hall, her lovely face filled with perplexity. As Rosalind turned her gaze in the same direction, the smile on her face faded, replaced by a solemn expression.

        “Because their family and friends just passed away,” Rosalind explained, her voice tinged with sorrow.

        In the grand hall, more than twenty bodies lay lifeless on the floor. They were the unfortunate passengers who perished during the Midden’s attack on the tourist spacecraft. Their grieving relatives huddled around them, sobbing in anguish.

        “Passed away?” Scáthach repeated, sounding somewhat puzzled.

        “It means they died, that their lives have come to an end.”

        “But… Can’t they just make new ones?”  Scáthach innocently asked.

        Her words amused Rosalind. With her lips curved into a smile, she shook her head and said, “No, it’s not the same. They wouldn’t be the same even if the new ones had identical looks and bodies. Death is irreversible.”

        “So…” Scáthach pondered, her face showing a trace of confusion. “Will I die too? Will Montana die too?”

        “Yes, my dear,” Rosalind extended a hand to stroke Scáthach’s cheek. She spoke tenderly as she shared the profound wisdom she had gained over the years, “Nothing lasts forever in this world. Even the primordial dragons who created this world couldn’t escape the fate of death.”

        “...Why? Why do we die? Can’t everyone just be together forever?” Scáthach felt saddened by the realization.

        “Because it’s only through death that life becomes beautiful,” Rosalind smiled and explained. “Knowing our time is limited is what makes everything so precious.”

        “Um… I don’t quite understand,” Scáthach said.

        “You will understand, someday,” Rosalind reassured her. 

        “Thank you for talking with me, uh…”

        “Rosalind.”

        “Miss Rosalind, I—” As much as Scáthach wanted to continue her conversation with Rosalind, a male android suddenly appeared and interrupted them.

        “Scáthach, that male machina is awake,” the android, Montana, informed her.

        “What? That’s so soon!” Scáthach exclaimed in surprise. “He was heavily injured and needs proper care. Oh! I remember there are some liquid nutrients specially designed for machinas in the warehouse. I’ll go get them for him!”

        Scáthach turned around and hurriedly ran off, but she soon came back after going a few steps. She looked apologetically at Rosalind and said, “I’m sorry but I have to go. Can I find you later?”

        “Of course, my dear.”

        Scáthach waved enthusiastically to Rosalind as she ran, her figure disappearing down the corridor. Surprisingly, Montana’s android remained.

        “Rosalind Elsie Franklin,” Montana addressed Rosalind, stating her full name clearly. He had discovered her identity but he did not say it out loud. Instead, he sincerely said, “Thank you for talking with her.”

        “She already thanked me. It was just a brief conversation. It was no big deal.”

        “Yes, it is. Not everyone likes having us around,” Montana responded.

        “So, you know,” Rosalind was slightly surprised, and she asked, “Then why did you come back?”

        “Because it’s the only way.”

        “...Indeed, but the choice you made is very dangerous, and the chances of survival are slim,” Rosalind remarked.

        “Yes, I understand, but I will Scáthach, come what may,” Montana declared with unwavering determination.

        ‘They are such adorable children, more energetic and kind than any of those in power, yet fate has been unsparing toward them, posing tough challenges... Oh, our great primordial dragons, I sincerely pray that their future is full of peace and hope.’

        However, Rosalind’s prayer was unanswered.

        Three battlecruisers approached from a distance. To stop the attack, Scáthach and the others infiltrated the battleships and took control of two of them, Yet, Scáthach’s target was incredibly resistant—it launched a devastating strike before control could be seized.

        ‘That’s the light of an anti-matter element projectile!” Rosalind recognized the familiar iridescent radiance from her experience in the research department. She instantly understood the nature of the light which filled her heart with despair.

        Once that projectile exploded, everything nearby would be mercilessly consumed, vaporizing all life in an instant.

        It was a cruel fact that would plunge everyone into the depths of despair.

        “All passengers on board, please make your way to the evacuation zone and board the tourist spacecraft immediately.” Montana’s voice brought Rosalind back to her senses.

        While the announcement repeated incessantly, the passengers on board, who finally realized the gravity of the situation, swiftly returned to the tourist spacecraft. Rosalind, on the other hand, assisted with the evacuation, becoming one of the last individuals remaining.

        Right before she stepped onto the tourist spacecraft, she looked up to the void and asked, “Montana, are you planning to sacrifice yourself?”

        After a brief silence, Montana’s humanoid appeared in front of Rosalind and calmly replied, “Yes, it is the only solution that has the lowest casualty rate and the highest chance of success.”

        “What about Scáthach?” Rosalind asked.

        “...She will get over it. She is stronger than we think. Besides, my sacrifice will give her leverage to seek lenient punishment,” he answered.

        “She won’t be happy about it,” Rosalind remarked.

        “But she will live,” Montana earnestly pleaded, “So, Miss Rosalind, would you help me?”

        “You—” Lost for words, Rosalind let out a deep sigh as she nodded, “Fine.”

        “Thank you. Please board the spacecraft immediately; time is running out.”

        Prompted by Montana, Rosalind boarded the tourist spacecraft. However, her heart remained unsettled even when the spacecraft’s engines had been powered up and the lift-off had commenced. She could not shake off the heartbroken look on Scáthach’s face when they had the conversation about Montana’s death earlier. Finally, with a determined grit of her teeth, she dashed out of the cabin and leaped onto the battleship just as the spacecraft was about to depart.

        To avoid detection by Montana, Rosalind activated the signal blocker she had developed using magic.  It allowed her to remain hidden temporarily, rendering her existence undetectable by any sensors. Unaware of her presence, Montana transformed into combat mode and accelerated rapidly toward the projectile. It was until he initiated his self-destruct sequence and the final countdown started that he realized someone had infiltrated his control room.

        In the center of the room was a stack of countless mechinas’ cores, entangled by metallic tendrils. At the end of those tendrils bloomed a magnificent metallic flower, which served as the power core of Montana.

        Through the meticulous refinement of the residual life essences trapped within the deceased machinas’ cores, researchers had successfully nurtured a new consciousness—an extraordinary sentient being that was capable of controlling a large number of metallic components after numerous failed attempts.

        “Rosalind! What are you doing here?” Montana, rarely surprised and enraged, shouted in disbelief as his humanoid appeared beside Rosalind.

        “I’m here to take you with me,” Rosalind replied, focusing on Montana’s core. With a sharp surgical blade she conjured with magic power, she swiftly separated the metallic tendrils from the cores.

        “You can’t do this! It’s impossible to separate my core before the explosion!” Montana protested.

        “Do you want to see Scáthach again or not?” Rosalind asked.

        “...I do, of course I do.”

        “Then stop wasting time and help me!” Rosalind urged.

        At Rosalind’s insistence, Montana resignedly surrendered and helped her to separate the core. Against all odds, they managed to detach the core just moments before the self-destruct countdown reached twenty seconds. However, it was impossible for them to escape the battleship in such a short timeframe. 

        Undeterred, Rosalind reached into her pocket and took out a metallic device which transformed into a door as she pressed the button.

        “Is that…a teleportation device?” Montana questioned.

        “Yes, it’s a portable magic portal I secretly invented, but it’s still a prototype. The chance we have is fifty-fifty. Are you willing to take the gamble?” Rosalind asked.

        “Sure.” Montana nodded. It was the only option they had.

        With Montana’s core cradled in her arms, Rosalind fearlessly leaped into the teleportation device. In the blink of an eye, their figures vanished, and just as the self-destruct sequence was activated, a brilliant explosion erupted in space, creating a dazzling spectacle akin to the birth of a new star...</p>
