                “Life is short while love is eternal...” 

        When she was just an infant, she suffered from organ failure due to dehydration.  At death’s door, she was saved by her own self and Jiang Yun-Fan who traveled back through time from the future.  Tang Yu-Rou was grateful for being given twenty more years to live and falling in love with Jiang Yun-Fan.  They shared every happy and sad moment together.  She felt blessed and there was nothing more to regret.  After she passed away, her soul probably stayed behind her lover, keeping him away from harm...</p>
