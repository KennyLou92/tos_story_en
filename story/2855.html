        <h1>Jeopardous Conspiracy - Endor</h1>
        <p>
                After countless battles, the spirits of the deceased gave everything to Endor and showed her a non-existent future with the dark elements’ power…

        “We all understand; this is an endless endeavor.”

        Standing before the Ocean of Gates, the necromancer and the young druid remained locked in a stalemate. She opened her monochromatic eyes to look at the robust man she admired.

        “The earth is perpetual, just as the soul is everlasting,” Ducan expressed his resolution in a warm tone.

        Endor knew that she and Duncan were merely heading in different directions and their common wish never changed. However, fate demanded an answer, so she started a fight with Duncan, who had the power of the earth, by using the bones of an ancient beast as a medium to control the deceased souls and activate the power of the dark elements.

        Yet, using the power of the dead came with a side effect—it deepened Endor’s connection with the dead whose sorrow and resentments kept flowing into her mind and stirring her emotions, making it difficult for her to concentrate.

        “Why are you fighting the man you love?”
        “Stop being so stubborn and just follow your heart.”
        “You will be happy as long as you compromise.”

        “No!” Endor screamed in her mind. “I have to open the seal on the Enochian Tower so that the homeless spirits can return to where they belong!”

        With unshakeable conviction, Endor ignored the spirits’ words and focused on performing necromancy. In the end, she defeated Duncan. Then, she joined forces with Nathaniel and defeated the angels with the human army, thus opening the gate to the realm of gods.

        As the road to the realm of gods was finally reopened, the spirits who had been abandoned by the gods rushed in like a swarm of hornets. However, the spirits’ return upset the plans laid out by some of the gods and changed the balance among different godly factions.

        It soon became Endor’s misfortune—she got entangled with the gods’ civil war. Captured by Zeus, the King of Gods, she was held in the hall of gods for trial.

        “Human, do you plead guilty?” asked Zeus, who looked down at Endor as if he were looking at an ant.

        Fearlessly, Endor chastised the almighty god, “It is you who should be guilty! You abandoned the spirits of your people and let them stray and wander in the human realm! You should be ashamed of yourselves!”

        “Human, how dare you!” In a fit of rage, Zeus pointed at Endor and commanded, “Take this impudent mortal to the frozen prison!”

        Under the order of the King of Gods, Endor was imprisoned in the depths of the realm of gods. She thought that she would die there but she later managed to escape with the deceased spirits’ help.

        Despite the setback, Endor refused to give up after escaping from the realm of gods. She continued to find ancient spirits who were lost on the battlefields and sneak them back into the realm of gods. Subsequently, the gods deemed her a criminal and sought her arrest.  People who were ignorant of the context were deployed to capture her. On the run, Endor’s life diverged greatly from what she was; life forced her to side with the demons and she was never freed from the constant danger in her everyday life.

        One day, eventually, she had no choice but to jump into the Dark Cove to elude the gods in pursuit. However, her successful escape only came with a deeply wounded body.

        “Ha, you’re as stupid as usual, the little soul bearing the body.” The evil deity—the lord of the Dark Cove—taunted Endor, who was lying prone on the ground.

        “You… It was you who took colors away from my eyes… It was you who gave me that power…” Endor murmured while running out of breath. With her monochromatic eyes shrouded by a mist of tears, she seemed to be mourning for her loss, yet at the same time, happy for what she had gotten.

        “So? You want me to restore everything?”

        “No, I…’ Not knowing how to answer the question, Endor pretended she was the young druid and said, “…I just wanted to complain.”

        “Humph, the weak always create trouble.” The evil deity chuckled mischievously as he had a stroke of inspiration. He said, “But you’re the good kind because you create troubles for those condescending gods.”

        Although the evil deity was bound to the Dark Cove, he still had ways to hear around the world, and thus he knew about what Endor had done in the realm of gods.

        Certainly, the evil deity’s deep-rooted hatred against the gods would not allow him to let go of this opportunity, so he bent towards the dying Endor and whispered, “You’re dying but I can save you.”

        “...What is the price?”

        “It seems like you’re not that stupid after all.” Extending a hand to touch Endor’s cheek just like the way he did a long time ago, the evil deity said with disdain and resentment, “Be my pawn and fool the gods.”

        Endor had no choice, just like when she was little. In order to survive and liberate the spirits of the dead, she could only make a deal with the evil deity and become his pawn, fighting against the gods…

        ‘Although I have pity for the deceased, I will not waver at their grief. I will free the spirits from the human realm so as to free myself from them…’</p>
