        Imperial Heroes - The Finishing Battle Ch.15

        After training soldiers, Sun Ce returned to his room for a rest.  On the way he saw Zhurong’s maiden walk out holding a bowl of medicine.  “Hold on.  Isn't it tocolytic for Zhurong?  Why is it not taken?” He asked out of concern.

        “Master, Madam refused and ordered me to take it away.”

        “...She is being stubborn again...” Sun Ce frowned, and then he took the tray from maiden's hands.  “I’ll give her myself.”

        Regardless of the maiden's dissuasion, Sun Ce went directly into Zhurong's room, putting the medicine right in front of the occupied Zhurong.

        “Drink it.”

        “It has been seven months already.  I’m fine.” She answered without even raising her head.

        However, Sun Ce did not buy the excuse.  “I'll be standing here until you drink it.” He said determinedly with his arms crossed.

        Finally, Zhurong raised her head and squinted.  “Are you a nanny?  Girls hate long-winded men, you know?”

        “You——”

        Someone's knock had interrupted the conversations.  As the soldier was permitted to come in, he left a piece of note before his departure.  Zhurong changed into an evil smile as soon as she read it.

        Shivering with fear, Sun Ce put on a serious look.  “News about Cao Cao?”

        “Xiahou Dun was killed by Sun's Army.”

        “Xiahou Dun...she is with Cao Cao.” Back when Sun Ce met the former emperor, he had a few encounters with her.  She was always behind Cao Cao like a servant.

        “Although it's good news, but no big deal anyways.”

        “No.  In fifthteen days, he'll march on the Sun's city.”

        “Em?  Why?  She is just a tool to Cao Cao.”

        “Not true.  Xiahou Dun is more than that.” Zhurong recalled that when Meng Huo killed his brother in front of Cao Cao, the interaction between him and Xiahou Dun was not as simple as a master-servant relationship.  It was more like a deeper, intimate bonding.

        “For her, Cao Cao will take everything to revenge.” Zhurong had all kinds of thoughts, looking at her own hands.  “Just like me.”

        At the moment, they both remained silent, until Sun Ce broke it with a slight sigh.  “Alright, then we'll head north to reinforce brother Quan.  Just leave it to me.”

        “No, we aren't going there.”

        “Why?” Shocked again, Sun Ce could never catch up with the mindset of Zhurong.

        “We go to Cao's city.  Now that he is using all the army force to battle with Sun's, it means Cao's city is nothing but an empty fort.  Taking it down will be much easier.” She smiled, carrying the weight of her wild ambition.

        “I don't just want Cao Cao's life.  I want him to lose everything.”

        As Zhurong expected, it took less than a day for them to seize Cao's city.  Watching the burning hell of these palaces, Zhurong trembled with fury.

        “That bastard...He is not coming back at all...”

        “...Seal the entire city.”

        “What's going on?  Zhurong, what are you trying to do after sealing the city!” Sun Ce stepped forward to question her.

        “Burn everything down.” Zhurong was cold as if she had abandoned all the emotions.  “Since Cao Cao has given up on his people, they're useless to me too.  I'll burn this place down.”

        “You...” Sun Ce gazed at her with sorrow.  “If Meng Huo were here, he would definitely stop you from sacrificing many innocent lives just for one man.”

        Sun Ce's words reminded Zhurong of her past memories...

        “Dear, it's Valentine's Day.  Make a wish.” Meng Huo handed a pen and a paper to her, who refused as she had nothing to hope for.  So Meng Huo just finished it on his own.

        Out of curiosity, Zhurong saw his writings “I wish all people can live peacefully”; Meng Huo felt shy to say, “I'm happy when I see people smile.  So this is for myself too.” 

        “Right...He is always that kind and gentle...” Zhurong softened her expressions, as if she picked up the humanity she was supposed to have.

        “...Let's go.” Zhurong said as she turned around; and Sun Ce finally felt relieved when she sorted herself out.  Then he followed Zhurong to Sun's city.

        Corpses had already piled up before the city gate, but it did not put an end to this war.  Zhurong and Sun Ce galloped to the center, raised the Cao's flag high and burnt it.  “Our army has taken Cao's city.  Surrender if you don't want your family gets hurt,” he announced.

        The morale of Cao's army was poor in the face of this desperate war.  And Sun Ce's words had shattered the very last bit of their fighting will.  Soon they surrendered.  However, Zhurong found something off when she looked over the battlefield.

        “...Cao Cao is not here...”

        “...He went to the gate.” A man's voice sounded; Sun Ce looked back and saw a lady is helping a haughty man to come over.

        “He is...Lü Bu, and she is his wife Diaochan.”

        “That bastard said he needed to kill Sun Quan, so he broke in,” Lü Bu continued.

        “What?” Sun Ce answered agitatedly.  “I have to save my brother!”

        “Wait.” Zhurong stopped him.  “You can’t make it through.  Get on.”

        Zhurong summoned the fire beast for Sun Ce.  Controlled by Zhurong, the beast climbed up the city walls to the top before long, leaping over to the Sun’s territory.

        During the mid air, Sun Ce was shocked by what he saw——Cao Cao was galloping, trying to kill Sun Quan.

        “Brother!” Sun Ce jumped down from the air regardless of the height, and made his way to block Cao Cao’s attack——

        Clash!

        Without expecting this, Cao Cao’s horse was startled to struggle, which made him abandone the ride.

        “Em...what happened...Bro... broooother!” Sun Quan forgot he was at the edge of death when Sun Ce suddenly appeared, almost making him stutter.

        A family reunion brightened up Sun Ce’s day.  “Quan, long time no see,” he wore a bright smile.

        “You...Sun Ce...How come you’re still alive.” Cao Cao gazed at him, and burst into laughter will his bloodstained face.  “HAHAHA!  Wonderful!  Then I can torture you to death in front of Sun Quan.  I’ll show him the pain of losing someone important again!”

        “Cao Cao…” Sun Ce squinted.  “The world has no place for a lunatic monster like you.  Today I must kill you.”

        During the face off, the first who initiated an attack was Cao Cao.  He held a grip, sprinting towards Sun Ce, who then bent down to guard it.  Next second, Cao Cao turned his body agilely to change his attack direction and swing a horizontal slash. 

        Sun Ce withstood the strike by countering his move, but Cao Cao pulled his blade back at once, adjusted his cut to scratch Sun Ce's left arm to bleed.

        “Brother!  I'm here with you!” Sun Quan was anxious when he knew Sun Ce was injured.  He held the spear to thrust Cao Cao in the back.  A flicker of silver flashed ——Cao Cao couched down, picked up a dead soldier's sword to block it and gave Sun Quan's abdomen a hard kick. 

        “Ah!” The unbearable pain forced him to step back and fall to the ground.

        “Cao Cao!” Gritting his teeth, Sun Ce pounced on him; in the nick of time, Cao Cao parried it as he sensed a threat.  Two metal weapons were clashing with each other.

        “End game.” Cao Cao wore an evil smile, putting his weight all onto the blade.  Crack!  Sun Ce's weapon was broken into half, causing him to kneel on the ground due to the pressure.  Suddenly, he was shrouded in shadow——Cao Cao looked down on Sun Ce arrogantly.

        “For Dun's death, you DIE!” Cao Cao slashed his blade——

        Blood was shed amid the silver gleam.

        However, the blood was Cao Cao's.  His right arm was cut off.

        At the critical moment, Sun Quan tossed his spear to Sun Ce, who managed to evade Cao Cao's lethal attack by instinct and slashed his arm successfully.

        Looking at his own right arm bleeding with a gush, Cao Cao's hope was shattered.

        “No...I can't...I can't die yet...Before I spread misery to all people in this world, I CAN'T DIE! AHHHHH——!”

        Shouting with all his strength, Cao Cao stuck his left-hand fingers into the wound.

        “He...has gone mad!” Shocked, Sun Ce witnessed something that utterly stunned him to speechless——Cao Cao's right arm regenerated at an amazing speed, and kept on bulging strangely, eventually turning into a gigantic arm ever larger than Cao Cao in size.

        “You all are going to hell today!”

        “Brother!  Run!”

        Even if Sun Ce wanted to, he could not as he was grabbed and raised to the mid air.

        “You want me to break your right arm or left——AHH!”

        Whoosh!  Crimson fire was casted over Cao Cao's monstrous arm.  Screaming in pain, he pulled back and let go of Sun Ce right away.

        “Cough...Zhurong...” 

        Zurong, riding the fire beast, saved him in time.  The flames all over her were as divine as god.

        “He is mine.” Zhurong gazed at the berserk with burning animosity.  “Countdown to the end of your life!”</p>
