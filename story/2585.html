        <h1>Innocent Temptation - Eve</h1>
        <p>
                In a luxurious bedroom, a female demon was lying on the bed. Her body was so emaciated that everyone would believe she was dead if they didn’t see the heaving of her chest.

        The demon was by no means ordinary. She was the grand duchess and the leader of the 7 aristocrats. However, the tides turned as she fell in love with a disgraced god. Giving birth to her daughter had wrecked her body. And there she was, lying in bed helplessly.

        A pitter-patter of footsteps echoed in the hallway, bringing a girl with a petite figure to the bedroom door. Her orange hair flipped as she bounced up and down. She looked gorgeous.

        “Mom!” The 5-year-old girl thrust herself to the bedside and grabbed her mother’s skinny hands. Her movements woke the grand duchess up.

        “It’s you, Eve… My beloved daughter...” The grand duchess wanted to hold the girl’s hands, but was too weak to do so. She covered her hands on Eve’s and murmured feebly, “I can’t be with you any longer.” 

        “Boohoo… No, no… Don’t leave me, mom...” Poor little Eve was crying her eyes out. As young as she was, her beauty was already blooming.

        “Eve… Your road ahead must be really tough, but remember, you have to stay strong...”

        “Okay… I will try my best.” said Little Eve in a reassuring manner, arching her back. The grand duchess was relieved by her response and gave her a smile.

        “Maybe, if I hadn’t fallen in love with your father and given birth to you, I could’ve lived longer and enjoyed the privileges of my status as the leader of the seven aristocrats. But a life like this wouldn’t be a complete one.” said the grand duchess as she looked at Eve affectionately, “Dear Eve, I feel so complete after falling in love with your father and finding my true love. I’m so much happier than I was before I met him.”

        The smile on the grand duchess’ face was full of bliss and peace, radiating the brilliance of life. Eve was deeply moved. 

        “Eve, my daughter. May you find the love of your life too. That’d be a marvelous miracle...” The last beam of light in the duchess’ eyes faded, her life perished.

        Observing the peaceful face of her mother, Eve was not afraid at all. Rather, she was a little envious. A fanciful imagination about “true love” was implanted in her heart. Someday, she prayed, that she’d be able to find the love of her life just like her mother.

        However, as the heiress of the grand duchess, it was impossible for Eve to find a lover freely. The pressure from her kin almost suffocated her. Like a bird trapped in a fancy cage, she witnessed how her relatives manipulated each other for their own benefits.

        Eve wanted to escape from these despicable people but lacked what she needed until his presence— Baal the grand prince.

        He courted her actively and wrote her passionate letters, but Eve was clear that all Baal had wanted was her power. She considered it a golden opportunity to break free, so she proceeded to meet Baal.

        “You’re just as gorgeous as I imagined.” Elegantly, Baal gave Eve a light kiss on her right hand and looked into her eyes lovingly, “Even if you rejected me a million times, I’d still wait for you.”

        “...Ha, grand prince, you’re quite good at acting. Very interesting.” Eve giggled, her stunning eyes examined Baal closely, “You didn’t fall in love with me at all. I detest lies, they’re despicable. Tell me your wish and what you can offer.”

        Baal’s loving smile vanished, giving way to an expression of haughty pride as he proudly declared, “Get engaged with me, and I’ll grant you the freedom that you’ve always wanted.”

        Baal took out a sphere, which reflected a lively world.

        “Just borrow me your name. I’ll eliminate all the unloyal aristocrats for you and make you a pioneer, then you can go to a whole new world and pursue the life that you’ve been longing for.”

        Eve was completely ignorant of what Baal said since the world reflected in the sphere had attracted all her attention.

        “In such a magnificent world, I can definitely find the true love that mother told me about.”

        As a result, Eve accepted Baal’s terms and became his fiancée. Granting him the power of her family, Baal managed to eradicate the corrupted aristocrats.

        “Eve.” Baal called her as he came to the balcony. Eve was looking at the landscape somewhere far away.

        Eve didn’t move until Baal came to stand next to her. She said lightly, “It used to be beautiful here, but everything has withered.”

        “Nothing lasts forever.” Putting his hands behind him, Baal looked into the distance too. But what he saw was completely different from Eve. “Even if you go to Continent Tarones, you won’t be able to find what you want.”

        “How would you know without trying?” Eve smiled optimistically. The expression on her delicate and innocent face resembled that of a fearless youth. “I’ve got to find it, the marvelous miracle.”

        “Is that so… Good luck, then.” Baal refrained from saying more and left Eve alone, who got her hopes up and travelled to the continent in excitement.

        Nevertheless, Baal was right. 

        Drenched in blood and mud, Eve sat on the ground in the pouring rain and felt the iciness of the raindrops. 

        “Sigh… True love is so fragile. Is it real that nothing lasts forever?”

        “No, something does last forever.” A crisp male voice interrupted her thoughts, and Eve tilted her head to see who it was. Two people approached her in the rain. She recognized one of them— it was her “fiance”. The other was a handsome young man, who answered her a moment ago.

        But Eve didn’t care about his identity, she was more concerned by what he’d said. Somehow rashly, she asked, “What is it?”

        The young man came closer and pointed his finger to Eve, “The love you have for yourself.”

        “My love...”

        “If the other kinds of love can’t satisfy you, why don’t you love yourself? It will be perpetual. ”

        “...Huh, good idea.” Eve chuckled, “You’re interesting. I like you.”

        “I like you too. Join in our plan, Eve.” Laplace, the ancient demon, held out his hand invitingly. 

        Without the slightest hesitation, Eve shook his hand.</p>
