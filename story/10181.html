        <h1>Toushirou Hijikata</h1>
        <p>
        Vice-Commander of the Shinsengumi, but more precisely an extreme Mayora. He puts mayonnaise on anything as long as it is food.

Although he is a rabid lover of mayonnaise, he is also the most reasonable person in the Shinsengumi who often butts in when Okita and Kondo et al talk.

Feared by both his enemies and his underlings, he is known as the  “Demonic Vice-Commander”. In contrast to his strict and warlike personality, he has a tendency to cry while watching movie scenes that are not particularly emotional.</p>
