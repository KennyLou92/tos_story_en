        <h1>Thorns of Ambivalence - Diarmuid</h1>
        <p>        Ever since that night, glimmers of blacklight turned into the strongest warrior and the green figure with two lances returned to the battlefield. Indulged in the pleasure of slaughter, he only simmered down under the starry sky…

        One night, Diarmuid walking in the jungle. Suddenly, he caught a glimpse of a faint light floating across the woods. Then a maiden’s figure in his memory resurfaced, stirring his heart.

        ‘Master, are you missing her?’ asked Amor, one of the lance spirits.

        Just as Diarmuid was going to answer her, he was astounded by the growing number of floating lights and convinced that he had come to that corner in his memory again—the garden of fireflies, a secret place that he and Isabel went to when they eloped.

        Memories came flooding back…

        ‘I will always love you and stay loyal to you no matter what, until eternity.’

        Looking Diarmuid in the eye, Isabel made her wedding vow under the moonlight and the eye of the two lances. The two had a secret wedding that no one knew during their run. Isabel then danced on a dilapidated stone platform. It was a dance that Diarmuid would never forget.

        Just then, some light glimmers followed as she swung her hands. With a spin, Isabel held the glimmers on her palms curiously.

        ‘Are they elves? Sea elves? Flower elves?’ Isabel followed the flowing light in excitement. As she waved her hands in the woods, Diarmuid immediately walked over. Countless stars were floating under the dark shadow of the trees—they were not elves but fireflies. Landing on Isabel, they embellished her beauty with extra grace…

        ‘I remember that you were also looking for the elves when we first met,’ said Diarmuid.

        ‘When I was small, my family brushed me aside, but I was never lonely because the elves in the garden always chatted with me. And now I’m not alone anymore, because I have you by my side.’

        Hearing Isabel’s words, Diarmuid couldn’t help but draw her into his arms. The latter also wrapped her arms around his waist and asked him to dance with her. Following their rhythm, the fireflies danced in the woods.

        At that moment, the two left their fate of being pursued behind their mind. Under the milky way, the two love birds pranced freely with one accord, weaving their own future…

        ‘This is our secret garden.’ Diarmuid was lost in memory lane.

        He only came back to his senses when he caught an unpleasant smell and found the burning jungle in front of him… </p>
