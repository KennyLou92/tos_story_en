        <h1>Azai the Word Defender</h1>
        <p>Finale of Sengoku Samurai - Ch. 8

        Unlike normal people, Azai was devoid of emotion and desire since the day he was born. After Teruaki—his only close elder brother—died, he began to search for his so-called ‘wish’. By some strange chance, he met a mysterious man who talked him into participating in a survival game on an island where he could get his wish.

        During the game, Azai left the group after having a disagreement with the other contestants. He lived alone on this island full of mad men since then, until he met Oichi the maiden and found her to be the breath of his life—attracted by her unique traits of peril and vulnerability, he decided to protect her.

        Later, coincidentally, they found a boat. After confirming that the boat could still function, Azai and Oichi continued their journey searching for the latter’s brother, Nobunaga. However, their search did not make any progress until a deafening boom suddenly came from the center of a lake.

        ‘What is happening?’ Oichi looked at the center of the lake that was wreathed in smoke, with a concerned look on her face.

        ‘No idea, but someone must have done something… Maybe there’s a clue as to your brother’s whereabouts.’ Azai looked at Oichi. Declined to give her false hope, he did not make an assertion.

        ‘I’m willing to give it a try as long as there is a flicker of hope!’ Oichi did not cop out. She might be fragile-looking but she was not weak. She would not give up easily even if what awaited ahead could be a disappointment.

        ‘Alright then. Stay behind me.’ Walking ahead while guarding Oichi, Azai promptly headed toward the lake and killed every enemy they met along the way. Soon, they arrived at the lake. They were stunned when they saw the house standing in the center of the lake, but something even more surprising happened—they saw a cool beauty walking out of the lake house while carrying a young man whose thigh was injured.

        ‘Brother!’ Oichi shouted in surprise when she saw the young man’s face and immediately walked toward him.

        Hearing the shout, Nobunaga, the young man lifted his head. A smile spread across his face the moment he saw Oichi, and he said, ‘Oichi! I knew you’d be fine.’

        ‘It’s all thanks to Azai. He protected me.’ Oichi moved sideways and signaled Azai to walk forward. The latter simply nodded and remained quiet.

        As the feeling of surprise of the reunion subsided, Oichi noticed the wound on Nobunaga’s leg and asked with a frown, ‘Brother, is your leg alright?’

        ‘He’s okay. He’s not gonna die.’ The girl who was supporting Nobunaga answered Oichi. It took a moment for Oichi to pluck up enough courage to ask the girl, ‘So it was you who saved my brother?’

        ‘Yeah. Her name is Nohime. She has saved me a couple of times,’ said Nobunaga with a wink and a smile. Seeing his younger sister again had put him in such an ecstatic mood which was good enough for him to put aside the stabbing pain. However, Nohime was not happy to see the insouciant look on his face.

        ‘Don’t be so full of joy yet. The crisis isn’t over——’ A violent earthquake interrupted Nohime’s words. The shaking was so great that it threw Oichi off balance, so Azai immediately held her. The earthquake only stopped after a while.

        As soon as the ground stopped shaking, Nobunaga cursed, ‘It’s all that bastard’s fault!’

        ‘That bastard?’ asked Azai.

        ‘This is what happened…’ And so, Nobunaga filled Oichi and Azai in on the whole incident.

        ‘So it is all a set-up and now that mysterious man is going to destroy the whole island,’ Oichi summarized.

        ‘Yes, and that’s why we have to find a way out of this island as soon as possible before it gets destroyed.’ Nohime frowned nervously and said, ‘I don’t know how much time we have left so we’d better hurry.’

        Azai and Oichi looked at each other as they heard Nohime. The smiles in their eyes puzzled Nohime and Nobunaga. In the end, Oichi broke the silence and said, ‘There’s no need for it.’

        ‘Huh? Why?’

        ‘It’s because we’ve already found a way out of here,’ Azai explained.

        Nohime and Nobunaga looked at each other in astonishment. After a short moment, Nobunaga laughed heartily, ‘I knew my sister always brings good luck!’

        ‘Can you lead the way?’ asked Nohime with a smile.

        And so, following Azai and Oichi’s lead, the group went back to the coast smoothly. However, something happened when they tried to start the boat.

        ‘The boat can’t move. Something is stuck beneath the water,’ said Nohime with a solemn expression, who felt a premonition about what might happen.

        ‘I’ll go down and check.’ Just as Nobunaga was about to stand up, Oichi held him down and said, ‘Your leg is injured! You can’t get under the water!’

        ‘I’ll go,’ said Azai. Hesitantly, Oichi gave him a nod, ‘Okay, but be careful.’

        Azai walked to the side of the boat, took off his coat, and jumped into the water with a splash. Soon after he dived into the water, he found the culprit that was holding the boat—it was the same metamorphosed monster that had been lurking in the boat!

        The monster was grabbing the bottom of the boat tightly with its soft tentacles. It immediately lifted one of its tentacles and swung it to attack as it sensed the approaching Azai.

        In response to Azai’s aroused killing intent, the pocket watch on his chest flashed and turned into a giant scythe in the blink of an eye. With a deft jump and a twist of his body, he then swung the scythe and cut off the attacking tentacle.

        ——Squeak!

        Filled with rage at its cut tentacle, the monster emitted a shrill and piercing sonic wave that traveled through the water and went straight into Azai’s head, stunning him with a sensation of nausea.

        While Azai was immobilized, the monster let go of the boat and attacked him with all its seven tentacles, leaving its prey no chance to escape.。

        “No… I can’t die yet! I have to protect her!” At Azai’s thought, the scythe in his hand unleashed a bright light and transformed into an enormous octagonal throwing star. Like lightning, flashes of light flew across the bottom of the sea wherever the blades went.

        All seven tentacles of the monster were cut off, one of which was yet tipped with vibrant claret. Azai pressed on his flank that had been pierced by the tentacle. While blood kept seeping through his fingers, he was not scared but rather relieved. Losing all its tentacles, the metamorphosed monster could no longer hold the boat but only flee in terror.

        When Azai bore the pain and swam to the water surface, he saw another scene that made his heart skip a beat—a swarm of mad men came from the center of the island. Some of them were climbing the boat’s stern, whereas Nobunaga, Nohime and Oichi were struggling to repel them. However, there were too many mad men which put the three of them at a disadvantage, especially Oichi, who was about to be dragged out of the boat by a mad man that was pulling her hair!

        ‘Let go of her!’ With a glare, Azai jumped out of the water and shot the octagonal throwing star in his hand. After slashing the mad man who was pulling Oichi down and tearing those who were clobbering Nobunaga and Nohime into pieces, the throwing star returned to Azai’s hand.

        ‘Go start the boat!’ As Azai shouted, Nohime immediately ran to the captain’s cabin while Nobunga continued to fend off those mad men who climbed onto the boat.

        Unexpectedly, Azai went to the front instead of boarding the boat. With a twist of his wrist, the throwing star in his hand turned into a katana. He then stood sideways, guarding the boat as though a patron saint.

        ‘Azai! The boat is leaving! Get on the boat now!’ Leaning on the edge of the boat, Oichi reached out her hand to Azai, only to see the latter shaking his head; his face went terribly pale from the excessive loss of blood.

        ‘I can’t,’ said Azai, lowering his eyes. It was only until then did Oichi see the vivid crimson on his lower body. A heart-wrenching pain and despair flooded Oichi like a tsunami, filling her eyes with tears. There was as if a lump in her throat that she could barely find her voice until a moment later when she finally spoke in a raspy voice, ‘Then… I-I’ll come with you.’

        Oichi wanted to jump off the boat but Nobunaga held her body and stopped her, yelling vehemently with his red-rimmed eyes, ‘Oichi! No! Stop!’

        ‘No! I’m going with him!’ Oichi struggled with sobs. After slashing another mad man that pounced on him, Azai turned around and looked at Oichi affectionately. Lifting the corners of his mouth, he gave her the last smile in his life.

        ‘Oichi, don’t cry… I feel so lucky that I got to protect you.’

        ‘No! NOOO! Let me go! Brother! Let me GOOO——!’ Oichi howled in agony, tears pouring down her face like rain. As much as she wanted to run to Azai, Nobunaga locked her in his embrace with all his strength.

        ‘Start the boat!’Seeing another wave of mad men coming, Azai shouted loudly.

        Gritting her teeth, Nohime went back to the captain’s cabin and pulled the lever to speed up. As the boat began to chug out to sea, Azai’s figure receded into the distance

        ‘Azai! Azai!’ Oichi screamed herself hoarse, yet the only thing she could do was to watch Azai’s figure get devoured by the flock of mad men. Then, like a tower of Jenga that crumbled at the push of a finger, the whole island began to fall apart and sink into the sea.

        Quietly looking at the island where countless lives had faded, Nobunaga sent them his silent condolences…</p>
