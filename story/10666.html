        <h1>Nebula’s Threnody - Theta</h1>
        <p>        [b][i]May 21st 

        Ferdinand,  at long last, I finally made it to the Nymphalis Nebula.

        Soon, you can forever rest in peace within your beloved cosmos and sing your heart out to the nebula that has long captivated you.


        Love,
        Theta[/i][/b]

        At the spaceship dock on an inhabited planet, Theta, a female machina, stood in front of a large spacecraft with a beautifully crafted ceramic urn in her hands, preparing to board the ship. Suddenly, a rough shout halted Theta in her tracks.

        “Hold on! You can’t board the ship!” A middle-aged man rushed over, his face contorted with frustration as he stopped Theta from passing.

        “Why can’t I board? I have a reservation,” Theta composedly questioned, undeterred by the man’s impolite demeanor.

        “I didn’t know you were carrying someone’s ashes on board,” the middle-aged man glanced disdainfully at the ceramic urn in Theta’s hands, his face filled with disgust, “You’ll bring about bad luck!”

        “I mentioned it in my reservation, and your team approved it—”

        “That was an oversight on the part of my subordinates. Now that I, the captain of this spaceship, have discovered it, I don’t want you on board anymore. So, just leave. I’ll refund your money,” the captain waved his hand dismissively, trying to shoo Theta away, but she refused to comply.

        “It’s not about the money,” Theta said insistently, “The gravity level around the Nymphalis Nebula is the most stable in the coming seven days. Who knows how long I’ll have to wait if I miss this flight? You can’t just cancel my reservation.”

        “Tut! You’re so annoying!” The captain clicked his tongue in irritation. Just as he was about to scold Theta, her beauty caught his attention. Her refined and exquisite features that exuded an unattainable air of nobility ignited a malicious desire within him.

        The captain cleared his throat, putting on a pretense, and said, “Well, indeed I can let you board the ship, but if you wish to bring that thing on board, you’ll have to pay a little extra—”

        “I can pay double the price,” Theta interrupted firmly. 

        “What I’m talking about is not money,” the captain leered at Theta with a lascivious gaze and snickered. “I won’t cancel your reservation as long as you can make me happy. The ashes belong to your lover, right? Well, since he’s already dead, why not just forget about that pathetically short-lived man and have some fun with me—Argh!”

        The captain’s words were abruptly cut off by a swift and precise punch from Theta. Her punch sent him flying, crashing heavily onto the ground after drawing a trajectory.

        Meanwhile, Theta remained cold and composed, clutching the ceramic urn tightly in her hands. She glanced at the captain writhing in pain on the floor and coldly spoke, “Don’t you dare insult Ferdinand with your filthy mouth!”

        “You… You ungrateful wretch!” the captain seethed with anger and humiliation, covering his swollen cheek. He reached for his communicator in his pocket and pressed the button, and soon six young men emerged from the spacecraft.

        “Captain!”

        “Capture that girl! Show her our power as the Hungry Wolves!”

        “Aye, Captain!”The six young men responded in unison and swiftly surrounded Theta, unsheathing weapons from their waists to launch a series of attacks toward her.

        For the first several minutes, Theta still managed to hold her ground, but as the adversaries realized her determination to protect the ceramic urn, they intensified their attacks, targeting her weak points. With time passing, she began to falter. Just as she was on the verge of being struck by her opponents, someone descended from above, standing in front of Theta and blocking the incoming attacks.

        “That’s an unfair fight! Six men surrounding a girl and attacking her, are you not ashamed?” It was a charming machina girl, her delicate face filled with anger as she surveyed the aggressive young men.

        “Mind your own business and just leave, or else we’ll beat you too!” The captain glared at the girl, but she showed no fear. Instead, she grew even more infuriated.

        “You, the biggest bully who preys on vulnerable girls! As the best Guide in the universe, Scáthach, I shall bring you to justice! Now take this!” Scáthach swiftly lunged toward the captain, delivering a powerful uppercut before anyone could react. 

        “Wh-what are you all standing for? Take her down!” The captain, nursing his wounded face, roared in uncontrollable rage.

        The captain’s shout snapped his subordinates out of their daze. They quickly surrounded Scáthach only to be overwhelmed by her ferocious assault. Theta, meanwhile, did not miss the opportune moment either. She joined forces with Scáthach, launching attacks to support her. In no time, all the belligerent young men lay sprawled on the ground, clutching their limbs in pain.

        “Need another round?” Scáthach clenched her fists and menacingly waved them toward the captain who cowered and trembled. Still, he summoned some false bravery and said, “W-well, I’ll let you off the hook this time, but never again!”

        After uttering his empty threats, the captain scrambled back to his spacecraft, and the six young men, still writhing on the ground, supported each other as they clambered away from Scáthach.

        “Thank you,” Theta approached Scáthach and expressed her gratitude with a respectful bow after the thugs had left.

        “Oh! N-No need to thank me! You’re making me blush, haha,” Scáthach shyly rubbed the back of her head and then asked with a hint of confusion, “But speaking of which, why were they attacking you?”

        “It’s because…” Theta explained the circumstances to Scáthach, detailing the origin of the situation.

        “They were horrible people! They accepted your reservation and then went back on their word!” Scáthach puffed her cheeks, placing her hands on her hips and stomping her foot in deep indignation.

        “I can only blame myself for not preparing a backup plan, and now I can’t fulfill Ferdinand’s final wish,” Theta lowered her head, stoking the ceramic urn in her arms affectionately. “The elemental fluctuations around the Nymphalis Nebula are too strong for common sightseeing spacecraft to reach. Only a large-scale spaceship equipped for such conditions could make it there. But finding one now seems impossible.”

        “Don’t worry, because you’ve already found one,” Scáthach reassured her, placing her hand on Theta’s shoulder. Her almond-shaped eyes shone with excitement.

        “Huh?” Theta voiced her confusion but quickly understood what Scáthach meant. She followed Scáthach to the edge of the docking area, gazing at the massive spaceship that extended beyond the limits of her naked eye. It was three to four times larger than the one she had reserved earlier.

        “This is…your spaceship?”

        “Hehe, this is no ordinary spaceship. This is a battle cruiser that upholds universal peace,” Scáthach proudly introduced the battle cruiser to Theta as they entered. “And he’s not mine; he belongs to himself.”

        “He?”

        “Yes. Hi, I’m Montana, the battle cruiser,” a male android who suddenly materialized beside Scáthach gracefully bowed to Theta and introduced himself.

        “A battle cruiser…” Theta’s head shot up, her eyes widening as she looked at Scáthach and Montana. “So, you were part of that project…”

        Over a hundred years ago, a series of battle cruisers and their assigned Guides were created for the sake of universal security, only to be deemed too powerful and advocated for destruction. Though they managed to escape with the help of a researcher, they were subsequently hunted down and remained fugitives until recently, when the Heptara Unies overturned the decision and granted them basic rights.

        However, there were still voices in the world calling for the eradication of battlecruisers. In response, Scáthach and Montana embarked on a journey to safeguard universal security, hoping to prove their worth and change the world’s perception through their actions.

        “Yes,” Scáthach smirked jubilantly, and continued, “So, Monty and I will take you to any Nebula, whether it’s the Candy Nebula or the Cake Nebula.”

        “...It’s the Nymphalis Nebula,” Theta corrected Scáthach but then chuckled softly. The faint smile on her face further accentuated her beauty, glowing like the most noble of flowers in full bloom. “I guess I’m going with you then, thank you.”

        And so, Scáthach and Montana flew Theta through the vastness of space, traversing the dense layers of dying stars and overcoming the unstable elemental currents. Finally, they arrived at a mysterious corner of the universe, hovering above the resplendent nebula.

        “It’s beautiful…” Theta stepped onto the deck alongside Scáthach, gazing closely at the butterfly-like nebula that shone with ever-changing and dancing colorful splendor, just like a mesmerizing dream.

        “No wonder you always wished to come here. It is truly rare and breathtaking. It’s such a shame that you couldn’t see it yourself…” Theta gently caressed the ceramic urn. “But it’s okay. From now on, you can gaze upon it as long as you want.”

        “What?”  To Scáthach’s astonishment, Theta opened the ceramic urn and scattered the ashes toward the nebula, rendering her at a loss for words, “Wh-what are you doing?!”

        “It’s his last wish, so no need to be surprised,” Theta chuckled, amused by Scáthach’s overreaction, “And of course, I’m just doing my part to fulfill it.”

        “But-but… Don’t you feel sad letting him go?”

        “Yes, but death itself is not terrifying; what is truly frightening is the idea of eternal separation. However, it is an inevitable reality—one that I have known from the moment I fell in love with him, a mortal human,” Theta’s eyes sparkled with a radiant gleam as she continued, “Yet, I regret nothing. Although losing him has caused me immense pain, he has also given me joy and love, equal to… No, what he gave me has surpassed the depths of agony. And those memories will keep me going until the end of my life, and then I shall be reunited with him.”

        “But…won’t you feel lonely?”

        “I do feel lonely,” Theta admitted, her eyes fixed on the ashes that had vanished into the depths of the universe. “But whenever I feel lonely, I’ll just look up at the stars because I know he never truly left me. He’s just become a star that watches me quietly in a distant realm.”

        Though Theta spoke these words with strength, tears still escaped her control, cascading down her cheeks and blending into the boundless expanse of the universe.

        Instead of saying comforting words, Scáthach quietly embraced Theta’s delicate frame, offering condolences through the warmth of her touch…</p>
