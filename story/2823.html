        <h1>The Sun’s Guidance - Ra</h1>
        <p>        Ra was left to guard the Ancestral Elements in the shrine alone after his companions—who had created the Spiritual Civilization together—all left for their own reasons. As the Spiritual Beast tribe continued to flourish, they stopped relying on their creators that much like they used to. Fewer and fewer Spiritual Beasts would go to the shrine for Ra, and Ra also gradually disappeared from their sight.

        Then for a very long time, Ra lived in the shrine alone. One day, he met his first visitor in years—a fox Spiritual Beast. He walked into the shrine nervously; he was so nervous that he didn’t dare look up after seeing Ra.

        ‘Oh, Lord, the Almighty! My children have caught a strange disease and no doctor could help them… Lord, I ask for your mercy… Only you can save my family…’ The fox Spiritual Beast threw himself in full prostration with his forehead pressing against the icy cold floor.

        ‘Take me there.’ So Ra left the shrine and followed the fox to his house.

        However, the shocking scene behind the door stunned Ra in an instant—the cottage was covered in blood with carcasses of several young Spiritual Beasts. They were all brutally murdered; some of them were even butchered into pieces.

        In spite of the blood, Ra looked around the house to see if anyone survived. Suddenly, that fox who had asked for his help ran out of the door.

        ‘Help! Help! Ra went mad! He killed all my family! And he wants to kill me too!’

        A crowd of Spiritual Beasts came to see what had happened only to see Ra soaked in blood. Their gaze fell on Ra with different emotions—distrust and fear, which were something familiar to Ra.

        ‘My son… My lovely sons all died at the hands of a mad God… Ra has gone mad…’ The fox knelt on the ground and sobbed with grief. His moan of agony added the crowd’s credence to his words as well as their distrust of Ra.

        The Spiritual Beasts still recalled that Ra and the other Gods stood idly by without lending them a helping hand upon the Demons’ invasion back then. From that day on, the seed of suspicion had been planted in their hearts. Ever since then, they stopped relying on Gods and it turned out with a better and flourishing development of the Civilization.
　　
        ‘Why should we worship a mad God like him?!’ As the fox said, all the Spiritual Beasts before the cottage all retreated into a sullen silence.

        ‘Why should we let a mad God that kills us for fun hold the Ancestral Elements?!’ The fox let out a throaty roar at the sky.

        Ra soon knew that it was a set-up when he heard the fox saying the Ancestral Elements. “It’s another set-up for taking the Ancestral Elements.”

        Looking at the hushed beasts whose eyes were filled with distrust and fear, Ra felt drained… and disappointed. Not only was he disappointed at the beasts but also the unnecessary killings the Spiritual Beast made just to set him up.

        Just when Ra was about to speak, a werebird pushed along through the crowd and stood before him, blocking all the gaze for him.

        ‘My Lord is innocent. Those beasts all died of knife wounds. My Lord doesn’t need a knife if he truly wants to kill them.’

        The voice of the werebird sounded just and righteous with a hint of inexplicable familiarity that brought back Ra’s memory of an incident long ago. Facing a group of werewolves, a little werebird almost died for his nebulous justice just to return the stolen goods to their owners.

        Ra recalled the name of that valorous werebird—

        ‘You’re… Pluma.’

        Pluma now had become a well-known hotshot in the Spiritual Beast tribe. Hearing his words, the crowd dissolved into discussion.

        ‘Humph! What a foolish believer who still defends the mad God! I saw him butcher my sons with my own eyes! You said he didn’t need a knife to kill him! But how do you know that he didn’t use it deliberately just for fun?!’ growled the fox in anger.

        ‘If my Lord is the true murderer, how did you even escape from him and come to the street yelling for help?’ asked Pluma.

        ‘I… I… can’t… can’t tell what the mad God would do!’ Cowering, the fox subconsciously touched the necklace on his neck. The sharp-eyed Pluma immediately grabbed the necklace with his hand.

        ‘I don’t know if my Lord is mad or not but I know your necklace! I’ve seen it on the battlefield! This pattern belongs to the Demons! You’re a spy for the Demons, aren’t you?’

        The word ‘Demons’ stirred up the rage inside the Spiritual Beasts. For all those lives lost in the war against the Demons, their hatred for Demons was far deeper than their distrust of Ra. Seeing the outraged crowd, the fox fled right away.

        However, a beam of light fell from the sky and tied up the fox tightly like a belt as Ra raised one of his arms. The enraged beasts encircled the spy and dragged him away for interrogation. Yet, none of them dared to look at Ra. Soon peace was restored.

        ‘I was able to clear my name all thanks to you.’ Ra gave Pluma a smile of relief. The little bird that he had once protected now protected him.

        Perhaps it was exactly Ra’s guidance which led Pluma to a different path from the other Spiritual Beasts.

        He no longer trusted other’s words easily; instead, he made his own judgement, which eventually guided him to a path that was close to justice.

        ‘Pluma, You’ve grown up.’

        For once in a blue moon, Ra smiled. He found that he hadn’t felt such overwhelming joy for a long time ever since his companions all went out for a trip.

        “Perhaps the Spiritual Beasts just need the right amount of guidance to follow the right path.” He then returned to the shrine and started figuring out his next step.</p>
