        <h1>Rain of Reconciliation - Tefnut</h1>
        <p>
                Ever since the Spiritual bBeasts returned the Ancestral Elements, the tribe constantly strived and flourished. Soon it was the day of the harvest festival. All the Spiritual Beasts were making preparations with laughter, putting a bumper of harvest on the altar. 

        Seeing the prosperity of the civilization, Tefnut and Shu couldn’t help but sigh pleasedly, ‘they have grown and they no longer rely on us like the way they did before.’

        ‘They are already strong enough. For all these years we’ve spent in the tribe, I wonder how much the world outside has changed,’ said Shu.

        ‘How about… we go out to see the world again?’ Tefnut asked Shu softly and got her answer from the latter’s sparkling eyes.

        Together again, they embarked on a new journey. With the power of the Ancestral Elements, they disguised themselves as humans for the convenience of traveling across the human land. When they revisited some old places, they noticed the changes and started talking about their memories of the past. However, Tefnut had never thought that this trip would evoke some memories of her long-lost past.

        One day when they were walking on a street in a small town, Tefnut’s ears twitched as she heard a cat's whimper.

        ‘Meow…’ The voice was small and weak.

        ‘A cat is hurt somewhere near. Where is it?’ Tefnut soon found the source of sound from a corner of the road—a kitten was whispering for help under a wooden cart that crushed its leg.

        Tefnut wanted to go forward and help it, but someone was one step ahead of her!

        Holding the kitten in his arms, the man hurriedly walked away as if he was doing something sleazy. Shortly, his burgundy tuxedo disappeared at the end of the alley.

        ‘He looked familiar… Could it be him?’ A disturbing memory came back to her; her hands slightly quivered as though the pain and red weals caused by the whip resurfaced on her palms.

        ‘Shu, we have to follow him. I’m afraid that he may abuse that cat!’ Tefnut said.

        Following the scent drifting in the wind, Shu soon tracked the man down. They came to a residence, in which faded tent canvas and rusted cages were placed in the backyard. They heard the cat’s wail from a wooden shed so they hid behind the back door and peeped through the cracks to see what was happening inside.

        There were all kinds of tools hanging in the shed; the metal tools were shining with cold light and there was a pile of ropes and whips on the table… Tefnut knew that she was right as she recognized the patterns painted on the tools—they all belonged to the man who once whipped her again and again, the circus owner.

        Alertly, Tefnut looked at Shu, who responded to her with a nod. Then, they promptly went into the shed. Targeting the man, Tefnut attacked him with water elements.

        ‘Don’t you hurt the animals again! Shu, go and save the cat!’ said Tefnut.

        ‘Hurt? I’m curing it! Let go of me!’ That man shouted.

        ‘Curing?’ Tefnut turned and looked at the kitten that was lying on the table only to find that its injured leg had been bandaged. Yet, she still found it unbelievable so she asked, ‘why did you bandage it? You’re going to use it to make money, aren’t you… the circus owner?’

        ‘How did you know that… I’m not a circus owner anymore,’ said that man. ‘I stopped treating animals as my money maker since an animal had saved my life. They are also living beings.’

        Tefnut was startled for she was the one who saved the circus owner’s life back then.

        ‘But you walked so furtively…’ Tefnut’s voice gradually trailed off.

        ‘It would bleed to death if I didn’t walk faster——’ That man explained. Just then, the injured kitten made a grateful purring sound, as though it acknowledged what the man had said.

        Stepping forward, Tefnut held the man up and said with a nod, ‘I’ sorry. We’ve mistaken you.’ 

        Tefnut showed a genuine smile after seeing the change of her acquaintance. Those hands that used to whip her now help animals; they might look a bit wrinkled but they now seemed much more amiable.

        “It turns out that every small decision can bring about a change. Utopia might not be real but we can always make the world a little better as long as we choose rightfully.”</p>
