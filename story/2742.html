        <h1>Illusionist's Anima - Merlin</h1>
        <p>Finale of Knights of the Round Table - Ch.2

        Aria, the follower of the holy grail, gave Merlin two Star Stones. Unexpectedly, Mordred had already laid in ambush with his army for them. In the end, Lancelot was brainwashed and Arthur was seriously injured while Guinevere disguised herself as Arthur with the help of Merlin’s magic and surrendered herself to Mordred so as to help the others defuse the crisis.

        Tristan and his companions survived. After they consolidated, they decided to sneak into the palace to stop Mordred’s evil deeds. They tiptoed into the palace while Arthur was recuperating and split into three teams for operation.

        Merlin and Galahad were responsible for finding the source of dark metal and destroying it. Soon they came to the underground smithy and found Galahad’s father who was controlled by dark metal. Yet, Morgan le Fay intervened in their rescue. Merlin stepped forward to hold Morgan le Fay back so that Galahad could go and find her father.

        'Humph, you think you little rat can stop me?' Purple airstream rose from Morgan le Fay’s hand and formed into clones, ringing Merlin. As they drew small circles with their fingers, the purple airstream on their fingertips converged into daggers and darted towards Merlin!

        'Argh!' Merlin unfolded elements to defend but the attack was too intensive that her arms and legs were cut. Blood splattered.

        'How dare you rats try to sabotage my son’s plan. Unforgivable! I have to teach you a lesson!' Morgan le Fay flashed an enthralling smile.

        “There are so many clones. How can I even deal with them? That’s unfair!” Blocking the attacks, Merlin kept stepping back. Only until she hit the stone wall behind her did she realize she had been cornered in the smithy.

        'Tut-tut, is this the end——'

        “No, there’s still a way…” A wispy voice broke into Merlin’s mind. She recognized the voice immediately and called out a name in astonishment, “the follower of the holy grail… Aria.”

        “Yes, it’s me. Everyone has his or her weakness, including Morgan le Fay...”

        “Weakness...” Recalling what Morgan le Fay had just said, Merlin quivered and soon cracked a sly smile. As she raised her wand and conjured magic power, a blinding light draped over her, making her figure unclear for a moment.

        'Still trying to fight? It’s useless——' As Morgan le Fay raised her hand, all the clones conjured magic and aimed at Merlin. When they were just about to attack, a slender figure stepped out of the light.

        'Mother, are you really gonna kill me?' Merlin questioned Morgan le Fay with the appearance of Mordred.

        'My son… Mordred… No!' Merlin’s move shook Morgan le Fay successfully. All the attacks of the clones missed and scattered around Merlin, who certainly seized the moment. As she dispelled the illusion, she conjured power and threw an energy sphere at the true Morgan le Fay.

         Morgan le Fay retracted her clones at the very last minute and changed the power into an elemental shield to resist Merlin’s attacks. Unfortunately, she wasn’t able to resist them all that she staggered back as she got hit. 

        'Urg——! You—— how dare you use such a despicable trick!' Morgan le Fay glared at Merlin with grinding teeth.

        'Humph! It’s nothing despicable! Are you saying that only your son is precious and the others are just worthless?!' Merlin glowered back at her with no signs of fear, 'Do you have any idea of how many families were broken because of you and your precious little boy!? You are such a thick skin to call me despicable!'

        'Every great thing comes with sacrifices. They should be honored that they could help my son! '

        'You——unreasonable!' Merlin was choked with rage. She raised her wand again and conjured magic power again. A blazing golden light flew towards Morgan le Fay.

        'Humph!' Morgan le Fay resisted with her power. A gust of ominous purple air billowed and attacked the golden light——

        Two magic powers collided! Instantly, a dazzling light burst out with mountainous shock waves. The purple air got the upper hand within a short while and kept swallowing the golden light.

        'Darn it! I will not succumb!' Putting up with the pain and pressure, Merlin struggled to hold her body straight. Suddenly, a refreshing breath of water floated in and wrapped Merlin, alleviating her physical pain.

        “The staunch sorcerer… Let me help you…”

        'Tut! The follower of the holy grail, how dare you get in my way!' Morgan le Fay lost her usual poise and her enchanting face was distorted.

        'Get lost!' Merlin shouted lowly as she forced out all the magic power in her body, releasing a dawning light that covered the entire smithy.

        'Cough… I will get you for this next time...' Morgan le Fay, who had consumed a lot of magic power, lay on the ground, panting. With her remaining magic power, she cast a spell, turned herself into a purple mist and fled.

        Merlin couldn’t chase after her. Yet, behind her came the voices of Galahad and her father...</p>
