        <h1>Paladin Queen of Water - Madeleine</h1>
        <p>        In a desolate valley, Madeleine the maiden was tied to a stone pillar. She was a princess whose kingdom was invaded by the Demons not long ago. Although the Queen successfully repelled the enemy with her army, they took Madeleine away and held her captive.

        Leading her army, the Queen tried to rescue Madeleine but her soldiers were gravely wounded after running into the Demons’ ambush several times. Luckily, the Queen broke through the Demons’ siege with a small troop of cavalry and finally came to the valley standing in front of her.

        The Queen, of all people, was fully aware that there would certainly be countless traps in the valley ahead of her. But for the sake of her daughter, she led the army forward, come what may. Along the way, the Queen was frazzled and covered with scars; her armor was also heavily stained with blood and mud.

        Just then, a volley of arrows came at the Queen and her cavalry from the top of the mountain. When the arrows were about to hit the Queen, she activated the power of the Azure Armor and fended off the arrows in mid-air with a water wall.

        Seeing the arrows flop in vain,  a swarm of Demon soldiers rushed down towards the Queen and her cavalry. Riding her horse, the Queen led the charge with her eyes locked on the shackled Madeleine.

        Commanding the water to form an airtight shield, the Queen protected the vanguard. Just when she reached Madeleine, a loud bang came from the ground, followed by a mountainous shock wave that almost wrecked the entire valley.

        It turned out that the Demon leader, who had been hiding on the summit, detonated the dynamite buried in the valley, trying to entomb all the lives there—including those of his comrades. In the nick of time when the blast was about to sweep away all living creatures, the Queen evoked all the power that remained on her armor and protected everyone.

        The valley was thrown into complete shambles after the explosion. Yet, all the cavalry survived by dint of the Queen’s protection.

        Holding her sobbing daughter tightly in her arms, the Queen consoled her softly and said, ‘Now we can… go home…’
　　
        However, just when the Queen intended to take Madeleine and leave, an arrow darted towards the latter from a distance. The alerted Queen pushed Madeleine away at the very last moment while the arrow ripped through her chest.

        Only till then did the Demon troopers reveal themselves slowly, assaulting the survivors with mocking laughter.  Although Madeleine was saved from the arrow, her face was deeply gashed by the gravel as she was pushed to the ground and blood kept oozing from her wound with burning pain.

        However, she didn’t have the time to ease her pain. She held the Queen’s body in her arms with tears pouring down her face.  Resenting her own incompetence, she was tired of being weak that she didn’t want her loved ones to die because of her again.

        “I killed my mother… If only I was stronger, I wouldn’t be imprisoned by the Demons… I don’t want to be a burden anymore!”

        Feeling Madeleine’s determination, the Queen’s armor turned into a current of water and draped around her. Then, a voice that she was very familiar with sounded in her heart.

        “There, there… I’ll always protect you.”

        A Demon soldier went to the back of Madeleine with a sword in his hand ready to slash, yet Madeleine stopped him onehanded. As the combat techniques of the past Paladin Queen of Water kept flooding into her mind, she conjured a water blade in her palm and stabbed the Demon in the chest after a twirl of the sword.

        She then took the sword and the giant shield of the Queen. Like a stream of water, she danced swimmingly on the battlefield, bringing an enemy down with each swing of her sword.

        Madeleine slew every Demon in the valley, whose blood smeared all over her armor and painted it red. She then carried the Queen’s body in her arms and left the valley, lurching back to their kingdom.</p>
