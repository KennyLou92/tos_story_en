        <h1>Afire Love - Meng Huo</h1>
        <p>        As the peace treaty with the 3rd elder brother failed, Meng Huo and Sun Ce returned to their base camp in great disappointment, for they realized wars were inevitable for the moment.

        Zhurong was studying documents when they entered.  Meng Huo immediately showed his concern over her situation.  “Dear, are you feeling better?”

        “Yes, I'm.” Zhurong took a glance at him before she focused on the documents again.  “How's the negotiation going,” she asked.

        “Ah...I messed up.”

        “No, it's not your fault.  All because of the enemy——”

        “The enemy's general is your elder brother. Am I right?” Zhurong cut in casually as she put down the documents to look at Meng Huo.

        Stunned, he lowered his voice.  “How...how did you know that?”

        “After you two set out towards the negotiation, I've investigated the death of all your brothers.  Among all, no one has ever seen the dead body of your 3rd elder brother.”

        Zhurong continued as she took a sip of tea.  “Then I sent people to interrogate your brother's general, and found out that your 3rd brother's wife killed all soldiers in the jail and saved your injured 3rd elder brother out during the storm.  No one would have expected he could survive the night, so they didn't bother to send anyone but assumed he was already dead.”

        “I see.” Sun Ce admired her perspicacity to figure out the truth within limited time.

        “Your 3rd elder brother is a legitimate heir to the throne of Nanman.  That's why Cao Cao was willing to give him soldiers.”

        “Dear, sorry that I couldn't make a deal with my brother...” Meng Huo blamed himself, clenching his own fists.  At the moment, Zhurong reached out to cover his hands.

        “No worries.  The moment we know the enemy is your brother, the victory is ours.”

        “Em?  What do you mean, my dear?” Meng Huo was confused.

        Zhurong wore a confident smile to answer.  “Even though he has the legitimate bloodline, it doesn't mean he is competent enough to take over the tribe.  If the opponent is your 3rd elder brother, beating him is just a piece of cake.”

        As she expected, his 3rd elder brother was inept at wars and strategies.  Zhurong took less than a day to crush their force——

        First, she sent a group of weak soldiers to lure the enemies into a narrow mountain path. After they all got in, ambushes on the both hillsides detonated the dynamites to cause a landslide, blocking the way in and out.  Then, fire arrows were shot to burn all the enemies to death as they were completely cornered. A cruel slaughter didn’t stop until dusk.

        Zhurong, Sun Ce and Meng Huo passed through a tunnel to the front of his 3rd elder brother.  Despite soldiers' protection, he was severely injured facing the harsh attack of Zhurong.  His right arm and left leg were completely mutilated.  When his 3rd elder brother saw Meng Huo, he curried favor immediately.

        “Younger brother, it's my fault.  I shouldn't have listened to Cao Cao.  Please, show mercy.”

        “Brother...” Meng Huo showed pity towards him.  “But sorry, I can't.”

        “...You bastards!  Even if I die, I won't forgive you all!  I curse you——” His elder brother's curses were cut off by Zhurong’s blade.  As a result, he died with unwillingness and fury.

        Looking at the grievous Meng Huo, Zhurong comforted him calmly.  “The royal bloodline has been eliminated, except you.  From now on, wars are not necessary anymore.”

        “Right…” Meng Huo closed his eyes; a tear dropped down his face.

        Afterwards, the three led the army to the base camp of the 3rd elder brother, to capture the remaining soldiers and confiscate all useful resources back to the tribe.  During which, a soldier reported of a secret passage nearby.  Therefore, they carried a group of soldiers to the end of the passage.

        “Is it...an interrogation room?” Sun Ce frowned as he looked into the black stains on the wall.  “Ew...what a quirk.”

        “Someone ahead.” Zhurong hardly saw a figure, chained and curled up at the corner.  The person sat up straight as she heard noises.

        “Zhaojun!”

        Wang Zhaojun opened her swollen eyes but was shocked.   “Brother...Why you...where is my husband?”

        “He died.” Zhurong gave her a cold stare.  “I killed him.”

        “Is that so...” Zhaojun lowered her head to mumble, not sure if it was a sorrow or relief to her.  “Then you're gonna kill his wife, aren't you?”

        “Dear...” Meng Huo implored Zhurong to show mercy.

        This reminded her of the first encounter with Zhaojun.  “Suit yourself,” she heaved a sigh.

        Pleased, Meng Huo unlocked her chains right away.  Wang Zhaojun rubbed her arms but carried a strange intention in her eyes.  Next second——

        She pulled off the hairpin and sprinted towards Zhurong's back with great speed to pierce——

        “Ah!”

        Knowing that Meng Huo was stabbed to bleed by protecting herself, Zhurong's fury erupted.  She thrust her blade into Zhaojun's abdomen with no hesitation and kicked her away.

        “Husband,” Zhurong asked worriedly.

        “Just a scratch...Brughh!” Meng Huo tried to soothe her anxiety, but a surge of blood was spat out unbearably.

        “The hairpin...is poisonous!” Sun Ce checked on his blackened wound.

        “Hehe...bingo.” Wang Zhaojun gasped for breath.  “Cao Cao gave me.  It contained lethal toxic inside.  You could never save him!  Never!  Now I've avenged my husband!  HAHAHA——”

        Laughing like a lunatic, Wang Zhaojun gasped her life out.  Zhurong could not care less but to pull out the hairpain at once.  However, it did not help much as the toxins had already spread in Meng Huo's vein.

        “...Never expected I would die in this way...” The burning hot within kept engulfing his consciousness.  Maintaining his gaze at Zhurong who was anxious to call a doctor for help, Meng Huo put on a peaceful smile.  “At least I can protect her...”

        “Dear, sorry that I couldn’t watch over you any longer...” Meng Huo spoke gently as he touched her face.”

        “Doctor is coming.  You're gonna be fine.” Zhurong panted for breath as she held Meng Huo's hands.  She might be seemingly pacifying him, but instead she was trying to persuade herself.

        Meng Huo shook his head, with no fear even at the edge of death.  The only thing he was worried about was leaving Zhurong behind.  

        “Dear, promise me.  Don't lose your sanity even if I’m not here with you...”

        “No, I must save you!” Rarely Zhurong made such a hysteric scream.

        “Sun Ce...I'm counting on you to take care of her...” Meng Huo was too weak to talk anymore; Sun Ce, at the very moment, crouched down, held his hands and accepted the request in sincerity.

        “Thank you...” Then, he closed his eyes slowly, letting off his hands on Zhurong's cheeks.  Holding the cold body of her own husband, Zhurong had a burst of outrage in her heart——

        “Cao Cao...This is what you've been planning with that woman since the beginning...” Razor-sharp feelings of heartache became rampant; waves of bitter remorse had made her mind collapse. The moment when Meng Huo was gone, no one in the world could keep Zurong sane anymore.

        “You'll pay for this!  I must kill you for vengeance!”</p>
