        <h1>Flames of Divine Order - Ke Hun</h1>
        <p>A Runedragon.
The Chief of the Starmage’s Wellings branch.

He is a great Mage with the title of “Ace of Coins ”.
He can cast magic formulas with up to five layers, but mostly enchantments and defensive magic. He often uses small and exquisite hidden weapons as his means of attack because they are convenient and easy to use.
He has a slack and casual personality. As he doesn't like working, he always asks He Jin, the Deputy Chief, to run errands for him.
For some reason, he has given Hua Jin, his Souliade, the silent treatment for over a hundred years.
Considering the strenuous effort to transform himself into a human adult and the favorable popularity of a boy’s appearance, he chooses a human boy’s appearance for his human form.</p>
