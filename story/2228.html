        Minerelves’ Record Story Ch. 15

        Inside an isolated country, there nurtured a special sort of elves. The species was called minerelf, for their body structure consisted of jewels. The nation gradually thrived under the king’s rule, and this story began at the thriving age…

        Emerald, a chubby girl, was cleaning a magic-practice room with a bloom, but her face looked so pale right now.

        “I’m starving...but I haven’t finished the duty...Gotta speed up…” Emerald had been busy since this morning without having breakfast. Despite her fatigue caused by starvation, she forced her body to work.

        Yet nothing good came from pressure. Eventually a strong dizziness hit Emerald. When everything was spinning in her sight, she fell as her body lost balance——

        Before Emerald’s head kissed the floor, Diamond the silver-haired “girl” caught her with a pair of gloved hands.

        “Hey. Are you alright?” Diamond spoke to Emerald in concern, but her consciousness was clouded by hunger.

        “This ice-cream looks delicious...Just let me have a small bite.” Through her blurry vision, Emerald confused Diamond’s glittering arm as ice-cream, which made her take a bite.

        “Whoa——!” 

        Without seeing this coming, the startled Diamond let go of Emerald, dropping her onto the ground; yet the momentum brought Emerald back to reality.

        “Huh? W-What happened to me?” Emerald asked as she looked at Diamond, who knelt on the floor while covering his mouth. She blushed as she recalled what had happened, bowing at Diamond to apologise.

        “I’m so sorry. That’s just too rude.”

        “...N-Nevermind,” said Diamond while suppressing the raging nausea, which happened whenever he made body contact with girls.

        The truth was that “she” was in fact a he. The exquisite, gorgeous Diamond was an authentic boy. For some reasons, he had to disguise his gender and study at Minerelf Girls’ School.

        When the nausea had eased, Diamond asked Emerald kindly, “are you alright? You look so pale——”

        The loud stomach growling had answered Diamond and embarrassed Emerald as well.

        “...I’ve got my lunch box here. Please eat it if you don’t mind,” said Diamond as he offered his lunch to Emerald. Although her mind said it wasn’t an appropriate thing to do so, her body responded honestly to the tasty food inside the box.

        “Nom nom...this is tasty...Delicious…” As Emerald gulfed the food, she felt tremendously delightful and satisfied.

        A smile appeared on Diamond’s face, who felt Emerald’s joy too. Curiosity triggered his question, “why only you do the cleaning? I thought the student handbook said that the duty must be done by 5 students together…”

        Just when Emerald was about to answer, 4 students came into the room together, who seemed not some kind of nice elves.

        “We were just wondering why haven’t you been back. Turns out you’re slacking off here,” said the leading short-haired girl.

        “I-I’m sorry. She gave me food because I was about to faint.” 

        Emerald tried to explain with a smile, but the girl didn’t buy it.

        “While you were well-fed, we were still waiting for you to get us lunch.”

        “Look at you, selfish and boring. No wonder no elves would hang out with you.”

        “Exactly. You would be all alone if we didn’t pity you and be your friends.”

        The 4 of them started giggling after being mean to Emerald.

        “Shut up!” Diamond yelled as he couldn’t sit back.

        The leading girl was intimidated to step back by Diamond, but she refused to compromise in front of her peers. 

        “W-Who are you? This is the business between us, not yours,” said the girl, forcing herself to face Diamond.

        “S-She does it on her own will. No one’s forcing her!” The girls kept finding excuses.

        “I-It’s true. No one forces me. Don’t be like that,” Emerald begged Diamond while pulling his sleeve, but Diamond remained his attitude.

        “Apologize, now.” Diamond said word by word, making his words sounded even tougher.

        “...Alright. S-Sorry. Is it what you want?” 

        The girls eventually bent to Diamond’s scowl. They apologized while staring at Emerald.

        “We’ll never ever talk to her again.”

        The girls fled as fast as they could to avoid Diamond snapping again.

        “These elves are bullies. If this happens again, don’t back down ‘cause they’ll keep pushing at you...W-Why are crying?”

        Turning around, Diamond saw the tearful Emerald, staring at him in pout.

        “Y-You ruined everything!”</p>
