        <h1>Deduction Before Dessert - Agatha</h1>
        <p>
                On a sunny afternoon in Verdilles, a kingdom located in the western Tarones, a young lady, clothed in a gorgeous dress, strolled down the street gracefully with a parasol in her hands under the cloudless sky. However, her upright posture crumbled as she suddenly stopped and bent after a few steps, as if compelled by an invisible force.

        “Oh Lord… Why is the weather so unbearably hot today… The hateful sun…” the girl named Agatha lamented through gritted teeth, her brow beaded with glistening sweat. She dabbed at it with a handkerchief as she peered ahead the distorted streets in the steaming heat, doubt beginning to creep into her heart.

        ‘Perhaps I should head back home and then lie in my chair and ask the butler to serve me…’

        “No! I cannot give up like this!” Agatha vigorously shook her head, her fists clenched tightly. “I’m here with a purpose; how could I return empty-handed? The butler will surely make fun of me… I must taste the new dessert, no matter what!”

        While Agatha was still fighting with her inner struggle, she unknowingly caught the attention of some passersby. One gentleman, in particular, approached with concern, “Are you alright, little girl? Are you feeling unwell? Where are your parents? Let me assist you in finding them.”

        At the sound of his inquiry, Agatha immediately controlled the emotions on her face and straightened her posture. Demonstrating nobility and grace from head to toe, she composedly replied, “Thank you, Sir, but may I remind you that I am not a little girl; I am a distinguished lady.” 

        With a slight nod toward the bewildered gentleman, she gracefully walked away. However, her resolved stride crumbled again after a dozen steps. It was after a dozen times of pausing and resuming that she finally arrived at a lovely coffee shop.

        “F-finally… I made it…” Agatha’s face lit up with joy. She quickened her steps to push open the door and step inside.

        The wind chime hanging on the door jingled as Agatha entered, capturing the attention of a young female pastry chef. She peeked out from the kitchen and exclaimed in surprise, “Aggy, you’re here!”

        “Yes, I heard you’ve created a new dessert, so I thought I would drop by to taste it,” Agatha casually remarked with a nonchalant expression, striving to maintain an aloof demeanor despite her heightened excitement.

        “No problem, I’ll prepare it for you right away— Oh, I have a phone call, please excuse me.”

        The phone suddenly rang and interrupted the pastry chef’s words. She turned to answer the phone, speaking only a few words before exclaiming vehemently, “WHAT? The golden bowl left by Father is missing? …Calm down, I’m coming back now to help you find it!”

        ‘Oh no… This is not good…’ Agatha, who had been eavesdropping on the conversation, felt a sense of foreboding. True to her premonition,  the pastry chef, after hanging up the phone, looked apologetically at her and said, “I’m sorry, but something urgent has come up at my mother’s house. I need to go now. I’ll make the dessert for you another day.”

        ‘No… No, that won’t do. I went through all the trouble leaving home; I even endured the awful heat just to taste the new dessert. I can’t let it all go to waste!’ Agatha relentlessly pondered. Ultimately, her reluctance to return home empty-handed overshadowed her initial goal of tasting the new dessert.

        “I’ll go with you!” Agatha shouted.

        “Huh?”

        “I am a detective recognized by the palace. Finding a lost item is a piece of cake for me. Trust me, taking me with you will only do you good,” said Agatha, retrieving a royal emblem from her pocket. The dazzling gleam of the emblem further strengthened Agatha’s argument, and finally, the pastry chef agreed to her request.

        And so, the pastry chef took Agatha back to her parents’ house—a country estate with a garden on the outskirts.

        By the time they arrived, a woman was already waiting by the door. She walked forward upon seeing the pastry chef, along with Agatha holding an umbrella, she inquired with curiosity, “May I ask who is this...?”

        “Um… She’s a friend of mine. She offered to help after knowing about the missing bowl at our house.”

        “That’s so kind of you,” the woman said bashfully.

        “Not at all,” Agatha shook her head, “Madam, could you show us where the item went missing?”

        “Of course,” The woman quickly led the pastry chef and Agatha to the study on the first floor. 

        It was a square-shaped study, with two half-length windows on the wall opposite the door, offering a view of the garden outside. Sunlight streamed through the closed windows and fell on the desk placed against the wall, upon which lay a few metal tools.

        “I took the things out of the warehouse to clean them this morning after seeing the fine weather. I placed the golden bowl on the desk and left it in the sunlight to rid it of dampness. Then, I left the study to water the flowers in the garden, and when I returned, the bowl was nowhere to be found.”

        “Could someone have come in and taken it?”

        The woman hesitantly shook her head, “I made sure to lock all the windows and the door when I left the study. I also used the key when I returned, so no one should have been able to enter before I did… Sigh, the golden bowl is a family heirloom left by your father. We must find it at all costs.” 

        “Humph! It wouldn’t have gone missing if you didn’t take it out of the warehouse and place it in the sunlight in the first place,” a man’s voice came from the doorway. Agatha looked over and saw a sly-looking young man standing there.

        “It’s not your place to speak here!” The pastry chef’s face darkened upon seeing the young man, her tone turning stern. “Maybe you stole the bowl to pay off your debts.”

        “I-I didn’t take it!” The hint of guilt in the young man’s defense only further convinced the pastry chef of her judgment.

        “So you did take it! Give it back now!”

        “I swear I didn’t take it! Just because you’re my elder sister doesn’t mean you can accuse me of something I didn’t do!” The young man’s frustration at the pastry chef’s suspicion grew apparent as he clenched his fists. Tension mounted between the two. Even though the woman frantically attempted to mediate, yet there seemed to be no sign of resolution between the siblings.

        While the situation escalated, Agatha remained undeterred. She surveyed the study—the windows, the desk, the sofa beside it, the tall cabinet next to the sofa, the footstool in front of the cabinet, the bright yellow petals on the footstool, the fallen book on the footstool, the door, the bookshelf beside it, the narrow transom window above the door, the lock on the door…

        Closing her eyes, Agatha let her thoughts race in the darkness, gathering all the details and clues until they were woven into a picture, the truth behind the incident.

        “I know where the golden bowl is,” Agatha announced as she opened her eyes and held her head high, turning toward the quarrelsome siblings.

        “What?”
        “Where?”
        The siblings simultaneously stopped glaring at each other and asked Agatha eagerly.

        “Follow me,” Agatha led the three out of the study and into the outdoors. Her action aroused suspicions in the young man.

        “How are we going to find the bowl outside the house? Just say you have no idea where the bowl is. Don’t try to fool us, little girl. I’ll make sure you learn a hard lesson if we end up not finding the bowl. I’m warning you because I know a lot of people—” The young man’s rambling was silenced by a sharp look from Agatha, who exuded a presence far beyond that of a mere child at a fleeting moment.

        “...Here it is,” Agatha said confidently. Looking at the greenhouse in front of them, the pastry chef hesitated, “You’re saying that the golden bowl is inside the greenhouse?”

        “That’s right, and I believe the thief is in there as well,” Agatha pushed open the door to the greenhouse, a refreshing cool breeze greeting them as they entered.

        Agatha looked around the interior before walking toward a corner of the greenhouse filled with vibrant yellow roses, where she stopped and parted the lush foliage with her hands.

        “Just as I thought,” Agatha said, looking at the newborn kitten nestled inside the golden bowl with a small smile playing on her lips.

        The mother cat hissed warily. Agatha immediately relaxed her grip on the foliage lest she provoke the mother cat.

        “It seems like you’ll have to wait until the kittens are a little bit older before you can retrieve the golden bowl.”

        “It’s okay; the most important thing is that we’ve found it,” the woman said, breathing a sigh of relief. She grasped Agatha’s hand with a grateful smile spreading across her face, “You’re truly amazing. How did you figure out that the cat took it?”

        “Well, since the study was locked, there were only a few possibilities,” Agatha explained, “There were smudges on the transom window above the door and a fallen book beside the footstool with yellow petals left on it. All of these indicate the presence of a non-human intruder.”

        “Indeed. Given the scorching weather for the past few days, it’s likely that the mother cat had already taken a liking to this temperature-controlled greenhouse. She found a container and used it as the bed for her newly born children; the golden bowl just happened to be her choice,” the pastry chef continued following Agatha’s deduction.

        “Heh, didn’t someone insist that I must have stolen it?” the young man taunted his sister resentfully.

        The pastry chef, realizing her misjudgment, had no choice but to stifle her rebuttal in embarrassment.

        “You may not have stolen the golden bowl, but you certainly have stolen something,” Agatha stated calmly, dropping a bombshell in the room.

        “That’s ridiculous! I-I didn’t steal anything!”

        “Is that so? Then empty your pockets and let the truth speak itself.”

        “I-I’m not doing that because I didn’t steal— Hey! What are you doing?” The young man refused to empty his pockets, but the pastry chef did not relent; she reached in and found several pieces of women’s jewelry. 

        “That is my dowry…” the woman who recognized the jewelry immediately turned and looked at her son in disbelief.

        “He sneaked into the study before you brought out the golden bowl. He searched the entire room, looking for your dowry. He even moved the footstool so that he could search the top shelf. However, he had to leave in a hurry because you returned to the study to place the bowl in the sunlight, which is also why he didn’t have the time to restore the scene,” Agatha explained with a disdainful look toward the young man. “He should have planned to sell the jewelry today, but he hurried back as he saw you back in the estate, fearing that he would be caught.”

        “H-How did you know?”

        “How?” Agatha raised her head proudly and said, “Because I am the most exceptional lady.”

        Afterward, the pastry chef gave her brother a stern lecture. In gratitude toward Agatha, she personally treated Agatha with her new dessert. It was after Agatha devoured three plates in one go that she left the house with a full belly.

        As soon as she stepped outside, she spotted a carriage waiting at the gate, beside which stood a dignified old gentleman in immaculate butler attire. The old man respectfully bowed and said as he saw Agatha, “I never thought Miss Agatha would actually leave the house alone. It seems that desserts indeed hold a great allure for children—”

        “I am NOT a child!” Agatha’s eyes widened, resembling the ones of an irritated cat. The butler, noticing her reaction, chuckled lightly before composing himself. “Of course, Miss Agatha is an exceptional lady, and it is a lady’s virtue to be punctual.”

        “...Tut!” Agatha clicked her tongue, displeased. “Fine, I’ll go.”

        “Please,” The butler opened the carriage door. Agatha lifted her skirts as she stepped into the carriage. Then they headed toward the palace at the invitation of the King.</p>
