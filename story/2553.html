        <h1>Spiky Aroma - Amor & Celos</h1>
        <p>
                Since Diarmuid’s return, Amor and Celos thought that they could finally regain their long-waited lives in which the three of them lived and fought together. They were Diarmuid’s most loyal listeners. That night when their master was recounting his past in the woods, their minds were also taken back to those days…

        Watching Diarmuid and Isabel dance under the vault of fireflies, Amor smiled and told her little sister that she felt like the two were dancing in the stars. Unexpectedly, her words displeased Celos.

        ‘The starry sky is a memory shared only among Master and us. No one can take it away, not even if she is Master’s lover.’

        Looking at her little sister beside her, Amor pinched her face. ‘So you’re jealous now, huh? We should be happy for Master, for he has found his happiness.’ Celos, who buttoned her lips, just leaned her head against her sister’s shoulder. Together the sisters quietly watched the two figures under the milky way…

        Later, Diarmuid and Isabel rested in the shade of a tree. Leaning closely to each other, Diarmuid told her that he saw the two lances as both his listeners and his daughters.

        ‘It’s stupid, isn’t it? It’s just like I’m talking to myself.’

        ‘Of course not. Just as I can hear the elves talking, you must be able to hear them since they mean a lot to you.’

        After hearing her answer, Diarmuid flashed a smile of relief. Isabel was the only person that believed him. Even though Isabel could not see the sisters, she would still try to talk to them while polishing the lances, which made Amor and Celos realize that the woman before them was different.

        Yet, Isabel accidentally cut herself and left drops of blood on the tip of the lance. Seeing the distressed expression on Diarmuid’s face, Celos finally understood what Amor meant. She then gave her sister a nod to show her recognition for this woman in front of her. As the two sisters channeled their powers, the lances gleamed with two voices that Isabel could hear—

        ‘Since you’re the love of Master, then we shall do our utmost to protect you!’</p>
