        <h1>Celestial Divinity - Yuanshi Tianzun</h1>
        <p>
                Summoned by Yuanshi Tianzun, the Xian were assembling in a palace of the Heavenly Kingdom, waiting for him to host the meeting.  A stream of water surged into the palace and dissolved into a human form gradually——Yuanshi Tianzun showed up in front of them.
        “The realm is in chaos, which must have something done with the Gods...Zeus is as sly as a fox.  Now that the power of 12 Zodiacs was scattered, confronting Zeus has become more difficult than ever.  That’s why I’m here to ask for your advice,” Yuanshi Tianzun looked at the Xian from the stage.
        A Xian came up and bowed to him before speaking.  “Tianzun, we need a powerful Xian to help those Zodiacs in secret.”
        “It sounds a good idea!  Who is the most suitable choice,” Yuanshi Tianzun asked. 
        “I would suggest Changxi and Jiang Shang.  Both of them are capable,” the Xian responded.
        Another Xian walked towards Yuanshi Tianzun and said, “I think Shen Gongbao is also a good option.”
        The Xian started droning on about the candidates they wanted to recommend.  However, Yuanshi Tianzun remained silent and pondered for a while, because he knew they were not the best choice...Suddenly, a flash of a figure swept across his mind.  Then, he raised his hand to put an end to the arguments.  “Changxi, bring your third eldest uncle here.”
        Changxi did not feel shocked at all when Tianzun mentioned her uncle.  She nodded and walked out of the palace.
        As soon as Taishang Laojun arrived, all of the Xian had laid their focus on him, but he did not care about it.
        “How may I help you?”
        “Brother, I need you to do me a favor.  No one here is more suitable than you.”
        “I’m all ears.”
        After Yuanshi Tianzun explained the matter they discussed in the meeting, Taishang Laojun promised to help without any hesitation.
        “I should go to the Zodiacs now.”
        “Very well.  We’re counting on you.”
        He turned around and left; Yuanshi Tianzun followed him with his glance. 
        “Only you can help me.  I wish you a fair wind.”
        At this moment, Taishang Laojun winked at him, as if he could feel Tianzun’s mind.  “I’ll finish the task.  I promise.” Then, his figure vanished into thin air. 
        As the Xian dismissed, there were only Yuanshi Tianzun and Changxi left in the palace.  He gazed at the blue sky outside, without saying a word.  
        “Why my uncle?” 
        “We’ll see.” Yuanshi Tianzun paused and continued, “He is the best choice.” 
        His eyes lingered over the view.  When it came to the Gods, he could not help but think of Giemsa and Phoenix…</p>
