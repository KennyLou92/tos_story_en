        <h1>Blossoming Heart - Sakura</h1>
        <p>Finale of Elfish Perennials - Ch.7

        On the day of the Century Feast, Sakura came out of a deep coma with Rose’s help. The two hurried to Blossomville to save the Mother Tree as soon as they sensed that she was in danger.

        When they arrived at Blossomville, the Mother Tree was already engulfed in dark purple flames. Surrounding the Mother Tree like high walls, the eerie flames were so strong that the fire did not die down a bit even though the soldiers had been pouring water over it.

        “This… They’ve crossed the line… The Mother Tree will die in flames and the entire kingdom… No! I have to stop the fire and protect the Mother Tree!”

        Sakura clenched her hands into tight fists. All of a sudden, she decisively grabbed a water bucket from one of the soldiers and poured all the water onto herself. Then she dashed through the walls of flames and ran to the Mother Tree without saying a word. Her action was totally unexpected, leaving Rose and the soldiers no time to stop her but to watch her disappear into the sea of flames.

        “It’s so hot… It feels like my whole body is going to dry...”

        It was hot in the sea of flames. The steaming heat coming from all directions scorched every inch of Sakura’s body. Even her breaths were burning. The water that she had poured on her body evaporated in just a short moment.

        Sakura, who nearly fainted from suffocation in the fire, hurriedly bit her lip to retain her consciousness with pain. Holding the guardian’s staff, she mustered her power to break the fire and create a path to the Mother Tree.

        She hobbled down the path step by step using the staff as a walking stick. Suddenly, she heard a horrifying sound above her head—a thick burning branch snapped because of the fire, falling straight to where Sakura was standing!

        ‘I have to dodge it… Argh!’ As much as Sakura wanted to pounce forward to avoid the falling branch, her legs had dried up because of the heat. Unable to make a jump, she could only fall to the ground and watch the falling branch get closer to her—

        In the nick of time, a flash of golden light appeared and turned into a translucent figure who blocked the branch!


        Sakura recognized the figure at a glance. With her eyes widening in surprise, she shouted excitedly, ‘Teacher!’

        “Sakura, don’t give up. I have faith in you… I’m waiting for you under the Mother Tree…” While Mysorensis’s tender words echoed in Sakura’s head, her figure slowly faded away and eventually disappeared into the flames, leaving the young guardian alone.

        “Teacher… I won’t let you down!” Pulling herself together, Sakura propped herself up with the staff and walked toward the path that Mysorensis had created for her.

        Despite the tormenting heat, the scorching tongues of flames that touched her face, and her charred feet, Sakura did not stop. Finally, she made it to an unburning corner before the Mother Tree where Mysorensis breathed her last.

        Sakura’s body and heart shuddered when she saw Mysorensis’ body. Although she had known that Mysorensis was dead, it was still a heartbreaking and inconceivable truth for her to take in. Grief swept over her like a tide and cut her heart like a dagger, filling her eyes with tears.

        Sakura tried her best to fight back her tears because she was on an important mission. She simply walked to her teacher and gently held her hand.

        “I will protect the Mother Tree for you so please rest in peace, teacher. I will not run away from my responsibility again.”

        After saying her last goodbye to Mysorensis, Sakura walked to the Mother Tree and put her hand on the trunk while raising the staff. As she channeled her power into the staff, countless illuminating dust surged and swirled around her, flooding her thoughts and pushing the scorching heat away from her mind. She closed her eyes. In the darkness she saw countless sparkles flying up——

        She became one with the Mother Tree; she saw Blossomville, the whole kingdom, the entire Tarones, and then she learned the truth.

        “I see… The gluttonous gods want to take the elements as their own and that is what makes the Mother Tree weak and dampens her light…” Sakura closed her eyes in sorrow. 

        “There are only two choices left for me now: I either use my power to extinguish the flames and keep the Mother Tree alive, or I sacrifice the Mother Tree, release her power to give every floral-elves our mother’s last blessing and then find new opportunities for the kingdom.”

        In a dilemma, Sakura began rubbing her fingers unconsciously. She did not know which choice was the correct one. As the guardian, saving the Mother Tree should be her first priority; however, what would the floral-elves’ future be if she chose the Mother Tree? .

        “I don’t know what is the right decision. Bad things may happen if I make the wrong choice again just like the last time. Am I really capable of making the right choice…”

        Suddenly, a speck of illuminating dust emerged from the darkness and flew to Sakura. Then, a familiar voice sounded in Sakura’s mind and said, “You don’t have to be afraid. Something never goes away even after you make a choice. My child, there is hope as long as you’re still alive.”

        ‘Teacher…’ Looking at that speck of illuminating dust, Sakura was moved.

        “Yeah, I struggle to make a decision because I’m afraid of changes but changing is never wrong. Changes are both opportunities and hope!”

        Sakura blinked. She looked more determined than ever. Lowering her hand reverently, she clasped her hands and asked the Mother Tree, ‘Please release your power and lighten up our future!’

        At Sakura’s plea, the burning Mother Tree released a burst of blinding light. The eerie purple flames turned into white and burned even brighter.

        The magnificent Mother Tree withered and shrank in the white flames in an instant. Its body turned into numerous illuminating dust and scattered across the entire Plantdom like a milky way in a starry night, infiltrating every floral-elf’s body and bringing them new energy.

        Bathing in the Mother Tree’s last blessing, all the floral-elves uncontrollably shed tears of grief, mourning their mother who had given their land and their kingdom protection for years…</p>
