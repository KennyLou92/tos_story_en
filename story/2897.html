        <h1>Bellowing Conscience - Jichen</h1>
        <p>
                In the Deep Cloud Glen, two young men were fighting. It was evident that the older of the two had the upper hand as he effortlessly outmaneuvered his opponent with each move he made. Unsurprisingly, the young man was soon knocked to the ground after a series of exchanges.

        “You lost, Huaxi,” the elder petrogon, Ji Chen, looked down at the fallen youth, one of his fellow petrogons, Huaxi.

        “No…” Huaxi propped himself up with his sword. He wiped away the blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, his eyes showing a fiery determination as he said, “I can still fight!”

        “Can you? Then I shall beat you until you can’t,” Ji Chen proclaimed, accepting Huaxi’s challenge. His words brimmed with a confidence that befitted his title as the strongest dragon among all petrogons.

         Ji Chen, who no longer held back, unleashed all his power. With a final strike, he broke Huaxi’s sword in half, shattering the young man’s last hope of victory.

        “You lost. Admit it,” Ji Chen lowered his hands and stated unemotionally.

        “Dammit!” Huaxi thumped his fist loudly on the ground in frustration. He glared at Ji Chen and said, “Just you wait! I will defeat you!”

        With those words said, Huaxi turned on his heel and stormed away, leaving Ji Chen and the other petrogons behind.

        “Alas, Huaxi is still too young and proud. He shouldn’t have acted so recklessly even if he’s a prodigy who has cultivated his Lumin at a young age,” one of the elder petrogons regrettably remarked while shaking his head. However, Ji Chen did not agree. Instead, he commented with anticipation, “Is that so? I rather think it’s the opposite; his pride and his will to win will drive him forward. Given time, perhaps he may even surpass me someday.”

        Yet, Ji Chen underestimated Huaxi’s imprudence and stubbornness.

        One day, the sound of panic footsteps disrupted Ji Chen when he was going through his usual routine. He promptly paused his practice and approached his frantic clansman, asking gravely, “What happened?”

        “Ji Chen!” That patrogon rushed toward Ji Chen, grasping his sleeve as if clutching at straws, “You must go and save Huaxi!”

        “What?” Ji Chen, astonished by the clansman’s plea, grabbed his hand and pressed for detail, “Where is he?”

        “H-he went inside the Blue Arachnogator Cave. He told me to wait at the entrance, but I waited all morning and he never came out of there. I fear he’s been trapped inside,” the petrogon said.

        “Has he gone out of his mind? I have warned him that the blue arachnogators are very aggressive during their breeding season and they are pack hunters. Why would he even go there by himself? Was he trying to get himself KILLED?” Ji Chen exclaimed.

        “He said he was going to steal an arachnogator’s egg and make a sword that wouldn’t break easily… ”

        ‘That fool!’ Ji Chen recalled his last battle with Huaxi where he had sundered his sword, and he quickly realized that Huaxi must have mistaken the sword’s quality as the main reason for his defeat. He immediately said, “Take me there quickly!”

        And so, Ji Chen followed the petrogon to the entrance of the Blue Arachnogator Cave. It was pitch dark in the cave, making it impossible to see the end. One would be terrified to venture inside. However, the thought of Huaxi being trapped inside the cave spurred Ji Chen to the realization that waiting was not an option. He immediately turned and instructed the petrogon, “Go find the chief and bring more men to help with the search.”

        “Got it!”

        After the petrogon obediently departed, Ji Chen stealthily entered the cave, holding his breath and moved as quietly as possible lest he awakened the arachnogators. He tiptoed to the depths where the arachnogators laid their eggs. There he found Huaxi wrapped in a cocoon. It seemed that the arachnogators had only rendered Huaxi unconscious, intending to keep him as a reserve of food.

        ‘Now I just need to cut those silk threads to save him…’ Yet, Ji Chen hesitated. ‘But making a move now might alert the arachnogators. Perhaps it’s best to wait until the others arrive…’

        “Ugh…” Huaxi’s sudden groans of pain interrupted Ji Chen’s thought. It was then that he discovered that the silk threads had been draining Huaxi’s power to provide nutrients for the eggs.

        ‘These threads absorb elemental energy and it will eventually harm the captive’s soul. I must save Huaxi quickly, or else he’ll lose his power!’ Ji Chen, making his mind, channeled his power into his sword. With a swift swing of his sword, he cut all the threads surrounding Huaxi.

        A sharp hiss ensued and echoed through the cave as the cluster of arachnogators sensed the intruder, charging toward him.

        ‘I won’t let them hurt Huaxi!’ Ji Chen quickly summoned his power and transformed into his dragon form. He scooped the unconscious Huaxi with his tail, intending to escape before the arachnogators could reach him. Still, he was one step too late. A clutter of arachnogators had already gathered at the entrance, while another group closed in from behind, surrounding Ji Chen in a menacing circle.

        “Well, since it’s come to this, I shall fight my way out!” Strangely, Ji Chen mustered a steely determination in such a life-and-death situation. He unleashed all his power and valiantly fought against the arachnogators alone with all his might.

        Ji Chen lost track of time in the intense battle. His body was covered with wounds, from gashes to cuts, with blood flowing incessantly as time passed. His consciousness slowly faded as his wounds aggravated, and he fought purely on instinct toward the end.

        Still, Ji Chen never loosened his grip on Huaxi no matter how serious his injuries were. Eventually, he defeated all the arachnogators and dragged his Eventually, he defeated all the arachnogators body out of the cave. Only upon seeing his fellow petrogons did he finally succumb to darkness.

        When Ji Chen finally awakened, he learned that his Lumin had developed cracks from the bloodshed, learning the cruel fact that he had lost his formidable power as well as the title of the strongest warrior of petrogons…</p>
