        <h1>Blossoming Crescent - Artemis</h1>
        <p>        As the children of Zeus, Artemis and Apollo had been living on an island—just the two of them—until Zeus made Apollo the God of the Sun and separated them. On a random hunt, Artemis accidentally shot a human man in the foot and crippled him. Consumed with guilt, she carried him on her back and traveled around the realms as the emissary of Zeus.

        One day, Artemis found her bow on the cabinet missing when she was heading out of the log cabin in the woods as usual. While she was in a state of bewilderment, she heard a gentle male voice behind her back, asking, ‘Are you looking for this?’

        Artemis turned around and saw her bow in Orion’s hands. She took it and unexpectedly found that the scarred surface had been smoothened—clearly, someone had repaired it.

        ‘I saw your bow was pretty much worn so I slightly repaired it. It didn’t take much time. I… hope you won’t mind.’

        Although Orion told Artemis that it was nothing, she noticed the deep dark circles under his eyes. He must have stayed up all night just to fix her bow the night before.

        With that much effort spent to please Artemis, the man was too humble to even claim the credit. Seeing Orion like that, Artemis felt a sudden tingling twitch in her heart. To conceal this inexplicable feeling, she turned her face away. Looking down, she said in a deep voice, ‘Thank you, but you really didn’t have to do this.’

        Earlier, Orion confessed his feelings to Artemis but she turned him down. Even so, Orion did not give up but took good care of her the way he used to. His deep affection tingled Artemis’ heart. Still, she knew that she could not let go of Apollo. There was no room for another person in her heart, so she could only be cruel to Orion lest she led him on.

        Artemis’ hard-hearted words froze the air for a while. In the end, it was Orion, who broke the silence and said calmly with a smile, ‘I’m not asking for something in return. I’m not asking for a promise either. I just want to stay with you and take care of you. I’m happy as long as you’re happy.’

        Artemis almost fell for Orion so she could only run out of the door before she got drowned in his tenderness. Unable to take Orion out of her mind, Artemis accidentally fell into a pit after being attacked by some demons on the way.

        By then, the sun was already setting in the west. The orange sunlight shone on the woods, filtering through the leaves. Yet, it didn’t reach the depths of the pit. In the pitch dark, Artemis was covered in sweat with blood draining from her face, leaning against the cliff wall while holding her leg to check her calf which was pierced through by a branch.

        In fact, it was not such a serious wound for a god like Artemis. She only needed to pull out the branch and the wound would heal after resting for a day or two. However, pulling out the branch was the most difficult part because that short moment of pain could be heartbreaking.

        Watching her blood drip and form a small puddle on the ground, Artemis suddenly recalled that she had not been seriously injured ever since she grew up. She only had a serious injury when she was little—when Apollo was still by her side. Back then, they were attacked by a grizzly bear and Artemis almost got bitten while protecting her brother. Luckily, Apollo awakened his godly power just in time and repelled the beast.

        Terrified, the young Artemis clung to her brother tightly. The latter promised her that he would always protect her and become the light that brightens up her path, and no one could keep them apart. However, the vow later turned out to be broken with Apollo becoming the God of the Sun who brought sunlight to all mankind yet left Artemis alone.

        Artemis could not help thinking that maybe Apollo had already forgotten his promise for there were too many things that were more important than her. She was the only one who still remembered that promise and held onto the past. She kept chasing after him with just the thought of being with him, even if she had to be hurt to do so. She was being so stupid.

        Tears brimmed over Artemis’ eyes and streamed down her cheeks. Eventually, they fell off the edge of her chin and disappeared into the dark.

        ‘Perhaps it’s better for me to live in the night than under the scorching sunlight. I don’t deserve light anyway,’ thought Artemis miserably.

        As night alternated with day, the moon rose to the sky where black was the only color. It was even darker at the bottom of the pit, holding Artemis in boundless darkness.

        Suddenly, the sound of footsteps came from above. Artemis lifted her head, only to see a ball of bright fire that came from the torch in a fine teenager’s hand—it was Orion, bringing Artemis the only light in the dark. Even though he could not repel the darkness for Artemis, he could light up a fire for her.
　　
        Artemis looked at Orion. Not only did he bring the light, but he also brought life back to Artemis’ heart which had been withering in the shadows of loneliness, saving her from being drowned in the dark.

        The quavering voice of Orion came from the top of the pit. ‘Artemis! Are you alright?! Don’t worry! I’ll get you out right away! This pit is so deep. Should I get you a vine?’

        It would be easy for Artemis to climb out of the pit along the vine if she removed the branch in her calf, but she didn’t. Removing the branch could be very painful, but if she didn’t do it, the branch would lodge in her flesh and become a part of her. By that time, removing it would cause much pain. The branch was just like what Apollo meant to Artemis. 

        Artemis knew that it was time to rip off the bandaid. Why should she cling to someone when she knew that her feelings would never be reciprocated? So, gritting her teeth, Artemis pulled out the branch.

        ‘Argh!’ Artemis groaned in pain. A branch that was thick as half her arm was pulled out with blood dripping from its end. She hurled it to a corner as if she was throwing her past away. Then, she shouted at Orion, ‘I’m fine. Get me a vine and I’ll climb up!’

        Seeing Orion scouring around for vines, Artemis suddenly recalled her memories of Apollo standing in front of her and repelling the beasts when they were little. The two men were completely different: Apollo was valiant and charmingly imposing since he could drive away the beasts easily; Orion, on the other hand, was slow and clumsy. There was nothing about him that was as great as Apollo. Nonetheless, the two now looked similar in Artemis’ eyes.

        After Orion fixed the vine to a tree, Artemis endured the pain in her calf and climbed to the top of the pit step by step through willpower alone. When she almost reached the top, Orion reached out his hands and helped her up. Catching a glimpse of her injured calf, he said remorsefully, ‘It must hurt so badly.’

        ‘Yes, it is. But it won’t hurt anymore once the wound heals and turns into a memorable scar.’ Artemis gave him a smile of relief.

        When Orion leaned down to bandage Artemis’ wound, a crystal-clear moonstone fell out of his front pocket and rolled to Artemis. Artemis picked it up and asked, ‘What is this?’

        ‘I thought of you immediately when I saw it at the market, so I bought it. I was going to give it to you as a present later.’

        Surprised, Artemis delicately checked out the translucent crystal that was half the size of her palm in her hand. The crystal was still glowing in the place without the moonlight, gentle yet bright, like candlelight.

        Artemis loved it. Holding the moonstone to her chest, she asked, ‘But why all of a sudden?’

        ‘You like light, don’t you? I saw you always looking at the sun. But staring at the sun for too long can damage your eyes so I bought this. Its light is soft and harmless. Besides, it can stay with you forever and keep you from feeling lonely.’

        Orion gazed adoringly up at Artemis. In his eyes was an ocean of love, as gentle as the light of the moonstone, that swathed Artemis with never-ending warmth.

        ‘I should move on, and perhaps give this man who loves me so much a chance.’ Making up her mind, Artemis put a hand on Orion’s shoulder and whispered in his ear,  ‘Can you ask me again?’

        Dumbfounded by Artemis’ rarely close touch, Orion asked in a dorky way, ‘Ask… what?’

        Seeing the stupid look on Orion’s face, Artemis said with her lips curling up, ‘What you’ve been asking a lot these days.’

        Overwhelmed, Orion took a few seconds to process. Then a flood of emotions surged in his eyes, eventually turning into visible joy. He asked immediately, ‘Will you be with me?’

        ‘Yes.’ A captivating smile spread across Artemis’s face and it was as beautiful as the moon in the dark.</p>
