        <h1>Romantic Concerto - Tchaikovsky</h1>
        <p>According to the most ancient history, way back to the era when the primordial dragons created the universe, the lord of creation, Daoloth, used the power of constellations to create various instruments and played a requiem to save the lord of destruction, Azathoth, from the conflicting high-dimensional forces within its body.

        While they danced one last time to the requiem across the cosmos, Daoloth’s music—imbued with immense lifeforce—turned into countless seeds of life that scattered throughout space, and one seed took root on a star. Nourished by the emotions of the two transcendent beings, the seed quickly sprouted and came into bud. The buds, though vividly colored and radiant, were unable to bloom due to the leaden weight of their creator’s causality and destiny. It was not until the savior, Enoch, liberated the power of the origin that the buds were finally free from the shackles of fate and bloomed. From the blossoms a new life was formed: gods born in music, who were later known as the Consonias.

        From the moment of the Consonias’ birth, music had been everything to them; they expressed their emotions through songs and inspired creativity through melodies. Gradually, they cultivated their own culture and the unique legacy of melodists over the tides of time. The melodists saw creating harmonious music as their sole mission, vowing to praise the light and public virtues through their tune, and never play a note for individualism, darkness, and corruption.

        As time passed, the first generation of melodists eventually fell. New stars rose, and this is a story that unfolds among the younger generation…

        In the heart of Groove, the bustling capital, stood a magnificent building, the Saint Fleur Music Auditorium, and tonight the opulently designed grand hall was filled to capacity. Everyone waited with bated breath until the light came on. A stream of elegantly dressed men and women emerged from the backstage. They gracefully took their seats and summoned their instruments, ready to perform.

        In the front row, a boy no older than five or six craned his neck, eagerly scanning the stage. He turned to his mother, his voice filled with excitement as he asked, “Daddy? Where’s Daddy?”

        “Shh, keep your voice down,” she whispered, pointing to the right side of the stage, “Look, Daddy’s over there.”

        “Oh! I see him!” The boy covered his mouth. Still, it was not enough to muffle his excited exclaim. He waved enthusiastically at his father onstage.

        Despite the large crowd, the man onstage immediately noticed his son’s gesture. In response, he gave a subtle wave by lightly swaying the instrument in his hands without drawing unnecessary attention.

        “Daddy saw me!”

        “Yes, he did. Now sit down properly. The performance is about to start.”

        “Yes, ma’am!” The boy immediately straightened up in his chair, keeping a straight face. His overdramatic act made his mother let out a soft chuckle.

        Moments later, the concert began. The boy who had never attended a formal performance was overwhelmed by the performance. The music left him in a daze, lingering in his mind even after the performance ended.  It was not until he saw his father after the concert that he regained his senses.

        “Daddy, Daddy! You were amazing!” The boy darted into his father’s arms, his elfin face glowing with admiration. His eyes sparkled as he said, “I want to be a great melodist like you someday!”

        His father lifted him, a teasing smile on his face. “Well then, no more slacking off during practice, okay? Becoming a melodist isn’t easy.”

        “Um…” The boy hesitated, biting his lip. But after a moment, he clenched his tiny fists and nodded with determination, “Okay, I won’t slack off anymore!”

        “That’s my boy, Tchaikovsky! And Daddy will work hard too—maybe one day I can become a conductor and share the stage with you,” his father said wishfully.

        Unfortunately, that dream never came true.

        Years later, his father’s talent withered during dry spells, and he was reassigned as a tunesmith. Stripped of his place as a melodist of the orchestra, he could only watch from the shadows as his former peers continued to shine on stage. The weight of the bitter reality eventually crushed him. He resolutely resigned and opened a small restaurant in town to make ends meet.

        The loving father became a harsh and relentless man who pushed his lost dream onto his son, waking the boy before dawn every day to practice tirelessly until the stars emerged in the night sky.

        As his father wished, Tchaikovsky became a melodist. However, his father only grew even more controlling and oppressive, pushing him toward perfection through endless practices. He dictated everything—from the way Tchaikovsky expressed his music to the precise pressure of each finger on the instrument.

        Everything seemed to be a means to mold Tchaikovsky into his own image so that he could achieve the dream he could never realize.

        The family ties quickly deteriorated under his father’s twisted fixation. Arguments and fights became commonplace; the once warm and close-knit family lost its harmony. The deep-seated resentment against his father within Tchaikovsky slowly turned into hate for music which now only filled him with bitterness and rage.

        Music had brought him and his father pain and despair as much as the hope and joy they had felt in the past. It was a vicious cycle, an endless loop that left nothing but emptiness—like the inevitable end of all living things.

        One day, Tchaikovsky left home early. He wandered aimlessly on the streets and eventually ended up in a bar where he spent the night drinking and dancing until the early hours. Only then did he finally stumble back home reeking of alcohol and smoke.

        The moment he opened the door, he froze, startled by a shadowy figure standing in the doorway. He frantically fumbled for the light switch and reflexively shut his eyes at the bright light. When he finally adjusted to the brightness, he opened his eyes only to meet his father’s cold, expressionless gaze.

        “Ugh! Don’t stand there like that,” Tchaikovsky grumbled, rubbing his face and glaring at his father in annoyance. “You scared me! I thought some of those anti-Court thugs had broken into our home.”

        “Where have you been?” His father’s fury erupted at the sight of Tchaikovsky’s disheveled appearance. “You have a performance tomorrow, and yet you’ve been out all night! How do you expect to become a conductor like this?”

        “Enough!” Tchaikovsky snapped as he saw that familiar look of disappointment on his father’s face. A wave of frustration surged within him. His churning emotions turned into a helpless roar, “I’ve never wanted to be a conductor! That’s your dream!”

        At that moment, Tchaikovsky felt like his entire life was a cruel joke. He was nothing more than a tool to fulfill his father’s ambitions; he had no worth without the title of a melodist. The realization left him hollow, unsure what meaning his music—or his life—held. 

        Once, he had clung to the idea of love and family, but he had grown exhausted over the years. He now felt nothing but lethargic, and with a sudden burst of resolve, he placed his hand on the sigil on his skin and summoned his instrument. Lifting it high, he smashed it against the ground with all his strength.

        CLANG! The instrument—just like the bond between them—shattered into pieces.

        “YOU—” His father’s shock quickly turned into rage. “How could you destroy your instrument? HOW are you going to perform tomorrow?”

        “I won’t perform then,” Tchaikovsky shrugged. “I’m done being a melodist. Honestly, I hate music. I hate the Orchestra. I HATE it so much I wish it would all just disappear!”

        Before his father could react, Tchaikovsky turned and bolted out of the house, the place that now gave him nothing but suffocation. He kept running aimlessly through the empty streets until he reached the seaside promenade. He sank into a bench and stared out at the vast, tranquil ocean, his heart filled with helplessness and confusion.

        Like a wounded child, he buried his face in his knees, trying to shut out the world and escape from reality. However, the world refused to leave him alone.

        Three figures silently approached him. By the time Tchaikovsky looked up in vigilance, he found himself surrounded by three masked men.

        “W-What do you want?!” he stammered.

        “You people in the Court are too arrogant!” one of them sneered as he noticed Tchaikovsky’s uniform.

        “You’re the rebels who oppose the Court!” Tchaikovsky immediately realized.

        Born from the seed of music, the Consonias held music in the highest regard, and they revered the Court of Music, a governing body formed by orchestras that commanded enormous power, even greater than administrative institutions.

        A significant portion of social resources was allocated to supporting the operations of the Court of Music, which bred resentment among those outside the organization. The social discontent gave rise to radical factions that secretly formed anti-Court organizations. Some even plotted extreme actions—including ambushing lone melodists and—what melodists feared the most—crippling their ability to play music.

        “You all think you’re so great when all you do is play instruments! Where do think you get the money and resources to squander if it weren’t for us working quietly in the shadows?” Another man clicked his tongue.

        “Enough talk. Let’s take out his hands!” 

        The men lunged at Tchaikovsky and pinned him down. While the other two gripped his hands tightly, the last one pulled out a hammer, ready to strike—

        ‘No! I need my hands to play music!’ The imminent danger of losing his hands forced Tchaikovsky to face his true desires. Despite his hatred for music and his resentment over his father’s twisted obsession, he could not bear the thought of never playing a song again. Summoning every ounce of strength, he broke free from their grip and shielded his hands with his body.

        “Fine! If your hands mean that much to you, I’ll just kill you instead!” The man shouted as he raised his weapon. However, just as he swung it, a mournful melody reached his ear, freezing him in place with a haunting tune.

        “Damn it… it’s someone from the Court!” The paralyzed man bitterly gritted his teeth. The melody shifted into a gentle lullaby, and one by one, the attackers succumbed to its power and drifted into a deep sleep.

        Meanwhile, Tchaikovsky, as a melodist who had a higher resistance to music, remained unaffected by the music. He raised his head only to see a figure emerge from the shadows—a girl holding a violin. She had such an unmistakably commanding and charismatic presence that Tchaikovsky recognized her immediately.

        “It’s you—Mozart of the Rhapsody Orchestra!” Tchaikovsky gasped in surprise.

        Mozart frowned slightly at his rather impolite shout, but she quickly composed herself and said, “You’re… Tchaikovsky, a melodist of the Nocturne Orchestra… As I recall, shouldn’t you be preparing for tomorrow’s concert? Why are you wandering the streets at this early hour?”

        “I…” Tchaikovsky hesitated, but he then thought, ‘Mozart is one of the most talented melodists of our generation. Maybe… maybe she has the answer to my question.’

        Instead of explaining himself, he asked, “Why did you become a melodist?”

        Mozart looked surprised but she soon realized when she saw the confusion in his eyes. She let out a soft sigh before answering his question, “Because I want to play my own music. What about you?”

        “I… I don’t know. I became a melodist because of my father’s expectations… I hate music… I hate performing…”

        “Yet you were willing to risk your life to protect your hands. If you truly hated music that much, why would you do that?” Mozart asked.

        “But music has only brought me pain. My father forced me to become the melodist he once was… And now I don’t even know why I’m playing anymore…”

        “That’s because you’ve never played for yourself. How can you feel the beautiful essence of music when you’re burdened by someone else’s expectations and dreams?”

        “Then… what should I do?” Tchaikovsky looked at Mozart, his eyes filled with confusion.

        “Resist. Fight. Overthrow who’s in your way—” Mozart looked at him straight in the eye, her eyes burning with conviction as she said the most powerful words, “—with your own music.”

        “With my own music...”  Tchaikovsky repeated the words. His gloomy expression gradually brightened as if he had found a guiding star in the dark.

        ‘I don’t hate music itself; what I truly hate is being forced to be someone I’m not. I used to love playing music. I was free, unconfined by anyone’s expectations, and that allowed me to play as who I truly was. Now I know. I won’t let family ties hold me back anymore. I’m going to rediscover music and create my own melodies!’</p>
